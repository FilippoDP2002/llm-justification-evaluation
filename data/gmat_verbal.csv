You are a GMAT expert specializing in Reading Comprehension. Your task is to carefully read the provided passage and answer the question that follows. Focus on understanding the main idea, supporting details, author's purpose, and inferences that can be drawn from the passage. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Scientists long believed that two nerve clusters in the human hypothalamus, called suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCNs), were what controlled our circadian rhythms. Those rhythms are the biological cycles that recur approximately every 24 hours in synchronization with the cycle of sunlight and darkness caused by Earth’s rotation. Studies have demonstrated that in some animals, the SCNs control daily fluctuations in blood pressure, body temperature, activity level, and alertness, as well as the nighttime release of the sleep-promoting agent melatonin. Furthermore, cells in the human retina dedicated to transmitting information about light levels to the SCNs have recently been discovered.  Four critical genes governing circadian cycles have been found to be active in every tissue, however, not just the SCNs, of flies, mice, and humans. In addition, when laboratory rats that usually ate at will were fed only once a day, peak activity of a clock gene in their livers shifted by 12 hours, whereas the same clock gene in the SCNs remained synchronized with light cycles. While scientists do not dispute the role of the SCNs in controlling core functions such as the regulation of body temperature and blood pressure, scientists now believe that circadian clocks in other organs and tissues may respond to external cues other than light—including temperature changes—that recur regularly every 24 hours.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. challenge recent findings that appear to contradict earlier findings
B: B. present two sides of an ongoing scientific debate
C: C. report answers to several questions that have long puzzled researchers
D: D. discuss evidence that has caused a long-standing belief to be revised
E: E. attempt to explain a commonly misunderstood biological phenomenon

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole. The passage begins by describing a long-held belief regarding humans’ circadian rhythms: that the SCNs control them. It then goes on to explain that new findings have led scientists to believe that other organs and tissues may be involved in regulating the body’s circadian rhythms as well.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not challenge the more-recent findings. Furthermore, the recent findings that the passage recounts do not contradict earlier findings; rather, when placed alongside those earlier findings, they have led scientists to reach additional conclusions.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not discuss a two-sided debate; no findings or conclusions are disputed by any figures in the passages.
Explanation C: C. There is only one question at issue in the passage: whether the SCN alone control human circadian rhythms. Furthermore, nothing in the passage suggests that researchers have been puzzled for a long time about this.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The new evidence regarding circadian rhythm–related gene activity in all the body’s tissue has led scientists to revise their long-standing belief that the SCN alone control circadian rhythms.
Explanation E: E. The biological phenomenon of circadian rhythms is not, at least as far as the passage is concerned, misunderstood. Its causes are being investigated and refined.

A: A. activity level
B: B. blood pressure
C: C. alertness
D: D. vision
E: E. temperature

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question asks about what is NOT specifically mentioned in the passage with regard to functions regulated by the SCN. Those functions, as identified in the passage, are blood pressure, body temperature, activity level, alertness, and the release of melatonin.
Explanation A: A. The passage includes activity level in its list of functions regulated by the SCN.
Explanation B: B. The passage includes blood pressure in its list of functions regulated by the SCN.
Explanation C: C. The passage includes alertness in its list of functions regulated by the SCN.
Explanation D: D. Correct. While the passage does say that cells in the human retina transmit information to the SCN, there is no suggestion that the SCN reciprocally control vision.
Explanation E: E. The passage includes temperature in its list of functions regulated by the SCN.

### Question:
The author of the passage would probably agree with which of the following statements about the SCNs?
A: A. The SCNs are found in other organs and tissues of the body besides the hypothalamus.
B: B. The SCNs play a critical but not exclusive role in regulating circadian rhythms.
C: C. The SCNs control clock genes in a number of tissues and organs throughout the body.
D: D. The SCNs are a less significant factor in regulating blood pressure than scientists once believed.
E: E. The SCNs are less strongly affected by changes in light levels than they are by other external cues.

### Response:
<think>
Application The author of the passage states in the second paragraph, Four critical genes governing circadian cycles have been found to be active in every tissue, however, not just in the SCNs, of flies, mice, and humans. The author goes on in that paragraph to point out that though scientists still accept the role of SCNs in controlling core functions, they now believe that circadian clocks in other organs and tissues may respond to external cues other than light . . . that recur regularly every 24 hours. The author nowhere disputes these beliefs, and so it is reasonable to conclude that the author of the passage agrees that these beliefs are true.
Explanation A: A. The author states that the SCNs are nerve clusters in the hypothalamus, and nothing in the passage contradicts or undermines the supposition that they are only in the hypothalamus.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The author indicates in the second paragraph that while scientists still believe that the SCNs control core circadian function, they also believe that circadian clocks found elsewhere in the body have an effect as well. Because the author nowhere disputes these beliefs, it is reasonable to conclude that the author would agree that SCNs play a critical but not exclusive role in regulating circadian rhythms.
Explanation C: C. The evidence offered in the second paragraph about the activity of the clock gene in rat livers suggests that these clock genes are not under the SCNs’ control. The passage does not suggest that the SCNs control any of the non-SCN controllers of circadian rhythms.
Explanation D: D. The author states in the second paragraph that scientists do not dispute the idea that the SCNs regulate blood pressure.
Explanation E: E. The first paragraph indicates that the SCNs respond to light levels; clock genes in other tissues are the ones that may respond to other external cues.

### Passage:
In their study of whether offering a guarantee of service quality will encourage customers to visit a particular restaurant, Tucci and Talaga have found that the effect of such guarantees is mixed. For higher-priced restaurants, there is some evidence that offering a guarantee increases the likelihood of customer selection, probably reflecting the greater financial commitment involved in choosing an expensive restaurant. For lower-priced restaurants, where one expects less assiduous service, Tucci and Talaga found that a guarantee could actually have a negative effect: a potential customer might think that a restaurant offering a guarantee is worried about its service. Moreover, since customers understand a restaurant’s product and know what to anticipate in terms of service, they are empowered to question its quality. This is not generally true in the case of skilled activities such as electrical work, where, consequently, a guarantee might have greater customer appeal.  For restaurants generally, the main benefit of a service guarantee probably lies not so much in customer appeal as in managing and motivating staff. Staff members would know what service standards are expected of them and also know that the success of the business relies on their adhering to those standards. Additionally, guarantees provide some basis for defining the skills needed for successful service in areas traditionally regarded as unskilled, such as waiting tables.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. question the results of a study that examined the effect of service-quality guarantees in the restaurant industry
B: B. discuss potential advantages and disadvantages of service-quality guarantees in the restaurant industry
C: C. examine the conventional wisdom regarding the effect of service-quality guarantees in the restaurant industry
D: D. argue that only certain restaurants would benefit from the implementation of service- quality guarantees
E: E. consider the impact that service-quality guarantees can have on the service provided by a restaurant

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole. The first paragraph describes Tucci and Talaga’s findings regarding the effect of service-quality guarantees: that they have different, more positive results for higher-priced restaurants than for lower-priced ones, which could be affected negatively. The second paragraph explains that a particular benefit from service guarantees could accrue to restaurants generally.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not question the results of Tucci and Talaga’s study; rather, the passage appears to accept the results of the study as accurate.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The potential advantages involve the management and motivation of service staff, as well as, for higher-priced restaurants, a greater likelihood of being selected by customers over other restaurants. Potential disadvantages for lower-priced restaurants include the possibility that potential customers may believe that such restaurants are concerned about the quality of their service.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate whether there is any conventional wisdom regarding service-quality guarantees in the restaurant industry.
Explanation D: D. The second paragraph of the passage suggests that restaurants in general could potentially enjoy some benefits from the implementation of service-quality guarantees. For lower-priced restaurants, these benefits could offset the possible negative effects of service-quality guarantees described in the first paragraph.
Explanation E: E. The second paragraph of the passage indicates an effect that service-quality guarantees could have on a restaurant’s staff and the service that the staff provides, but this is only one of the subsidiary points contributing to the focus of the passage as a whole. The first is more concerned with the question of what effect these guarantees would have on whether customers choose to patronize that restaurant.

### Question:
It can be inferred that the author of the passage would agree with which of the following statements about the appeal of service guarantees to customers?
A: A. Such guarantees are likely to be somewhat more appealing to customers of restaurants than to customers of other businesses.
B: B. Such guarantees are likely to be more appealing to customers who know what to anticipate in terms of service.
C: C. Such guarantees are likely to have less appeal in situations where customers are knowledgeable about a business’s product or service.
D: D. In situations where a high level of financial commitment is involved, a service guarantee is not likely to be very appealing.
E: E. In situations where customers expect a high level of customer service, a service guarantee is likely to make customers think that a business is worried about its service.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question asks for an inference from the passage about the author’s view of why and how service guarantees would appeal to customers. The question does not ask specifically about service guarantees in the context of restaurants, but rather service guarantees in general. The end of the first paragraph addresses this general question: a service guarantee may appeal most to customers in the case of activities whose quality they are less likely to know how to question.
Explanation A: A. The author states that a service guarantee might have greater appeal in the case of skilled activities than it would for restaurant customers.
Explanation B: B. According to the author, customers who know what to expect in terms of service—a group that includes restaurant customers—would likely find service guarantees less appealing.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The author makes clear that service guarantees would be less appealing to restaurant customers when they know what to expect in terms of the quality of service.
Explanation D: D. The passage provides some evidence that where a high level of financial commitment is involved, a service guarantee may be more rather than less appealing than in other situations. In discussing higher-priced restaurants, which require a relatively high level of financial commitment, the author states that Tucci and Talaga found evidence that a service guarantee would likely appeal to customers.
Explanation E: E. The author implies that customers of higher-priced restaurants expect a high level of service, certainly a level higher than that expected by customers of lower-priced restaurants. But it is at lower-priced restaurants that Tucci and Talaga found that a service guarantee makes customers think a given restaurant is concerned about its service.

Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage explicitly indicates that Tucci and Talaga found that potential customers of lower-priced restaurants could interpret service guarantees as indicating worries about the quality of service.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates that Tucci and Talaga found that customers might think that lower- priced restaurants are offering service guarantees because they are concerned that the quality of their service is too low, but the passage does not indicate that service guarantees lead such restaurants to have concerns about the quality of their service, and in fact it may be that such guarantees could lead to improvements in service.
Explanation E: E. The passage indicates that service guarantees offered at lower-priced restaurants may empower customers to question the quality of service, but it does not indicate that service guarantees lead restaurants to have concerns about this.

C Main Idea Summary The passage primarily reports some research findings regarding the extent to which farmers in certain types of rain-forest regions are likely to adopt technologies that would increase productivity and slow deforestation by reducing demand for new cropland. It begins by noting that some studies have not included the types of farming communities that are characteristic of rain- forest regions. The latter part of the passage describes some research regarding these previously omitted communities. The findings of that research provide evidence of how various factors may influence whether farmers in those communities adopt improved plant varieties and/or chemical herbicides."

Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
One proposal for preserving rain forests is to promote the adoption of new agricultural technologies, such as improved plant varieties and use of chemical herbicides, which would increase productivity and slow deforestation by reducing demand for new cropland. Studies have shown that farmers in developing countries who have achieved certain levels of education, wealth, and security of land tenure are more likely to adopt such technologies. But these studies have focused on villages with limited land that are tied to a market economy rather than on the relatively isolated, selfsufficient communities with ample land characteristic of rain-forest regions. A recent study of the Tawahka people of the Honduran rain forest found that farmers with some formal education were more likely to adopt improved plant varieties but less likely to use chemical herbicides and that those who spoke Spanish (the language of the market economy) were more likely to adopt both technologies. Nonland wealth was also associated with more adoption of both technologies, but availability of uncultivated land reduced the incentive to employ the productivityenhancing technologies. Researchers also measured land-tenure security: in Tawahka society, kinship ties are a more important indicator of this than are legal property rights, so researchers measured it by a household’s duration of residence in its village. They found that longer residence correlated with more adoption of improved plant varieties but less adoption of chemical herbicides.

### Question:
The passage suggests that in the study mentioned in line 14, the method for gathering information about security of land tenure reflects which of the following pairs of assumptions about Tawahka society?
A: A. The security of a household’s land tenure depends on the strength of that household’s kinship ties, and the duration of a household’s residence in its village is an indication of the strength of that household’s kinship ties.
B: B. The ample availability of land makes security of land tenure unimportant, and the lack of a need for secure land tenure has made the concept of legal property rights unnecessary.
C: C. The strength of a household’s kinship ties is a more reliable indicator of that household’s receptivity to new agricultural technologies than is its quantity of nonland wealth, and the duration of a household’s residence in its village is a more reliable indicator of that household’s security of land tenure than is the strength of its kinship ties.
D: D. Security of land tenure based on kinship ties tends to make farmers more receptive to the use of improved plant varieties, and security of land tenure based on long duration of residence in a village tends to make farmers more receptive to the use of chemical herbicides.
E: E. A household is more likely to be receptive to the concept of land tenure based on legal property rights if it has easy access to uncultivated land, and a household is more likely to uphold the tradition of land tenure based on kinship ties if it possesses a significant degree of nonland wealth.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation In discussing the study, the passage notes that the strength of kinship ties is a more important indicator of land-tenure security than are legal property rights. The researchers, knowing this, measured land-tenure security by indirectly measuring the strength of kinship ties. How long a household had resided in its village was taken as an indicator of the strength of kinship ties and, indirectly, of the household’s degree of land-tenure security.
Explanation A: A. Correct. This summarizes two assumptions that the passage suggests were made by the researchers.
Explanation B: B. The passage notes that ample availability of land is characteristic of rain-forest communities, which presumably includes the Tawahka people on whom the study focused. However, based on the information in the passage, the study did not assume that land-tenure security was unimportant in that community.
Explanation C: C. The passage reports that the study took a household’s duration of residence in its village as a reliable indicator of the strength of the household’s kinship ties. Thus, the researchers did not assume that duration of residence was a more reliable measure of land-tenure security than kinship ties.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not indicate that the researchers assumed this. As already stated, the researchers in effect equated a household’s strength of kinship ties with its length of residence in its village. Though only the latter was directly measured, both were regarded as guarantors and indicators of land-tenure security. According to the passage, the researchers found that longer residence correlated with more adoption of improved plant varieties but with less adoption of chemical herbicides. This was a finding based on research data, not an assumption.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not attribute to the researchers an assumption that a household is more likely to be receptive to the concept of land tenure based on legal property rights if it has easy access to uncultivated land.

E: E. reduce their need to clear new land for cultivation

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The goal of the proposal is to help preserve rain forests by encouraging the adoption of new agricultural technologies, including use of chemical herbicides. The latter would presumably help improve crop yields on existing land, reducing the need to clear portions of rain forest to expand agricultural production.
Explanation A: A. The proposal aims to encourage farmers to adopt new agricultural technologies.
Explanation B: B. The proposal aims to encourage farmers to grow improved plant varieties.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The proposal aims to encourage farmers to adopt new agricultural technologies, such as increased use of chemical herbicides. So persuading farmers to reduce their use of chemical herbicides is not part of the proposal.

C Main Idea Summary The passage as a whole functions as an introduction to the notion of monetizing (i.e., putting a monetary value on) ecosystem functions. The passage begins by considering the argument for monetizing such functions and then considers David Pearce’s claim that all ecosystems have economic value and that, by showing this, we can help overcome the illusion that conservation is relatively unprofitable. The passage concludes with Gretchen Daily’s view that monetization will help inform environmental decision-making."

Focus on understanding the main idea, supporting details, author's purpose, and inferences that can be drawn from the passage. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
The argument for “monetizing”—or putting a monetary value on—ecosystem functions may be stated thus: Concern about the depletion of natural resources is widespread, but this concern, in the absence of an economic argument for conservation, has not translated into significant conservational progress. Some critics blame this impasse on environmentalists, whom they believe fail to address the economic issues of environmental degradation. Conservation can appear unprofitable when compared with the economic returns derived from converting natural assets (pristine coastlines, for example) into explicitly commercial ones (such as resort hotels). But according to David Pearce, that illusion stems from the fact that “services” provided by ecological systems are not traded on the commodities market, and thus have no readily quantifiable value. To remedy this, says Pearce, one has to show that all ecosystems have economic value—indeed, that all ecological services are economic services. Tourists visiting wildlife preserves, for example, create jobs and generate income for national economies; undisturbed forests and wetlands regulate water runoff and act as water-purifying systems, saving millions of dollars worth of damage to property and to marine ecosystems. In Gretchen Daily’s view, monetization, while unpopular with many environmentalists, reflects the dominant role that economic considerations play in human behavior, and the expression of economic value in a common currency helps inform environmental decision-making processes.

### Question:
Information in the passage suggests that David Pearce would most readily endorse which of the following statements concerning monetization?
A: A. Monetization represents a strategy that is attractive to both environmentalists and their critics.
B: B. Monetization is an untested strategy, but it is increasingly being embraced by environmentalists.
C: C. Monetization should at present be restricted to ecological services and should only gradually be extended to such commercial endeavors as tourism and recreation.
D: D. Monetization can serve as a means of representing persuasively the value of environmental conservation.
E: E. Monetization should inform environmental decision-making processes only if it is accepted by environmentalist groups.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question requires an understanding of David Pearce’s view of monetization. According to the passage, Pearce finds the idea that conservation is unprofitable to be an illusion. He argues for showing the economic value of ecosystems in order to make progress in conserving those ecosystems.
Explanation A: A. The passage attributes to Gretchen Daily the view that monetization is unpopular with environmentalists. The passage gives no reason to believe that Pearce would endorse the idea that environmentalists currently find monetization attractive.
Explanation B: B. The passage gives no indication that monetization is increasingly being embraced by environmentalists, even if Pearce thinks it should be.
Explanation C: C. The passage indicates Pearce’s belief that some types of tourism are also types of ecological services that have economic value and that they should be monetized.
Explanation D: D. Correct. Pearce believes that monetization quantifies the value of the services provided by ecological systems—and if that value is quantified, people are more likely to be persuaded to conserve those systems.
Explanation E: E. Pearce is arguing, against some environmentalists, that monetization should inform the decision-making process with regard to preserving ecosystems.

Focus on understanding the main idea, supporting details, author's purpose, and inferences that can be drawn from the passage. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
The argument for “monetizing”—or putting a monetary value on—ecosystem functions may be stated thus: Concern about the depletion of natural resources is widespread, but this concern, in the absence of an economic argument for conservation, has not translated into significant conservational progress. Some critics blame this impasse on environmentalists, whom they believe fail to address the economic issues of environmental degradation. Conservation can appear unprofitable when compared with the economic returns derived from converting natural assets (pristine coastlines, for example) into explicitly commercial ones (such as resort hotels). But according to David Pearce, that illusion stems from the fact that “services” provided by ecological systems are not traded on the commodities market, and thus have no readily quantifiable value. To remedy this, says Pearce, one has to show that all ecosystems have economic value—indeed, that all ecological services are economic services. Tourists visiting wildlife preserves, for example, create jobs and generate income for national economies; undisturbed forests and wetlands regulate water runoff and act as water-purifying systems, saving millions of dollars worth of damage to property and to marine ecosystems. In Gretchen Daily’s view, monetization, while unpopular with many environmentalists, reflects the dominant role that economic considerations play in human behavior, and the expression of economic value in a common currency helps inform environmental decision-making processes.

### Question:
Which of the following most clearly represents an example of an “ecological service” as that term is used in line 20?
A: A. A resort hotel located in an area noted for its natural beauty
B: B. A water-purifying plant that supplements natural processes with nontoxic chemicals
C: C. A wildlife preserve that draws many international travelers
D: D. A nonprofit firm that specializes in restoring previously damaged ecosystems
E: E. A newsletter that keeps readers informed of ecological victories and setbacks

### Response:
<think>
Application Based on the passage, ecological services are services provided by natural assets that have not been converted into commercial assets. Thus, any example of such an ecological service requires that the area providing it is natural.
Explanation A: A. The passage mentions resort hotels as an example of explicitly commercial assets. Although some hotels might be situated in ecologically valuable natural environments, any ecological services in such cases would be contributed by the natural environments, not by the hotels themselves.
Explanation B: B. Water purifying is an ecological service if it is supplied by undisturbed forests and wetlands. The word plant here must mean a technological installation, not a botanical organism, because it is said to supplement—not to be part of—the natural processes. Thus, it is not a natural asset and therefore does not provide an ecological service as described in the passage.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage states that a wildlife preserve that creates jobs and generates income would be providing an ecological service.
Explanation D: D. A nonprofit firm that restores damaged ecosystems would be performing a valuable ecology-related service, but it would not itself be an example of a natural asset providing an ecological service.
Explanation E: E. Environmentalists and others would most likely find such a newsletter informative, but it would not be an ecological service, because it is not a service provided by a natural asset.

### Question:
According to the passage, Daily sees monetization as an indication of which of the following?
A: A. The centrality of economic interests to people’s actions
B: B. The reluctance of the critics of environmentalism to acknowledge the importance of conservation
C: C. The inability of financial interests and ecological interests to reach a common ideological ground
D: D. The inevitability of environmental degradation
E: E. The inevitability of the growth of ecological services in the future

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question asks about Daily’s view of monetization, and according to the passage, she sees monetization as a practice that reflects the dominant role that economic decisions play in human behavior.
Explanation A: A. Correct. According to the passage, Daily believes that economic interests are central to people’s actions, and monetization of ecological services would take that central role realistically into account.
Explanation B: B. The passage gives no evidence of this. It says nothing about how the concept of monetization relates to critics of environmentalism or about what Daily’s opinion regarding such a relationship might be. It is reasonable to suppose that some critics of environmentalism would oppose the move to monetize the values of ecosystem functions because they believe that many ecosystem functions do not have true monetary value. However, the passage mentions Daily’s views on the topic only as they relate to environmentalists, not to critics of environmentalism.
Explanation C: C. This is the opposite of what, according to the passage, Daily says can be a benefit of monetization. For Daily, monetization represents a way for financial interests and ecological interests to reach a common ground; by using this common currency, both sides can make good decisions about the environment.
Explanation D: D. Monetization, in Daily’s view, would help to prevent environmental degradation; the passage does not suggest that she regards such degradation as at all inevitable.
Explanation E: E. Daily does not see monetization as inevitably spurring the growth of ecological services but as more likely preventing their decline by leaving those services undisturbed.

### Question:
Which of the following can be inferred from the passage concerning the environmentalists mentioned in line 8?
A: A. They are organized in opposition to the generation of income produced by the sale of ecological services.
B: B. They are fewer in number but better organized and better connected to the media than their opponents.
C: C. They have sometimes been charged with failing to use a particular strategy in their pursuit of conservational goals.
D: D. They have been in the forefront of publicizing the extent of worldwide environmental degradation.
E: E. They define environmental progress differently and more conservatively than do other organized groups of environmentalists.

### Response:
<think>
Inference The sentence in question states that critics blame environmentalists for their failure to address the economic issues of environmental degradation.
Explanation A: A. The passage states that, in the absence of monetization, conservation can appear unprofitable. But this does not mean that the environmentalists in question are opposed to conservation generating income.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not address the issue of the number of environmentalists in question, the number of those opposed to them, or whether either group is better connected to the media.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage indicates that critics of the environmentalists in question believe environmentalists are to blame for not using an effective economics-based strategy to promote conservation.
Explanation D: D. Although it may be the case that the environmentalists in question have been prominent in publicizing worldwide environmental degradation, the passage does not provide grounds for inferring that the possibility is necessarily true.
Explanation E: E. The passage suggests that certain critics consider environmentalists in general to be at fault for failing to address economic issues. In this respect, the passage makes no distinctions among different environmentalist groups, organized or otherwise, yet this answer choice is based on the assumption that the passage has made this distinction. Therefore, this answer choice cannot be inferred from the passage.

C Main Idea Summary The passage consists of a brief overview of some research into a question related to marketing: how do various factors influence consumers’ perceptions of performance risk (the possibility that a product will not function as consumers expect and/or will not provide the desired benefits)? The first paragraph reports some purported findings about the effects of price and advertising on such perceptions. The second paragraph reports some research into the ways in which perceptions of manufacturers’ credibility may influence perceptions of performance risk. It then briefly discusses the possibility that some of the factors may interact with one another in more complex ways."

Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Much research has been devoted to investigating what motivates consumers to try new products. Previous consumer research suggests that both the price of a new product and the way it is advertised affect consumers’ perceptions of the product’s performance risk (the possibility that the product will not function as consumers expect and/or will not provide the desired benefits). Some of this research has concluded that a relatively high price will reduce a consumer’s perception of the performance risk associated with purchasing a particular product, while other studies have reported that price has little or no effect on perceived performance risk. These conflicting findings may simply be due to the nature of product advertisements: a recent study indicates that the presentation of an advertised message has a marked effect on the relationship between price and perceived performance risk.  Researchers have identified consumers’ perception of the credibility of the source of an advertised message—i.e., the manufacturer—as another factor affecting perceived performance risk: one study found that the greater the source credibility, the lower the consumer’s perception of the risk of purchasing an advertised new product. However, past research suggests that the relationship between source credibility and perceived performance risk may be more complex: source credibility may interact with price in a subtle way to affect consumers’ judgments of the performance risk associated with an advertised product.

### Question:
According to the passage, the studies referred to in line 12 reported which of the following about the effect of price on consumers’ perception of the performance risk associated with a new product?
A: A. Although most consumers regard price as an important factor, their perception of the performance risk associated with a new product is ultimately determined by the manufacturer’s reputation.
B: B. Price interacts with the presentation of an advertised message to affect perceived performance risk.
C: C. Price does not significantly affect consumers’ perception of the performance risk associated with a new product.
D: D. Consumers tend to regard price as more important than the manufacturer’s credibility when they are buying from that manufacturer for the first time.
E: E. Consumers are generally less concerned about a new product’s performance risk when that product is relatively expensive.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The question asks about information explicitly provided in the passage. The first paragraph explains that there are conflicting findings in the research about how the price of a product affects a consumer’s perception of the performance risk of that product. Some studies have found that higher priced products reduce the perception of performance risk. The other studies referred to in line 12, however, have found little or no connection between price and perceived performance risk.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not mention that these studies consider the manufacturer’s reputation.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not mention that these studies consider advertising messages.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage indicates that these studies have found little or no connection between relative price and consumers’ perception of performance risk.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not mention that these studies consider the manufacturer’s credibility.
Explanation E: E. Although some studies have found that a relatively high price reduces the perception of performance risk, the passage explains that the studies referred to in line 12 have not confirmed that finding.

### Question:
The “past research” mentioned in line 25 suggests which of the following about perceived performance risk?
A: A. The more expensive a new product is, the more likely consumers may be to credit advertised claims about that product.
B: B. The more familiar consumers are with a particular manufacturer, the more willing they may be to assume some risk in the purchase of a new product being advertised by that manufacturer.
C: C. Consumers’ perception of the performance risk associated with a new product being advertised may be influenced by an interplay between the product’s price and the manufacturer’s credibility.
D: D. Consumers may be more likely to believe that a product will function as it is advertised to do when they have bought products from a particular manufacturer before.
E: E. The price of a particular advertised product may have less impact than the manufacturer’s credibility on consumers’ assessment of the performance risk associated with that product.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The question asks about information explicitly provided in the passage. The second paragraph explains that, according to some research, consumers perceive a product as having less performance risk when they trust the source of advertising about that product. Past research, however, suggests that performance risk is affected not merely by the credibility of the source, but by an interaction between source credibility and the price of the product.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not indicate that the past research addressed the question of how the price of a product affects consumers’ perception of advertised claims. It only says that the research suggests that the two factors interact.
Explanation B: B. Although the passage discusses consumers’ perception of how risky a purchase might be, it does not address the relationship between familiarity and willingness to assume risk.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The past research suggests that performance risk is affected by an interaction between the price of the product and the credibility of the source of the advertising about the product—in other words, the manufacturer.
Explanation D: D. The past research suggests that consumers’ beliefs about a product’s performance are affected not merely by their perception of the manufacturer, but by an interplay between source credibility and product price. The passage does not mention any possible role of prior experience in this interplay.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not discuss whether price or the manufacturer’s credibility has more of an effect on perceived performance risk.

However, past research suggests that the relationship between source credibility and perceived performance risk may be more complex: source credibility may interact with price in a subtle way to affect consumers’ judgments of the performance risk associated with an advertised product.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, would most tend to weaken the conclusion drawn from “some of this research” (line 8)?
A: A. In a subsequent study, consumers who were asked to evaluate new products with relatively low prices had the same perception of the products’ performance risk as did consumers who were shown the same products priced more expensively.
B: B. In a subsequent study, the quality of the advertising for the products that consumers perceived as having a lower performance risk was relatively high, while the quality of the advertising for the products that consumers perceived as having a higher performance risk was relatively poor.
C: C. In a subsequent study, the products that consumers perceived as having a lower performance risk were priced higher than the highest priced products in the previous research.
D: D. None of the consumers involved in this research had ever before bought products from the manufacturers involved in the research.
E: E. Researchers found that the higher the source credibility for a product, the more consumers were willing to pay for it.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation The question depends on evaluating the reasoning behind the conclusion of some research and deciding which evidence would weaken that conclusion. The research concludes that higher prices reduce consumers’ perception of performance risk associated with a particular product. This conclusion involves a claim of cause and effect, so evidence showing that higher prices do not cause that effect would weaken the argument.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If lowering prices has no effect on consumers’ perception of performance risk, the conclusion of the research is called into question.
Explanation B: B. Without further information, an observed correlation between quality of advertising and perceived performance risk would hardly be relevant to the research conclusion about the effects of price. We are given no information about whether there is any significant correlation between advertising quality and price and no evidence that the correlation between advertising quality and perceptions of performance risk indicates a causal connection. Even if advertising quality caused perceptions of lower performance risk, this would be theoretically compatible with the conclusion about the effect of price; the studies concluded that higher prices cause perceptions of lower performance risk, not that they are the only thing that causes such perceptions.
Explanation C: C. This answer choice provides no basis for comparison among prices within the subsequent study. For all we can tell, the prices that correlated with higher perceived performance risk in the subsequent study may have been lower than those that correlated with lower perceived risk. In that case, the subsequent study would tend to strengthen, not weaken, the conclusion drawn from the earlier research.
Explanation D: D. This indirectly suggests one type of reasoning to consider in checking whether the conclusion is well-founded, but its relevance is only remote. If the research involved only people who had never before bought products from the manufacturers involved in the research, this would raise the question of whether the sample might have been unrepresentative of consumers in general. However, we are given no reason to suppose that consumers who had previously bought from the manufacturers might be affected differently from the other group by differences in price.
Explanation E: E. Credibility of the source of advertisements is discussed as a separate issue in the second paragraph. We are given no information about how source credibility might relate to price or about how the prices that consumers are willing to pay might relate to the advertised prices of the products. Therefore, the relevance of this answer choice to the conclusion is only conjectural at best.

### Passage:
Historians remain divided over the role of banks in facilitating economic growth in the United States in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Some scholars contend that banks played a minor role in the nation’s growing economy. Financial institutions, they argue, appeared only after the economy had begun to develop, and once organized, followed conservative lending practices, providing aid to established commercial enterprises but shunning those, such as manufacturing and transportation projects, that were more uncertain and capital-intensive (i.e., requiring greater expenditures in the form of capital than in labor).  A growing number of historians argue, in contrast, that banks were crucial in transforming the early national economy. When state legislatures began granting more bank charters in the 1790s and early 1800s, the supply of credit rose accordingly. Unlike the earliest banks, which had primarily provided short-term loans to well-connected merchants, the banks of the early nineteenth century issued credit widely. As Paul Gilje asserts, the expansion and democratization of credit in the early nineteenth century became the driving force of the American economy, as banks began furnishing large amounts of capital to transportation and industrial enterprises. The exception, such historians argue, was in the South; here, the overwhelmingly agrarian nature of the economy generated outright opposition to banks, which were seen as monopolistic institutions controlled by an elite group of planters.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. compare the economic role played by southern banks with the economic role played by banks in the rest of the United States during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
B: B. reevaluate a conventional interpretation of the role played by banks in the American economy during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
C: C. present different interpretations of the role played by banks in the American economy during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
D: D. analyze how the increasing number of banks in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries affected the American economy
E: E. examine how scholarly opinion regarding the role played by banks in the American economy during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries has changed over time

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea Answering this question correctly depends on understanding the passage as a whole. The passage describes two contrasting views about the role banks played in the economic growth of the United States around the turn of the nineteenth century. The first paragraph describes the view that banks played only a small role. The second paragraph describes the contrasting view that banks played a critical role.
Explanation A: A. The mention of banks in the South is a small part of a larger discussion about the role of banks in the country as a whole.
Explanation B: B. The passage describes two major views held by historians; it does not reevaluate either of those views.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage describes two different views about the role that banks played in America’s growing economy.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not analyze any aspect of the relationship between the increasing number of banks and the economy. It alludes to the increase in numbers only within a broader description of two contrasting views about how banks affected the economy.
Explanation E: E. Although the passage does indicate that a growing number of historians hold one of the two views it describes, the primary purpose of the passage is not to examine how scholarly opinion has changed, but rather to describe in some detail those two views.

The exception, such historians argue, was in the South; here, the overwhelmingly agrarian nature of the economy generated outright opposition to banks, which were seen as monopolistic institutions controlled by an elite group of planters.

### Question:
The passage suggests that the scholars mentioned in line 4 would argue that the reason banks tended not to fund manufacturing and transportation projects in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was that
A: A. these projects, being well established and well capitalized, did not need substantial long- term financing from banks
B: B. these projects entailed a level of risk that was too great for banks’ conservative lending practices
C: C. banks preferred to invest in other, more speculative projects that offered the potential for higher returns
D: D. bank managers believed that these projects would be unlikely to contribute significantly to economic growth in the new country
E: E. bank managers believed funding these projects would result in credit being extended to too many borrowers

### Response:
<think>
Inference The question asks about information implied by the passage. According to the scholars’ view described in the first paragraph, banks followed conservative lending practices: they shunned projects that were uncertain and that required substantial investments in capital. It follows that, according to those scholars, the reason banks chose not to fund certain projects was that the projects entailed too great a risk.
Explanation A: A. The passage indicates that manufacturing and transportation projects were less well established than those the banks preferred to fund, not more so.
Explanation B: B. Correct. Because the projects were uncertain and required a great deal of capital, banks considered them too risky.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate that the scholars argue that banks preferred to invest in more speculative projects. In fact, it suggests that they argue the opposite: the banks avoided investing not only in manufacturing and transportation projects but also in any projects that were at least as risky as those.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not mention bank managers’ beliefs about economic growth, and it does not provide any basis for inferring that the scholars in question held any particular views regarding such beliefs.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not mention, or provide a basis for inferences about, bank managers’ concerns about numbers of borrowers.

### Instruction:
You are a GMAT expert specializing in Reading Comprehension. Your task is to carefully read the provided passage and answer the question that follows. Focus on understanding the main idea, supporting details, author's purpose, and inferences that can be drawn from the passage. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Historians remain divided over the role of banks in facilitating economic growth in the United States in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Some scholars contend that banks played a minor role in the nation’s growing economy. Financial institutions, they argue, appeared only after the economy had begun to develop, and once organized, followed conservative lending practices, providing aid to established commercial enterprises but shunning those, such as manufacturing and transportation projects, that were more uncertain and capital-intensive (i.e., requiring greater expenditures in the form of capital than in labor).  A growing number of historians argue, in contrast, that banks were crucial in transforming the early national economy. When state legislatures began granting more bank charters in the 1790s and early 1800s, the supply of credit rose accordingly. Unlike the earliest banks, which had primarily provided short-term loans to well-connected merchants, the banks of the early nineteenth century issued credit widely. As Paul Gilje asserts, the expansion and democratization of credit in the early nineteenth century became the driving force of the American economy, as banks began furnishing large amounts of capital to transportation and industrial enterprises. The exception, such historians argue, was in the South; here, the overwhelmingly agrarian nature of the economy generated outright opposition to banks, which were seen as monopolistic institutions controlled by an elite group of planters.

### Question:
The passage suggests that Paul Gilje would be most likely to agree with which of the following claims about the lending practices of the “earliest banks” (see line 21)?
A: A. These lending practices were unlikely to generate substantial profits for banks.
B: B. These lending practices only benefited a narrow sector of the economy.
C: C. The restrictive nature of these lending practices generated significant opposition outside of the South.
D: D. The restrictive nature of these lending practices forced state legislatures to begin granting more bank charters by the early nineteenth century.
E: E. These lending practices were likely to be criticized by economic elites as being overly restrictive.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question asks about conclusions that can be logically inferred from information provided in the passage. According to the second paragraph, Paul Gilje believes that a driving force in American economic growth in the early nineteenth century was banks’ lending to a larger and more diverse group of borrowers. The question asks what this would imply about Gilje’s view toward earlier banks—which, the passage explains, offered credit only to well-connected merchants.
Explanation A: A. The profitability of banks’ lending practices is not at issue in the discussion.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage says that the earliest banks had primarily made loans only to a narrow sector—well-connected merchants—and that they began lending more broadly in the early nineteenth century. It then cites Gilje’s view to corroborate and explicate this claim. This strongly suggests that Gilje agrees with the claim.
Explanation C: C. Opposition to the earliest banks is not mentioned or alluded to in the discussion.
Explanation D: D. The passage provides no basis for inferring that Gilje held any particular view as to why legislatures began granting more bank charters.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not mention or provide a basis for inference about the views of economic elites regarding the lending practices of the earliest banks in the United States. It thus provides no basis for inferring that Gilje would have any particular opinion on this topic.

The exception, such historians argue, was in the South; here, the overwhelmingly agrarian nature of the economy generated outright opposition to banks, which were seen as monopolistic institutions controlled by an elite group of planters.

### Question:
The passage suggests that the opposition to banks in the South in the early nineteenth century stemmed in part from the perception that banks
A: A. did not benefit more than a small minority of the people
B: B. did not support the interests of elite planters
C: C. were too closely tied to transportation and industrial interests
D: D. were unwilling to issue the long-term loans required by agrarian interests
E: E. were too willing to lend credit widely

### Response:
<think>
Inference The question asks about statements that can be inferred from information provided in the passage. The second paragraph explains that people who opposed banks in the South saw them as monopolies controlled by elite planters. This would imply that those who opposed banks believed that most people in the South did not benefit from them.
Explanation A: A. Correct. Since people opposed the banks on the grounds that they were monopolies controlled by an elite group of planters, they likely thought banks did not benefit most of the population.
Explanation B: B. The passage states that the overwhelmingly agrarian nature of the economy generated outright opposition to banks, which were seen as monopolistic institutions controlled by an elite group of planters. That statement implies that people believed the banks did serve the interests of elite planters, the opposite of what this answer choice states.
Explanation C: C. The passage indicates that people believed banks in the South were tied to planters, not to transportation and industrial interests.
Explanation D: D. Southern banks’ willingness to provide long-term loans is not discussed or alluded to in the passage.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not imply that anyone believed banks in the South were willing to lend credit widely. Since people believed the banks were controlled by the elite, they more likely thought banks were unwilling to lend credit widely.

### Passage:
In recent years, Western business managers have been heeding the exhortations of business journalists and academics to move their companies toward long-term, collaborative “strategic partnerships” with their external business partners (e.g., suppliers). The experts’ advice comes as a natural reaction to numerous studies conducted during the past decade that compared Japanese production and supply practices with those of the rest of the world. The link between the success of a certain well-known Japanese automaker and its effective management of its suppliers, for example, has led to an unquestioning belief within Western management circles in the value of strategic partnerships. Indeed, in the automobile sector all three United States manufacturers and most of their European competitors have launched programs to reduce their total number of suppliers and move toward having strategic partnerships with a few.  However, new research concerning supplier relationships in various industries demonstrates that the widespread assumption of Western managers and business consultants that Japanese firms manage their suppliers primarily through strategic partnerships is unjustified. Not only do Japanese firms appear to conduct a far smaller proportion of their business through strategic partnerships than is commonly believed, but they also make extensive use of “market-exchange” relationships, in which either party can turn to the marketplace and shift to different business partners at will, a practice usually associated with Western manufacturers.

### Question:
The passage is primarily concerned with
A: A. examining economic factors that may have contributed to the success of certain Japanese companies
B: B. discussing the relative merits of strategic partnerships as compared with those of market-exchange relationships
C: C. challenging the validity of a widely held assumption about how Japanese firms operate
D: D. explaining why Western companies have been slow to adopt a particular practice favored by Japanese companies
E: E. pointing out certain differences between Japanese and Western supplier relationships

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question asks for an assessment of what the passage as a whole is doing. The passage discusses how Western business managers have been following the advice of academics and journalists to pursue strategic partnerships with their suppliers. The advice is based on studies comparing Japanese production and supply practices with those of the rest of the world. Newer research, however, indicates that Japanese practices actually differ from those indicated in the earlier studies and are not significantly different from practices associated with Western manufacturers.
Explanation A: A. The passage is not primarily concerned with economic factors contributing to the success of Japanese companies, but rather with whether Japanese relationships with suppliers conform to the practices recently adopted by Western business manufacturers.
Explanation B: B. Although the passage discusses strategic partnerships and market-exchange relationships, it does not discuss their relative merits.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage does question the view promoted by several studies regarding the relationship Japanese firms have with their suppliers.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not indicate that Western companies have been slow to adopt any particular practice favored by Japanese companies.
Explanation E: E. Rather than pointing out differences between Japanese and Western supplier relationships, it actually suggests that they are more similar than generally realized.

Supporting Idea To answer this question, you must identify what evidence is cited in the passage regarding the author’s claim that new research casts doubt on the widespread view that Japanese firms primarily manage their supplier relationships through strategic partnerships. To support this claim regarding the new research, the author points out that Japanese firms make extensive use of “market-exchange” relationships, which are alternatives to the strategic relationships discussed in the preceding paragraph.
Explanation A: A. This is the belief that the author claims that the new research casts doubt on, so it would not make sense for the author to cite this as evidence for the author’s claim.
Explanation B: B. This is cited as a result of the belief that the author claims the new research casts doubt on, not as evidence for the author’s claim.
Explanation C: C. The new research undermines the basis of the advice referred to here—advice that the Western automobile manufacturers heed—so it would make little sense for the author to cite this as evidence in support of the author’s claim about the new research.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage does cite this prevalence as evidence for the author’s claim that the new research casts doubt on the widely held view about Japanese firms.
Explanation E: E. Citing this firm’s success would tend to support the widespread view about Japanese firms, not undermine that view.

D Main Idea Summary The passage primarily addresses a question about what a company should do when it has acquired another company and needs to lay off some of the upper management team of the acquired company. Is the acquisition more likely to be successful if top executives with longer experience in the acquired company are retained or if those with less experience in the company are retained? The passage introduces the topic by way of a related discussion about which top executive positions should be retained. It then discusses some theoretical considerations in favor of two opposing views about whether longer-tenured executives or shorter-tenured executives should be retained. The final paragraph describes a study designed to help decide the issue. The main idea of the passage is that this study supports the view that acquisitions are more likely to succeed if longer-tenured top executives in the acquired company are retained than if shorter- tenured top executives are retained."

### Passage:
In an effort to explain why business acquisitions often fail, scholars have begun to focus on the role of top executives of acquired companies. Acquired companies that retain their top executives tend to have more successful outcomes than those that do not. Furthermore, existing research suggests that retaining the highest-level top executives, such as the CEO (chief executive officer) and COO (chief operating officer), is related more positively to postacquisition success than retaining lower-ranked top executives. However, this explanation, while insightful, suffers from two limitations. First, the focus on positional rank does not recognize the variation in length of service that may exist in top executive posts across companies, nor does it address which particular top executives (with respect to length of service) should be retained to achieve a successful acquisition outcome. Second, the relationship between retained top executives and acquisition outcomes offered by existing research is subject to opposing theoretical explanations related to length of service. The resource-based view (RBV) suggests that keeping acquired company top executives with longer organizational tenure would lead to more successful outcomes, as those executives have idiosyncratic and nontransferable knowledge of the acquired company that would be valuable for the effective implementation of the acquisition. The opposing position, offered by the upper echelons perspective (UEP), suggests that retaining top executives having short organizational tenure would lead to more successful outcomes, as they would have the adaptability to manage most effectively during the uncertainty of the acquisition process.  Responding to these limitations, Bergh conducted a study of executive retention and acquisition outcome that focused on the organizational tenure of retained company top executives in 104 acquisitions, followed over 5 years. Bergh considered the acquisition successful if the acquired company was retained and unsuccessful if it was divested. Bergh’s findings support the RBV position. Apparently, the benefits of long organizational tenure lead to more successful outcomes than the benefits of short organizational tenure. While longer-tenured top executives may have trouble adapting to change, it appears that their perspectives and knowledge bases offer unique value after the acquisition. Although from the UEP position it seems sensible to retain less-tenured executives and allow more-tenured ones to leave, such a strategy appears to lower the probability of acquisition success.

### Question:
According to the passage, the research mentioned in line 6 suggests which of the following about lower-ranked top executives and postacquisition success?
A: A. Given that these executives are unlikely to contribute to postacquisition success, little effort should be spent trying to retain them.
B: B. The shorter their length of service, the less likely it is that these executives will play a significant role in postacquisition success.
C: C. These executives are less important to postacquisition success than are more highly ranked top executives.
D: D. If they have long tenures, these executives may prove to be as important to postacquisition success as are more highly ranked top executives.
E: E. Postacquisition success is unlikely if these executives are retained.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The question asks about information provided by the passage. According to the third sentence, research suggests that retaining the highest-level top executives in an acquisition is more strongly associated with success than retaining lower-ranked top executives—which suggests, in turn, that lower-ranked top executives are less important than top-level executives to postacquisition success, though it does not suggest that they are unimportant to such success.
Explanation A: A. The research indicates that lower-ranked top executives are less strongly associated with success than are higher-ranked executives but does not provide advice about retention efforts.
Explanation B: B. The research mentioned in the third sentence does not consider length of service.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The research indicates that lower-ranked top executives are less strongly associated with postacquisition success than are the highest-ranked executives.
Explanation D: D. The research mentioned in the third sentence does not consider length of service.
Explanation E: E. The research suggests that lower-ranked top executives are less strongly associated with postacquisition success but does not suggest that they decrease the likelihood of success.

Evaluation This question requires analysis of the reasoning underlying one of the two explanations described in the passage. The resource-based view (RBV) holds that retaining high-level executives with long tenure will contribute to success because those people have important company-specific knowledge. This view rests on the assumption that company-specific knowledge is valuable to postacquisition success.
Explanation A: A. In RBV, executives with long tenure are valuable not specifically for their managerial skills but for their knowledge about the acquired company. The passage does not restrict to five years the period in which this knowledge is gained.
Explanation B: B. Correct. RBV values executives’ knowledge of the acquired company and is based on the belief that company-specific knowledge is valuable for postacquisition success.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate that RBV claims that executives’ company-specific knowledge is generally undervalued. But the passage does indicate that RBV regards such knowledge as valuable to postacquisition success.
Explanation D: D. In RBV, executives with long tenure are valuable not for their ability to adapt to change but for their knowledge about the acquired company.
Explanation E: E. RBV does not suggest that short-tenured executives impede postacquisition success, only that they are less important to success than the highest-ranked executives.

### Passage:
In an effort to explain why business acquisitions often fail, scholars have begun to focus on the role of top executives of acquired companies. Acquired companies that retain their top executives tend to have more successful outcomes than those that do not. Furthermore, existing research suggests that retaining the highest-level top executives, such as the CEO (chief executive officer) and COO (chief operating officer), is related more positively to postacquisition success than retaining lower-ranked top executives. However, this explanation, while insightful, suffers from two limitations. First, the focus on positional rank does not recognize the variation in length of service that may exist in top executive posts across companies, nor does it address which particular top executives (with respect to length of service) should be retained to achieve a successful acquisition outcome. Second, the relationship between retained top executives and acquisition outcomes offered by existing research is subject to opposing theoretical explanations related to length of service. The resource-based view (RBV) suggests that keeping acquired company top executives with longer organizational tenure would lead to more successful outcomes, as those executives have idiosyncratic and nontransferable knowledge of the acquired company that would be valuable for the effective implementation of the acquisition. The opposing position, offered by the upper echelons perspective (UEP), suggests that retaining top executives having short organizational tenure would lead to more successful outcomes, as they would have the adaptability to manage most effectively during the uncertainty of the acquisition process.  Responding to these limitations, Bergh conducted a study of executive retention and acquisition outcome that focused on the organizational tenure of retained company top executives in 104 acquisitions, followed over 5 years. Bergh considered the acquisition successful if the acquired company was retained and unsuccessful if it was divested. Bergh’s findings support the RBV position. Apparently, the benefits of long organizational tenure lead to more successful outcomes than the benefits of short organizational tenure. While longer-tenured top executives may have trouble adapting to change, it appears that their perspectives and knowledge bases offer unique value after the acquisition. Although from the UEP position it seems sensible to retain less-tenured executives and allow more-tenured ones to leave, such a strategy appears to lower the probability of acquisition success.

### Question:
The passage suggests that Bergh and a proponent of the upper echelons perspective would be most likely to disagree over which of the following?
A: A. Whether there is a positive correlation between short organizational tenure and managerial adaptability
B: B. Whether there is a positive correlation between long organizational tenure and the acquisition of idiosyncratic and nontransferable knowledge
C: C. Whether adaptability is a useful trait for an executive who is managing an acquisition process
D: D. Whether retaining less-tenured top executives of an acquired company is an optimal strategy for achieving postacquisition success
E: E. Whether retaining highest-level top executives of acquired companies is more important than retaining lower-ranked top executives

### Response:
<think>
Inference The question asks about conclusions that can reasonably be drawn from the information provided in the passage. Bergh’s study supports the resource-based view (RBV), which suggests that top executives with long tenure are more valuable to postacquisition success than other executives. The upper echelons perspective (UEP), in contrast, suggests that top executives with shorter tenure are more valuable to postacquisition success. Thus, Bergh and a proponent of UEP would likely disagree about whether long- or short-tenured top executives are more valuable to a positive outcome in a postacquisition situation.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not provide sufficiently specific information about statistical relationships to determine whether Bergh and proponents of UEP would agree or disagree about whether there is such a positive correlation.
Explanation B: B. There is a weak suggestion in the passage that Bergh believes such a positive correlation exists, but there is no indication that a proponent of UEP would question such a correlation.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate that Bergh would disagree with proponents of UEP that adaptability is a valuable trait in an executive who is managing an acquisition.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage suggests that proponents of UEP believe that retaining less-tenured top executives during and after an acquisition is a better strategy, while Bergh believes that retaining longer-tenured top executives is better.
Explanation E: E. The passage suggests that Bergh and proponents of UEP agree that retaining the highest- level top executives is more important to postacquisition success than is retaining lower- ranked top executives.

### Question:
According to the passage, prior to Bergh’s study, research on the role of top executives of acquired companies in business acquisition success was limited in which of the following ways?
A: A. It did not address how the organizational tenure of top executives affects postacquisition success.
B: B. It did not address why some companies have longer-tenured CEOs than others.
C: C. It did not consider strategies for retaining long-tenured top executives of acquired companies.
D: D. It failed to differentiate between the contribution of highest-level top executives to postacquisition success and that of lower-ranked top executives.
E: E. It underestimated the potential contribution that lower-level top executives can make to postacquisition success.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question asks about information explicitly provided in the passage. The first paragraph summarizes research indicating that retaining highest-level top executives during and after an acquisition is more strongly associated with successful outcomes than retaining lower-ranking top executives. The paragraph then states that this research has limitations, including failing to take into account how long the highest-ranking executives have worked for the company. The second paragraph explains that Bergh’s study responds to those limitations by analyzing the role of tenure (length of service in the organization).
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage indicates that the research about the role of highest-level executives in acquisitions is limited by its failure to consider tenure.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not portray the failure of the research to address this as a limitation of the research in question.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not portray the failure of the research to consider this as a limitation of the research in question.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates that the research does, in fact, differentiate between the respective contributions of these two groups of top executives.
Explanation E: E. Undervaluing the contributions of lower-level top executives is not one of the limitations mentioned in the passage.

A Main Idea Summary The passage is primarily concerned with Marcus Garvey’s role in the African American revitalization movement of the early twentieth century. The passage’s first paragraph states that the return of African American soldiers from the First World War created an ideal constituency for Garvey’s message of pride and unity among African Americans. The second paragraph describes the disillusionment of these soldiers upon their return and discusses Anthony F. C. Wallace’s idea that the tension between a culture’s expectations and reality can inspire a revitalization movement. The final paragraph argues that Garvey did not create the consciousness on which he built his movement, but merely gave it its political expression."

### Passage:
When Jamaican-born social activist Marcus Garvey came to the United States in 1916, he arrived at precisely the right historical moment. What made the moment right was the return of African American soldiers from the First World War in 1918, which created an ideal constituency for someone with Garvey’s message of unity, pride, and improved conditions for African American communities.  Hoping to participate in the traditional American ethos of individual success, many African American people entered the armed forces with enthusiasm, only to find themselves segregated from white troops and subjected to numerous indignities. They returned to a United States that was as segregated as it had been before the war. Considering similar experiences, anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace has argued that when a perceptible gap arises between a culture’s expectations and the reality of that culture, the resulting tension can inspire a revitalization movement: an organized, conscious effort to construct a culture that fulfills longstanding expectations.  Some scholars have argued that Garvey created the consciousness from which he built, in the 1920s, the largest revitalization movement in African American history. But such an argument only tends to obscure the consciousness of identity, strength, and sense of history that already existed in the African American community. Garvey did not create this consciousness; rather, he gave this consciousness its political expression.

### Question:
According to the passage, which of the following contributed to Marcus Garvey’s success?
A: A. He introduced cultural and historical consciousness to the African American community.
B: B. He believed enthusiastically in the traditional American success ethos.
C: C. His audience had already formed a consciousness that made it receptive to his message.
D: D. His message appealed to critics of African American support for United States military involvement in the First World War.
E: E. He supported the movement to protest segregation that had emerged prior to his arrival in the United States.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea To answer this question, find what the passage states explicitly about how Marcus Garvey achieved his success. The passage begins by stating that Garvey arrived at the right time: that returning African American soldiers were primed to receive what he had to say about the African American community. These soldiers already held strong beliefs about their rights to opportunities for success; the passage concludes that the divide between the soldiers’ expectations and their experiences led to Garvey’s success.
Explanation A: A. The passage states that African American people were in possession of a strong cultural and historical consciousness prior to Garvey’s arrival in the United States.
Explanation B: B. The passage attributes belief in the traditional American success ethos to African American people who joined the armed forces; it does not mention Garvey’s beliefs on this subject.
Explanation C: C. Correct. African American soldiers who had experienced segregation during the First World War were ready to hear what Garvey had to say.
Explanation D: D. Critics of African American support for United States involvement in the First World War are not mentioned in the passage.
Explanation E: E. While Garvey most likely would have supported a movement to protest segregation, such a movement is not discussed in the passage.

Garvey did not create this consciousness; rather, he gave this consciousness its political expression.

### Question:
The passage suggests that many African American people responded to their experiences in the armed forces in which of the following ways?
A: A. They maintained as civilians their enthusiastic allegiance to the armed forces.
B: B. They questioned United States involvement in the First World War.
C: C. They joined political organizations to protest the segregation of African American troops and the indignities they suffered in the military.
D: D. They became aware of the gap between their expectations and the realities of American culture.
E: E. They repudiated Garvey’s message of pride and unity.

### Response:
<think>
Inference According to the passage, African Americans enthusiastically joined the armed services but were confronted with continued segregation, both in the military and when they returned home. The passage does not explicitly state their response to these experiences, but a response can be inferred. The second paragraph refers to anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace, who argued that a revitalization movement may be brought about by the perception of a gap between expectations and reality, and such a revitalization did occur in African American communities following the First World War; thus, many African American people may have become aware of a gap such as Wallace described.
Explanation A: A. The passage states that African American troops experienced segregation and other indignities while in the military; these experiences could reasonably be inferred to have dampened their enthusiasm for the armed forces. Regardless, the passage does not suggest an enthusiastic allegiance.
Explanation B: B. The passage describes African American people’s enthusiasm about joining the military. Although they experienced segregation and other indignities while in the military, the passage does not suggest that their opinion about involvement in the war changed.
Explanation C: C. While African American troops may have joined political organizations, the passage does not provide any actual evidence of this having occurred.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The fact that, as the passage states, a revitalization movement occurred in the African American community following the First World War suggests that the returning soldiers did become aware of the gap between their expectations of an improved situation with regard to segregation and the reality of continued segregation in the United States.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not suggest that African American troops repudiated Garvey’s message. On the contrary, it states that Garvey built the largest revitalization movement in African American history. This suggests that the members of the African American community, including the returning soldiers, were extremely receptive to Garvey’s message.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that the “scholars” mentioned in line 24 believe which of the following to be true?
A: A. Revitalization resulted from the political activism of returning African American soldiers following the First World War.
B: B. Marcus Garvey had to change a number of prevailing attitudes in order for his mass movement to find a foothold in the United States.
C: C. The prevailing sensibility of the African American community provided the foundation of Marcus Garvey’s political appeal.
D: D. Marcus Garvey hoped to revitalize consciousness of cultural and historical identity in the African American community.
E: E. The goal of the mass movement that Marcus Garvey helped bring into being was to build on the pride and unity among African Americans.

### Response:
<think>
Inference To determine what it is logical to infer regarding the scholars discussed in the third paragraph, look at the context in which they are mentioned. According to the passage, these scholars argue that Garvey was responsible for creating a particular consciousness within the African American community, a consciousness that the passage identifies as identity, strength, and [a] sense of history. Unlike the passage author, these scholars believe strongly in Garvey’s responsibility for this consciousness, so they would most likely reject any suggestion that it existed prior to his arrival and activism.
Explanation A: A. According to the passage, the scholars believe that Garvey was responsible for the creation of the consciousness that led to revitalization, which suggests that revitalization resulted from Garvey’s activism, not soldiers’ activism.
Explanation B: B. Correct. According to the passage, the scholars believe that Garvey created the consciousness that led to his revitalization movement. This suggests that he had to change prevailing attitudes in order to foster this new consciousness.
Explanation C: C. According to the passage, the scholars believe that Garvey created a new consciousness in the African American community; thus, the prevailing sensibility could not have provided a foundation for his appeal.
Explanation D: D. According to the passage, the scholars believe that Garvey built his revitalization movement on a new consciousness of cultural and historical identity, not a previously existing one.
Explanation E: E. According to the passage, the scholars’ position is that Garvey’s movement was built on a new sense of pride and unity that he provided, and that that sense did not precede Garvey’s work.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question depends on identifying what the passage states directly about African American people’s reasons for joining the armed forces. The reason offered by the passage is that the African American people who entered the armed forces did so because they were hoping to participate in the traditional American ethos of individual success.
Explanation A: A. Although this is a plausible reason for entering the armed forces, the passage does not discuss economic conditions.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage states that African American people who joined the armed forces during the First World War wanted to achieve individual success.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not discuss African American people’s loyalty to the United States.
Explanation D: D. The passage states that African American troops experienced segregation, but it does not suggest that they had hoped their joining the military would promote desegregation.
Explanation E: E. The passage suggests that African American troops did not become aware of Marcus Garvey’s political vision until after they returned from the First World War.

### Passage:
Arboria is floundering in the global marketplace, incurring devastating losses in market position and profits. The problem is not Arboria’s products but Arboria’s trade policy. Arboria faces the prospect of continuing economic loss until Arborian business and political leaders recognize the fundamental differences between Arborian and foreign economic systems. Today the key trade issue is not free trade versus protectionism but diminishing trade versus expanding trade.  Arboria is operating with an obsolete trade policy, an artifact of the mid-1940s when Arboria and Whorfland dominated the global economy, tariffs were the principal obstacle to trade, and Arborian supremacy was uncontested in virtually all industries. In the intervening decades, economic circumstances have shifted radically. Arborian trade policy has not.  Today, Arboria’s trade policy seems paralyzed by the relentless conflict between proponents of “free” and “fair” trade. The free traders argue that Arborian markets should be open, and the movement of goods and services across national borders unrestrained. The fair traders assert that access to Arborian markets should be restricted until Arborian businesses are granted equal access to foreign markets. They contend that free trade is impossible while other nations erect barriers to Arborian exports.  Both are correct: fair trade requires equal access and equal access leads to free trade. But both sides base their positions on the same two outdated premises: 1. Global commerce is conducted under the terms of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  and dominated by Arboria and similar economic  systems abroad. 2. Multilateral negotiations are the most effective way  to resolve pressing trade issues.  Both assumptions are wrong. The 40-year-old GATT now covers less than 7 percent of global commerce. World trade is no longer dominated by the freetrade economies; nearly 75 percent is conducted by economic systems operating with principles at odds with those of Arboria. Forging a multilateral trade policy consensus among so many diverse economic systems has become virtually impossible. And while multilateral talks drag on, Arboria misses opportunities for trade expansion.

### Question:
Which of the following best states the difference between free trade and fair trade, as explained in the passage?
A: A. Free trade requires no trade tariffs whatsoever, whereas fair trade assumes multilateral agreement on tariffs for goods of equal worth.
B: B. Free trade is based on the unrestricted movement of goods across all national boundaries, whereas fair trade is based on a nation’s restriction of commerce with each nation that erects trade barriers to the first nation’s exports.
C: C. The trade policies of countries like Arboria are based on the principles of free trade, whereas the trade policies of other types of world economies are based on fair trade.
D: D. Free-trade nations negotiate individual trade agreements with each of their trading partners, whereas fair-trade nations conduct multilateral trade negotiations.
E: E. Free trade assumes a constant level of global commerce, whereas fair trade promotes a steady expansion of international trade.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question requires you to understand how the passage explains the difference between free trade and fair trade. The passage discusses international trade as viewed from the perspective of the nation of Arboria. The distinction between free trade and fair trade is discussed in the third paragraph. Free trade between two countries is understood as free movement of goods in each direction across countries’ borders. From the Arborian perspective, fair trade is understood as mutually beneficial trading arrangements, where access to the Arborian market is granted only to nations that allow Arborian exports equal access to their own markets.
Explanation A: A. The distinction between free trade and fair trade in the passage does not hinge on the absence or presence of tariffs in a trading regime, even though the passage implies that asymmetric application of tariffs would render a trading regime unfair.
Explanation B: B. Correct. As explained above, free trade implies open access to markets; fair trade implies that each of any two trading partner nations should allow the same level of access for imports from the other nation.
Explanation C: C. Whether true or false, this is a claim of a factual kind and does not provide anything resembling a definition of the two terms, free trade and fair trade. The passage suggests that Arboria has a free-trade economy and many other nations do not.
Explanation D: D. The passage tells us that both the free-trade advocates and the fair-trade advocates base their positions, in part, on the idea that multilateral negotiations are the most effective way of resolving pressing trade issues.
Explanation E: E. The passage suggests that free trade without fair trade would hinder the expansion of trade (especially Arborian trade) and that fair trade would eventually lead to free trade. But the passage also suggests that international trade between two countries can be simultaneously free and fair. As presented in the passage, the distinction between the two aspects of trade does not hinge on whether the regime promotes a steady expansion of international trade.

D: D. Arborian reliance on multilateral trade negotiations, while appropriate in the past, is inadequate for today’s global marketplace.
E: E. The principles of multilateral trade negotiations are incompatible with current Arborian foreign trade policy.

### Response:
<think>
Inference Answering this question requires you to infer from the given information what claim about multilateral trade negotiations the author would most likely agree with. According to the passage, the advocates of free trade and the advocates of fair trade both assume that multilateral negotiations are the most effective way to resolve trading issues. But the passage claims that this assumption is wrong and outdated for current trading conditions. The passage argues that nearly 75 percent of trade is conducted by widely divergent economic systems in countries not subscribing to the same trading principles as Arboria and that this makes negotiation of multilateral trade agreements virtually impossible.
Explanation A: A. As explained above, the author of the passage takes a position opposed to this.
Explanation B: B. According to the passage, it is virtually impossible to negotiate multilateral agreements with countries that do not accept the same trading principles as Arboria and that therefore may have differing notions of what makes trade fair.
Explanation C: C. The passage suggests that the assumption concerning multilateral trade negotiations had for 40 years been accepted by the free-trade countries that dominated world trade—as well as possibly by other trading countries.
Explanation D: D. Correct. As explained above, this is a part of the argument in the passage.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not argue that a principle concerning multilateral approaches in negotiating trade policy, long accepted by Arborian trading authorities, was incompatible with “current” foreign-trade policy. Rather, the passage suggests that that principle and the associated policy should be questioned and rejected, with a view to formulating a policy more relevant to current conditions.

### Passage:
Arboria is floundering in the global marketplace, incurring devastating losses in market position and profits. The problem is not Arboria’s products but Arboria’s trade policy. Arboria faces the prospect of continuing economic loss until Arborian business and political leaders recognize the fundamental differences between Arborian and foreign economic systems. Today the key trade issue is not free trade versus protectionism but diminishing trade versus expanding trade.  Arboria is operating with an obsolete trade policy, an artifact of the mid-1940s when Arboria and Whorfland dominated the global economy, tariffs were the principal obstacle to trade, and Arborian supremacy was uncontested in virtually all industries. In the intervening decades, economic circumstances have shifted radically. Arborian trade policy has not.  Today, Arboria’s trade policy seems paralyzed by the relentless conflict between proponents of “free” and “fair” trade. The free traders argue that Arborian markets should be open, and the movement of goods and services across national borders unrestrained. The fair traders assert that access to Arborian markets should be restricted until Arborian businesses are granted equal access to foreign markets. They contend that free trade is impossible while other nations erect barriers to Arborian exports.  Both are correct: fair trade requires equal access and equal access leads to free trade. But both sides base their positions on the same two outdated premises: 1. Global commerce is conducted under the terms of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  and dominated by Arboria and similar economic  systems abroad. 2. Multilateral negotiations are the most effective way  to resolve pressing trade issues.  Both assumptions are wrong. The 40-year-old GATT now covers less than 7 percent of global commerce. World trade is no longer dominated by the freetrade economies; nearly 75 percent is conducted by economic systems operating with principles at odds with those of Arboria. Forging a multilateral trade policy consensus among so many diverse economic systems has become virtually impossible. And while multilateral talks drag on, Arboria misses opportunities for trade expansion.

### Question:
Which of the following statements best summarizes the author’s opinion of “free traders” and “fair traders”?
A: A. The free and the fair traders’ continuing debate provides a healthy and effective forum for examining Arborian trade policy.
B: B. The proponents of fair trade are essentially correct, while those who advocate free trade are not.
C: C. The proponents of free trade are better able to deal with current economic problems than are the fair traders.
D: D. Neither the free nor the fair traders can come up with a workable trade policy because neither takes multilateral negotiations into account.
E: E. The proponents of both free and fair trade have based their positions on out-of-date premises that do not reflect current economic conditions.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question requires an understanding of what the author has to say about free traders and fair traders. The final paragraph of the passage states that both sides, i.e. the proponents of free trade and the proponents of fair trade, base their positions on two assumptions that, according to the passage, are outdated. The passage attributes this outdatedness to changes that have occurred in the composition of international trade.
Explanation A: A. The passage implies that the debate between the free traders and the fair traders is unlikely to make progress because of two outdated assumptions that both sides make.
Explanation B: B. The passage implies that fair trade ultimately leads to free trade. The passage implies that trade can be both free and fair.
Explanation C: C. The passage indicates that assumptions on which the free traders and the fair traders rely are incompatible with the current realities of international trade.
Explanation D: D. The passage argues that both free traders and fair traders wrongly assume that the best way to resolve trade issues is through the use of multilateral negotiations.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This is a claim that is central to the argument in the passage, as explained above.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The word mentions in the question is to be taken as meaning “explicitly states” (as opposed to implies or suggests), so this question requires that you recognize what is and is NOT explicitly stated in the passage regarding world trade in the mid-1940s. The passage states that Arboria and Whorfland dominated the global economy for a long period, but no longer do so. It also states that tariffs were the main obstacle to trade during the time of Arboria’s trade supremacy and that in most industries, Arboria had no close competitors. The passage neither states nor implies that at that time fair-trade economies dominated world trade.
Explanation A: A. The passage states that this was so in the mid-1940s.
Explanation B: B. This is stated in the passage.
Explanation C: C. The passage states that tariffs were the principal obstacle to trade.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage does NOT mention this; it neither states nor implies that in the mid- 1940s, fair-trade economies dominated world trade.

E: E. an example of an economic system whose principles differ from those of Arboria

### Response:

Evaluation This question concerns rhetorical techniques used in the passage, and we are asked to identify a technique that is NOT used.
Explanation A: A. The passage gives some statistical information about global commerce: e.g., 75 percent of world trade involves countries with divergent economic systems that differ from those of Arboria.
Explanation B: B. The passage defines free trade and fair trade.
Explanation C: C. The passage states that the supremacy of Arboria in most industries was for a long time uncontested.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates how the trade regime in which Arboria participates was established 40 years previously.
Explanation E: E. Correct. No individual economic system besides that of Whorfland—which has adopted the same trading principles as Arboria—is cited in the passage.

The author asserts which of the following about Arboria’s trade policy?
A: A. A dramatic revision of Arboria’s trade policy will be necessary unless Arborian manufacturers improve the quality of their goods.
B: B. The most crucial issue facing Arborian trade policy makers is that of free trade versus protectionism.
C: C. Arboria’s current trade policy was essentially developed during the 1940s and has changed little since that time.
D: D. Arboria’s trade policy is widely emulated throughout the world, to the extent that most international commerce is modeled on Arboria’s principles.
E: E. Arboria’s trade policy has evolved gradually over the last eighty years, constantly readjusting itself in response to shifts in global commerce.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question asks us to identify something stated in the passage—though not necessarily in the exact words given. We should look for the statement that is the most precise paraphrase of a statement made in the passage.
Explanation A: A. Although the passage indicates that some revision of Arborian trade policy is needed, the passage does not indicate that such a revision would be unnecessary if the quality of Arborian manufactures improved.
Explanation B: B. The passage states that Today the key trade issue is not free trade versus protectionism.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage states that the current trade policy is obsolete and an artifact of the mid-1940s, and adds that although economic circumstances have changed, Arborian trade policy has not.
Explanation D: D. The passage states that nearly 75 percent [of world trade] is conducted by economic systems operating with principles at odds with those of Arboria.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not state that this is so; in fact, it emphasizes the lack of change over the previous 40 years in Arborian trade policy and the absence of readjustment in response to significant changes in conditions affecting global trade.

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea We are asked here to select the phrase that most accurately identifies the topic that is the central theme of the passage. The discussion revolves around trade policy—specifically the way in which it has affected the interests of the nation of Arboria. In the course of exploring this central topic, several issues are touched on: the loss of Arborian dominance in global trade; the distinction between free trade and fair trade; the impact of GATT on the governance of global trade; and the percentage of total trade conducted by countries other than Arboria and Whorfland.
Explanation A: A. Illustrating something generally involves providing a specific example. But the passage gives no example to show how the Arborian trade position has declined relative to that of other countries.
Explanation B: B. The distinction between free trade and fair trade, as understood by the advocates of each of these, is explained in the broader context of considering Arborian trade policy. But the passage emphasizes the common assumptions relied on by both free traders and fair traders.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This is the theme of the passage, which advocates a reconsideration of Arborian trade policy and the longstanding assumptions on which it has been based. This central concern prompts the discussion of other relevant, but subsidiary, topics.
Explanation D: D. The individual terms of GATT are not examined or criticized in any detail, but the relevance of GATT to current global trade is minimized.
Explanation E: E. No such comparison is made, even though the divergence of economic systems involved in world trade is emphasized with a view to demonstrating the difficulty in negotiating multilateral trade deals and the obsolescence of the multilateral approach.

### Question:
The author implies that the main obstacle to a truly effective Arborian trade policy is the
A: A. weak position that Arboria currently holds in the global marketplace
B: B. inability of Arborian leaders to recognize that foreign economic systems are based on principles fundamentally different from their own
C: C. dominance of the supporters of free trade in the conflict between free-trade and fair- trade advocates
D: D. apparent inability of Arborian industries to produce goods that are competitive in the world market
E: E. protectionism that characterizes the foreign trade policies of so many of Arboria’s trade partners

### Response:
<think>
Inference Correctly answering this question requires you to infer from the given information what the main obstacle to an effective Arborian trade policy is. The correct response is to be found in the first paragraph of the passage, which contains the following sentence: Arboria faces the prospect of continuing economic loss until Arborian business and political leaders recognize the fundamental differences between Arborian and foreign economic systems. The phrase continuing economic loss indicates, from the author’s perspective, an ineffective trade policy. The until clause signifies that a necessary condition of improving the situation is a recognition by leaders that Arborian and foreign economic systems are fundamentally different. The final paragraph emphasizes that such differences exist: 75 percent [of world trade] is conducted by economic systems operating with principles at odds with those of Arboria.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not state or imply that Arboria has a “weak position” in global trade; rather, it emphasizes that Arboria can gain a much stronger position and misses opportunities for trade expansion.
Explanation B: B. Correct. See the detailed analysis given above.
Explanation C: C. The passage nowhere states or implies that the free-trade advocates are dominant in the dispute with fair-trade advocates, even though the passage suggests that developed economies such as Arboria and Whorfland have long practiced free trade and been dominant in global trade.
Explanation D: D. The passage neither states nor implies that the goods produced by Arborian industries are deficient in quality or are overpriced, but it does suggest that some countries that export to Arboria have trade barriers, such as tariffs, that impede importation of Arborian products.
Explanation E: E. The passage suggests that some trading partners of Arboria have trade barriers impeding imports from Arboria, but the passage asserts the following: Today the key trade issue is not free trade versus protectionism but diminishing trade versus expanding trade.

### Passage:
Biologists have advanced two theories to explain why schooling of fish occurs in so many fish species. Because schooling is particularly widespread among species of small fish, both theories assume that schooling offers the advantage of some protection from predators.  Proponents of theory A dispute the assumption that a school of thousands of fish is highly visible. Experiments have shown that any fish can be seen, even in very clear water, only within a sphere of 200 meters in diameter. When fish are in a compact group, the spheres of visibility overlap. Thus the chance of a predator finding the school is only slightly greater than the chance of the predator finding a single fish swimming alone. Schooling is advantageous to the individual fish because a predator’s chance of finding any particular fish swimming in the school is much smaller than its chance of finding at least one of the same group of fish if the fish were dispersed throughout an area.  However, critics of theory A point out that some fish form schools even in areas where predators are abundant and thus little possibility of escaping detection exists. They argue that the school continues to be of value to its members even after detection. They advocate theory B, the “confusion effect,” which can be explained in two different ways.  Sometimes, proponents argue, predators simply cannot decide which fish to attack. This indecision supposedly results from a predator’s preference for striking prey that is distinct from the rest of the school in appearance. In many schools the fish are almost identical in appearance, making it difficult for a predator to select one. The second explanation for the “confusion effect” has to do with the sensory confusion caused by a large number of prey moving around the predator. Even if the predator makes the decision to attack a particular fish, the movement of other prey in the school can be distracting. The predator’s difficulty can be compared to that of a tennis player trying to hit a tennis ball when two are approaching simultaneously.

### Question:
According to the passage, theory B states that which of the following is a factor that enables a schooling fish to escape predators?
A: A. The tendency of fish to form compact groups
B: B. The movement of other fish within the school
C: C. The inability of predators to detect schools
D: D. The ability of fish to hide behind one another in a school
E: E. The great speed with which a school can disperse

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question depends on understanding what the passage states about theory B, the “confusion effect.” One element of theory B is that predators may experience sensory confusion created by large numbers of moving fish in a school.
Explanation A: A. The compactness of groups of schooling fish is an element of theory A, not theory B.
Explanation B: B. Correct. It is the movement of schooling fish around a predator that creates sensory confusion in the predator; this movement may distract the predator and help to protect individual fish in the school.
Explanation C: C. According to the passage’s description of theory A, predators are actually slightly more likely to detect schools than they are to detect individual fish.
Explanation D: D. Theory B does not involve fish hiding behind one another, but rather moving around the predator.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not discuss the speed of dispersal of schools of fish.

A: A. fish hide from predators by forming schools
B: B. forming schools functions to protect fish from predators
C: C. schooling among fish differs from other protective behaviors
D: D. small fish are able to make rapid decisions
E: E. small fish are able to survive in an environment densely populated by large predators

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The passage states in its first paragraph that two theories were developed to explain why schooling occurs in so many fish species and that they both assume that schooling helps protect fish from predators.
Explanation A: A. While theory A involves an explanation of how schooling makes an individual fish less likely to be found by predators, theory B explains how schooling protects fish even when they are detected by predators.
Explanation B: B. Correct. Both theory A and theory B begin with the assumption that schooling provides protection from predators, and each theory offers a different explanation for how that protection occurs.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not discuss protective behaviors other than schooling.
Explanation D: D. The decision-making ability of predators, not schooling fish, is discussed in the passage; schooling is presented as an instinctive behavior.
Explanation E: E. The passage suggests that only theory B helps explain schooling behavior in environments where many predators, large or otherwise, are found, and that theory A explains schooling in areas where predators are not as abundant.

Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Biologists have advanced two theories to explain why schooling of fish occurs in so many fish species. Because schooling is particularly widespread among species of small fish, both theories assume that schooling offers the advantage of some protection from predators.  Proponents of theory A dispute the assumption that a school of thousands of fish is highly visible. Experiments have shown that any fish can be seen, even in very clear water, only within a sphere of 200 meters in diameter. When fish are in a compact group, the spheres of visibility overlap. Thus the chance of a predator finding the school is only slightly greater than the chance of the predator finding a single fish swimming alone. Schooling is advantageous to the individual fish because a predator’s chance of finding any particular fish swimming in the school is much smaller than its chance of finding at least one of the same group of fish if the fish were dispersed throughout an area.  However, critics of theory A point out that some fish form schools even in areas where predators are abundant and thus little possibility of escaping detection exists. They argue that the school continues to be of value to its members even after detection. They advocate theory B, the “confusion effect,” which can be explained in two different ways.  Sometimes, proponents argue, predators simply cannot decide which fish to attack. This indecision supposedly results from a predator’s preference for striking prey that is distinct from the rest of the school in appearance. In many schools the fish are almost identical in appearance, making it difficult for a predator to select one. The second explanation for the “confusion effect” has to do with the sensory confusion caused by a large number of prey moving around the predator. Even if the predator makes the decision to attack a particular fish, the movement of other prey in the school can be distracting. The predator’s difficulty can be compared to that of a tennis player trying to hit a tennis ball when two are approaching simultaneously.

### Question:
According to one explanation of the “confusion effect,” a fish that swims in a school will have greater advantages for survival if it
A: A. tends to be visible for no more than 200 meters
B: B. stays near either the front or the rear of a school
C: C. is part of a small school rather than a large school
D: D. is very similar in appearance to the other fish in the school
E: E. is medium-sized

### Response:
<think>
Inference The “confusion effect” is discussed in the third and fourth paragraphs. The first explanation of the “confusion effect” proposes that because predators prefer to select distinctive prey, they find it difficult to select one fish from among many that look the same.
Explanation A: A. The 200-meter visibility of fish is part of the explanation for theory A, not theory B (the “confusion effect”).
Explanation B: B. The location of an individual fish within a school is not discussed in the passage as being important to the “confusion effect.”
Explanation C: C. The size of a school of fish is not discussed as an element of the “confusion effect.”
Explanation D: D. Correct. Because predators, according to the “confusion effect,” prefer to select prey that is distinct from the rest of the school, a fish that is similar in appearance to the other fish in its school would most likely enjoy a survival advantage.
Explanation E: E. The size of a fish relative to the other fish in its school would most likely contribute to its ability to survive: that is, if it resembled other fish in size, it would be safer, based on what the passage says about the “confusion effect.” Furthermore, the passage gives no reason to think that merely being medium-sized would confer any advantage (unless the other fish were medium-sized as well).

Main Idea Determining the author’s primary concern depends on understanding the focus of the passage as a whole. The author presents two theories that purport to account for why fish, particularly small fish, tend to school, and explains the arguments of proponents of each theory.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The author discusses two theories—identified as theory A and theory B—that account for the tendency of fish to school.
Explanation B: B. The author is not concerned with different techniques in the passage.
Explanation C: C. The two theories of why fish school could be referred to as hypotheses, but the author is not primarily concerned with defending them; rather, the passage explains how each attempts to account for the phenomenon in question.
Explanation D: D. The author presents, rather than refutes, beliefs about why fish tend to school.
Explanation E: E. The author reveals no evidence, new or otherwise, in the passage. The passage is a general discussion of scientific opinions based on existing evidence.

### Passage:
In Winters v. United States (1908), the Supreme Court held that the right to use waters flowing through or adjacent to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation was reserved to American Indians by the treaty establishing the reservation. Although this treaty did not mention water rights, the Court ruled that the federal government, when it created the reservation, intended to deal fairly with American Indians by reserving for them the waters without which their lands would have been useless. Later decisions, citing Winters, established that courts can find federal rights to reserve water for particular purposes if (1) the land in question lies within an enclave under exclusive federal jurisdiction; (2) the land has been formally withdrawn from federal public lands—i.e., withdrawn from the stock of federal lands available for private use under federal land use laws—and set aside or reserved; and (3) the circumstances reveal the government intended to reserve water as well as land when establishing the reservation.  Some American Indian tribes have also established water rights through the courts based on their traditional diversion and use of certain waters prior to the United States’ acquisition of sovereignty. For example, the Rio Grande pueblos already existed when the United States acquired sovereignty over New Mexico in 1848. Although they at that time became part of the United States, the pueblo lands never formally constituted a part of federal public lands; in any event, no treaty, statute, or executive order has ever designated or withdrawn the pueblos from public lands as American Indian reservations. This fact, however, has not barred application of the Winters doctrine. What constitutes an American Indian reservation is a question of practice, not of legal definition, and the pueblos have always been treated as reservations by the United States. This pragmatic approach is buttressed by Arizona v. California (1963), wherein the Supreme Court indicated that the manner in which any type of federal reservation is created does not affect the application to it of the Winters doctrine. Therefore, the reserved water rights of Pueblo Indians have priority over other citizens’ water rights as of 1848, the year in which pueblos must be considered to have become reservations.

### Question:
According to the passage, which of the following was true of the treaty establishing the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation?
A: A. It was challenged in the Supreme Court a number of times.
B: B. It was rescinded by the federal government, an action that gave rise to the Winters case.
C: C. It cited American Indians’ traditional use of the land’s resources.
D: D. It failed to mention water rights to be enjoyed by the reservation’s inhabitants.
E: E. It was modified by the Supreme Court in Arizona v. California.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question depends on recognizing what the passage says about the treaty that established the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The passage indicates that the treaty does not mention water rights, but the federal government had intended, according to the Supreme Court, to reserve for the inhabitants of the reservation the waters that were essential to the usefulness of the land.
Explanation A: A. The passage does discuss Supreme Court cases, but it does not explicitly mention any challenges in the Supreme Court to the treaty.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not state that the federal government rescinded the treaty.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate that the treaty made any reference to the traditional use of the land’s resources.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage indicates that the treaty does not mention water rights.
Explanation E: E. The passage’s reference to Arizona v. California relates to the treaty that established the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation only in that Arizona v. California refers to the Winters doctrine, which was established in a case regarding that treaty; Arizona v. California does not modify that treaty in any way.

Therefore, the reserved water rights of Pueblo Indians have priority over other citizens’ water rights as of 1848, the year in which pueblos must be considered to have become reservations.

### Question:
The passage suggests that, if the criteria discussed in lines 10–20 of the text were the only criteria for establishing a reservation’s water rights, which of the following would be true?
A: A. The water rights of the inhabitants of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation would not take precedence over those of other citizens.
B: B. Reservations established before 1848 would be judged to have no water rights.
C: C. There would be no legal basis for the water rights of the Rio Grande pueblos.
D: D. Reservations other than American Indian reservations could not be created with reserved water rights.
E: E. Treaties establishing reservations would have to mention water rights explicitly in order to reserve water for a particular purpose.

### Response:
<think>
Inference The question requires you to make an inference based on a hypothetical situation in which the criteria discussed in lines 10–20 are the only criteria relevant to establishing a reservation’s water rights. These criteria relate to any reservation that has been formally withdrawn from federal public lands, in which the circumstances of that withdrawal make clear that the government had intended to reserve both water and land when the reservation was established. Because the Rio Grande pueblos never formally constituted a part of federal public lands, they were never formally withdrawn from these lands, and so this set of criteria does not apply to these pueblos. Thus, if these were the only legal criteria for establishing water rights, then there would be no legal basis for water rights for the Rio Grande pueblos.
Explanation A: A. The criteria, which were established on the precedent set in the Winters v. United States ruling, all apply to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.
Explanation B: B. Although in actual fact there were no Indian reservations formally established before 1848, nothing in the passage suggests that there were not any, or that none would have met the criteria.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If the criteria were the only criteria relevant for establishing water rights, then the passage suggests that, because the Rio Grande pueblos were never formally withdrawn from federal public lands, there would be no legal basis for water rights for these pueblos.
Explanation D: D. The criteria as expressed in the passage do not restrict the type of reservation covered to American Indian reservations.
Explanation E: E. The criteria are meant to cover any circumstances in which the government intended to reserve water rights, whether water rights are explicitly mentioned or not.

### Question:
Which of the following most accurately summarizes the relationship between Arizona v California, as that decision is described in the passage, and the criteria discussed in lines 10– 20?
A: A. Arizona v. California abolishes these criteria and establishes a competing set of criteria for applying the Winters doctrine.
B: B. Arizona v. California establishes that the Winters doctrine applies to a broader range of situations than those defined by these criteria.
C: C. Arizona v. California represents the sole example of an exception to the criteria as they were set forth in the Winters doctrine.
D: D. Arizona v. California does not refer to the Winters doctrine to justify water rights, whereas these criteria do rely on the Winters doctrine.
E: E. Arizona v. California applies the criteria derived from the Winters doctrine only to federal lands other than American Indian reservations.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question requires you to determine how Arizona v. California, as it is described in the passage, relates to the criteria discussed in lines 10–20. Those criteria, which were established in various decisions based on the precedent of Winters v. United States, lay down conditions under which courts can uphold federal rights to reserve water. One of the criteria is related to land formally withdrawn from federal public lands. Arizona v. California establishes that the Winters doctrine—which stipulates that water rights need not have been granted explicitly— applies to a broader range of situations than those defined by the criteria. For instance, the doctrine can apply in cases in which the land in question was never formally withdrawn from public lands.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not indicate that Arizona v. California abolishes these criteria. It merely indicates that Arizona v. California recognizes further situations to which the Winters doctrine can apply.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage indicates that Arizona v. California applies the Winters doctrine to a situation that falls outside these criteria.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate that there are no other exceptions besides Arizona v. California to these criteria.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates that Arizona v. California does refer to the Winters doctrine to justify water rights.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not indicate that Arizona v. California applies these criteria at all; instead, Arizona v. California broadens the range of situations to which the Winters doctrine applies.

C: C. gives federal courts the right to reserve water along with land even when it is clear that the government originally intended to reserve only the land
D: D. bases the decision to recognize the legal rights of a group on the practical effect such a recognition is likely to have on other citizens
E: E. dictates that courts ignore precedents set by such cases as Winters v. United States in deciding what water rights belong to reserved land

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question depends on determining how the term pragmatic approach is used in lines 37– 38. The passage states that what constitutes an American Indian reservation is a matter not of legal definition, but of practice. The Rio Grande pueblos, though they were never formally established by a withdrawal from federal public lands, have always been treated in practice as reservations. This is what is described in the passage as a pragmatic approach.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage refers to the idea that [w]hat constitutes an American Indian reservation is a question of practice, not of legal definition as a pragmatic approach. Thus, the pragmatic approach does not require that a reservation has been formally established, but only that it has been traditionally treated as such.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not concern itself with the water rights of all citizens.
Explanation C: C. The passage clearly indicates that determining whether the government intended to reserve water along with the land is crucial for courts.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not specifically consider the likely practical effect of recognizing a particular group’s legal rights on other citizens.
Explanation E: E. The passage indicates that the pragmatic approach is supported by Arizona v. California, which used, and expanded on, the precedent set by Winters v. United States.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that the Winters doctrine has been used to establish which of the following?
A: A. A rule that the government may reserve water only by explicit treaty or agreement
B: B. A legal distinction between federal lands reserved for American Indians and federal lands reserved for other purposes
C: C. Criteria governing when the federal government may set land aside for a particular purpose
D: D. The special status of American Indian tribes’ rights to reserved land
E: E. The federal right to reserve water implicitly as well as explicitly under certain conditions

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question requires you to make an inference based on facts the passage cites regarding the Winters doctrine. The passage indicates that the Supreme Court ruled in Winters v. United States that, despite the fact that the treaty establishing the Berthold Indian Reservation made no explicit mention of water rights, the federal government had intended to reserve such rights to the American Indians living on that reservation. Later court rulings that cited the Winters ruling as precedent further refined this doctrine such that water rights can be reserved implicitly if circumstances reveal [that] the government intended to reserve water as well as land when establishing the reservation.
Explanation A: A. The passage states that the Winters doctrine ruled that even if a treaty has not explicitly reserved water, water may be reserved if conditions reveal that the reservation of water had been intended.
Explanation B: B. The passage indicates that the Winters doctrine presupposes such a legal distinction; it does not establish it.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not give any information that suggests that the Winters doctrine has been used to establish any criteria governing when the federal government may set land aside for a particular purpose.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates that the Winters doctrine gives special status to the water flowing through reserved lands, but it does not suggest that the doctrine has been used to establish any special status of American Indian tribes’ rights to those lands.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The passage provides information suggesting that the Winters doctrine has been used to establish a federal right to implicitly reserve water under certain conditions.

Therefore, the reserved water rights of Pueblo Indians have priority over other citizens’ water rights as of 1848, the year in which pueblos must be considered to have become reservations.

### Question:
The author cites the fact that the Rio Grande pueblos were never formally withdrawn from public lands primarily in order to do which of the following?
A: A. Suggest why it might have been argued that the Winters doctrine ought not to apply to pueblo lands
B: B. Imply that the United States never really acquired sovereignty over pueblo lands
C: C. Argue that the pueblo lands ought still to be considered part of federal public lands
D: D. Support the argument that the water rights of citizens other than American Indians are limited by the Winters doctrine
E: E. Suggest that federal courts cannot claim jurisdiction over cases disputing the traditional diversion and use of water by Pueblo Indians

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation The passage in the first paragraph outlines a set of criteria that, through various court decisions using the Winters decision as precedent, refined what came to be known as the Winters doctrine. These decisions established that courts can uphold federal rights to reserve water (specifically, for use by American Indians) if, among other conditions, the land has been formally withdrawn from federal public lands. Because the Rio Grande pueblos never formally constituted a part of federal public lands, it might appear that the Winters doctrine would not apply to them. The passage indicates, however, that Arizona v. California established that this doctrine did apply to them.
Explanation A: A. Correct. Because the Rio Grande pueblo lands were never formally withdrawn from federal public lands—because they never were a part of federal public lands—it might have appeared that the Winters doctrine did not apply to them, because that doctrine had traditionally been taken to apply only to land that had been formally withdrawn from federal public lands.
Explanation B: B. The passage does suggest that the federal government never acquired sovereignty over the Rio Grande pueblos. But the passage indicates this not by citing the fact that the pueblos were never formally withdrawn from public lands, but by pointing out that these pueblos were never part of federal public lands in the first place.
Explanation C: C. The passage states that the pueblo lands were never considered to be part of federal public lands.
Explanation D: D. It is not the fact that these lands were never withdrawn from federal public lands that is cited in support of this argument; it is, rather, the fact that these lands were never part of federal public lands that is cited for this purpose.
Explanation E: E. The passage actually suggests the opposite of what this says, namely, that federal courts can claim jurisdiction over such cases.

### Passage:
In Winters v. United States (1908), the Supreme Court held that the right to use waters flowing through or adjacent to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation was reserved to American Indians by the treaty establishing the reservation. Although this treaty did not mention water rights, the Court ruled that the federal government, when it created the reservation, intended to deal fairly with American Indians by reserving for them the waters without which their lands would have been useless. Later decisions, citing Winters, established that courts can find federal rights to reserve water for particular purposes if (1) the land in question lies within an enclave under exclusive federal jurisdiction; (2) the land has been formally withdrawn from federal public lands—i.e., withdrawn from the stock of federal lands available for private use under federal land use laws—and set aside or reserved; and (3) the circumstances reveal the government intended to reserve water as well as land when establishing the reservation.  Some American Indian tribes have also established water rights through the courts based on their traditional diversion and use of certain waters prior to the United States’ acquisition of sovereignty. For example, the Rio Grande pueblos already existed when the United States acquired sovereignty over New Mexico in 1848. Although they at that time became part of the United States, the pueblo lands never formally constituted a part of federal public lands; in any event, no treaty, statute, or executive order has ever designated or withdrawn the pueblos from public lands as American Indian reservations. This fact, however, has not barred application of the Winters doctrine. What constitutes an American Indian reservation is a question of practice, not of legal definition, and the pueblos have always been treated as reservations by the United States. This pragmatic approach is buttressed by Arizona v. California (1963), wherein the Supreme Court indicated that the manner in which any type of federal reservation is created does not affect the application to it of the Winters doctrine. Therefore, the reserved water rights of Pueblo Indians have priority over other citizens’ water rights as of 1848, the year in which pueblos must be considered to have become reservations.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. trace the development of laws establishing American Indian reservations
B: B. explain the legal bases for the water rights of American Indian tribes
C: C. question the legal criteria often used to determine the water rights of American Indian tribes
D: D. discuss evidence establishing the earliest date at which the federal government recognized the water rights of American Indians
E: E. point out a legal distinction between different types of American Indian reservations

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea Answering this question requires identifying the primary purpose of the passage. The passage is mainly concerned with describing the legal bases of American Indian tribal water rights.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not discuss the development of laws establishing reservations. It is concerned with American Indian water rights.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage’s primary concern is to discuss certain principles relating to American Indian water rights established in various court cases.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not question the legal criteria it discusses.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates that a groundbreaking Supreme Court ruling regarding the water rights of American Indians was handed down in 1908, but that ruling suggested that the federal government had intended at an earlier stage, in the treaty establishing the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, to recognize water rights; the passage gives no indication, though, of the date of that treaty, nor whether that treaty would have been the first recognition in law of such rights. The passage is concerned with the legal bases of American Indian water rights, not with when the federal government first recognized them.
Explanation E: E. The passage does discuss both lands that have been explicitly created as reservations by treaty and lands that have been treated as reservations although they had never been legally constituted as such; however, (1) the passage indicates that in crucial ways there are no legal distinctions between these two different types of American reservation, and (2) this is not the primary focus of the passage, which, instead, concerns the legal bases of American Indian water rights.

### Passage:
In Winters v. United States (1908), the Supreme Court held that the right to use waters flowing through or adjacent to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation was reserved to American Indians by the treaty establishing the reservation. Although this treaty did not mention water rights, the Court ruled that the federal government, when it created the reservation, intended to deal fairly with American Indians by reserving for them the waters without which their lands would have been useless. Later decisions, citing Winters, established that courts can find federal rights to reserve water for particular purposes if (1) the land in question lies within an enclave under exclusive federal jurisdiction; (2) the land has been formally withdrawn from federal public lands—i.e., withdrawn from the stock of federal lands available for private use under federal land use laws—and set aside or reserved; and (3) the circumstances reveal the government intended to reserve water as well as land when establishing the reservation.  Some American Indian tribes have also established water rights through the courts based on their traditional diversion and use of certain waters prior to the United States’ acquisition of sovereignty. For example, the Rio Grande pueblos already existed when the United States acquired sovereignty over New Mexico in 1848. Although they at that time became part of the United States, the pueblo lands never formally constituted a part of federal public lands; in any event, no treaty, statute, or executive order has ever designated or withdrawn the pueblos from public lands as American Indian reservations. This fact, however, has not barred application of the Winters doctrine.

Therefore, the reserved water rights of Pueblo Indians have priority over other citizens’ water rights as of 1848, the year in which pueblos must be considered to have become reservations.

### Question:
The passage suggests that the legal rights of citizens other than American Indians to the use of water flowing into the Rio Grande pueblos are
A: A. guaranteed by the precedent set in Arizona v. California
B: B. abolished by the Winters doctrine
C: C. deferred to the Pueblo Indians whenever treaties explicitly require this
D: D. guaranteed by federal land-use laws
E: E. limited by the prior claims of the Pueblo Indians

### Response:
<think>
Inference The question requires you to make an inference regarding the legal rights of citizens other than American Indians to the use of water flowing into the Rio Grande pueblos. The second paragraph of the passage discusses the Rio Grande pueblos, the rights to the water flowing into them, and the legal bases regarding those rights. Most relevantly to this question, the final sentence of the passage indicates that the reserved water rights of Pueblo Indians have priority over other citizens’ water rights.
Explanation A: A. The passage indicates that the precedent set in Arizona v. California declares that the Winters doctrine applies to the pueblos, despite their never having been explicitly set aside as a reservation. This gave the inhabitants of the pueblos priority rights to water. Thus, the legal rights of citizens other than American Indians are not guaranteed by the precedent set in that ruling.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not rule out the possibility that citizens other than American Indians may have some rights to the water; their rights are merely limited by the prior claims of the Pueblo Indians.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not explicitly discuss treaties to which Pueblo Indians are a party.
Explanation D: D. The passage gives no indication that federal land-use laws guarantee the legal rights of citizens other than American Indians to water flowing into the Rio Grande pueblos.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The passage explicitly states that the reserved water rights of Pueblo Indians have priority over other citizens’ water rights.

E Main Idea Summary The passage seeks to provide guidance about when companies should subject their suppliers to “competitive scrutiny” (readily comparing suppliers to provide the purchaser with economic leverage) and when they should accept “supplier partnerships” (arrangements in which the purchaser forgoes the right to pursue alternative suppliers). It does this primarily by distinguishing among four types of situations, each with its own set of implications for which approach is likely to be more advantageous."

### Passage:
In corporate purchasing, competitive scrutiny is typically limited to suppliers of items that are directly related to end products. With “indirect” purchases (such as computers, advertising, and legal services), which are not directly related to production, corporations often favor “supplier partnerships” (arrangements in which the purchaser forgoes the right to pursue alternative suppliers), which can inappropriately shelter suppliers from rigorous competitive scrutiny that might afford the purchaser economic leverage. There are two independent variables—availability of alternatives and ease of changing suppliers—that companies should use to evaluate the feasibility of subjecting suppliers of indirect purchases to competitive scrutiny. This can create four possible situations.  In Type 1 situations, there are many alternatives and change is relatively easy. Open pursuit of alternatives—by frequent competitive bidding, if possible—will likely yield the best results. In Type 2 situations, where there are many alternatives but change is difficult—as for providers of employee health care benefits—it is important to continuously test the market and use the results to secure concessions from existing suppliers. Alternatives provide a credible threat to suppliers, even if the ability to switch is constrained. In Type 3 situations, there are few alternatives, but the ability to switch without difficulty creates a threat that companies can use to negotiate concessions from existing suppliers. In Type 4 situations, where there are few alternatives and change is difficult, partnerships may be unavoidable.

### Question:
Which of the following can be inferred about supplier partnerships, as they are described in the passage?
A: A. They cannot be sustained unless the goods or services provided are available from a large number of suppliers.
B: B. They can result in purchasers paying more for goods and services than they would in a competitive-bidding situation.
C: C. They typically are instituted at the urging of the supplier rather than the purchaser.
D: D. They are not feasible when the goods or services provided are directly related to the purchasers’ end products.
E: E. They are least appropriate when the purchasers’ ability to change suppliers is limited.

### Response:
<think>
Inference According to the passage, in supplier partnerships a corporate purchaser forgoes the right to pursue alternative suppliers for certain goods or services. This tends to reduce or eliminate the threat of competition for the supplier in the partnership. It can be inferred that the corporate purchaser in a supplier partnership risks paying more for goods or services than it would if the supplier had to compete for the business.
Explanation A: A. The passage suggests something incompatible with this, i.e., that availability of the relevant goods or services from many suppliers would undermine rather than strengthen a supplier partnership.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage indicates that supplier partnerships, by definition, reduce the supplier’s exposure to competition, and it can be inferred from this that a purchaser in such a partnership could sometimes pay more for the supplied goods or services than if not in the partnership.
Explanation C: C. The passage is silent on how supplier partnerships are initiated, and the passage gives no reason to believe that these would usually be initiated by suppliers.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates that supplier partnerships are usually instituted for the supply of goods or services that do not contribute directly to the company’s end products, though the passage gives no reason to believe that such partnerships would never make sense for supply of items directly related to end products.
Explanation E: E. The passage states that where alternative suppliers for certain goods or services are few and change from an existing supplier is difficult, partnerships may be unavoidable. This seems to imply that in such cases, supplier partnerships are the most appropriate.

### Question:
Which of the following best describes the relation of the second paragraph to the first?
A: A. The second paragraph offers proof of an assertion made in the first paragraph.
B: B. The second paragraph provides an explanation for the occurrence of a situation described in the first paragraph.
C: C. The second paragraph discusses the application of a strategy proposed in the first paragraph.
D: D. The second paragraph examines the scope of a problem presented in the first paragraph.
E: E. The second paragraph discusses the contradictions inherent in a relationship described in the first paragraph.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation The first paragraph recommends that a corporate purchaser of certain categories of goods and services should consider two variables to evaluate how, if at all, it might exert pressure on a supplier to gain economic advantage. Applying the two variables, the second paragraph identifies four different scenarios and, for each scenario, explains how the purchaser can gain some economic advantage.
Explanation A: A. The second paragraph is not focused on proving anything; rather, it conducts an analysis of the ways in which, under various conditions, a corporate purchaser can gain economic advantage from a supplier.
Explanation B: B. The second paragraph conducts an analysis of various situations affecting the feasibility of a purchaser’s exerting pressure to gain economic advantage from a supplier; it is not focused on explaining what causes the occurrence of any situation mentioned in the first paragraph.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The first paragraph recommends that corporate purchasers consider two variables in analyzing the feasibility of exerting pressure on suppliers with a view to economic advantage; the second paragraph shows how purchasers can apply those variables to identify four different types of situations affecting the degree to which economic advantage can be gained by exerting competitive pressure.
Explanation D: D. The first paragraph is not focused on presenting a problem, but rather on indicating an approach that purchasers might use in evaluating the feasibility of exerting economic pressure on suppliers with a view to economic advantage. The second paragraph elaborates on the suggested approach.
Explanation E: E. The second paragraph does not characterize as contradictory any relationship involved in the four types of situations it discusses. The first paragraph discusses supplier partnerships and identifies a disadvantage that they sometimes involve for purchasers, but the discussion in the second paragraph does not focus exclusively on situations that involve a supplier partnership.

### Question:
It can be inferred that the author of the passage would be most likely to make which of the following recommendations to a company purchasing health care benefits for its employees?
A: A. Devise strategies for circumventing the obstacles to replacing the current provider of health care benefits.
B: B. Obtain health care benefits from a provider that also provides other indirect products and services.
C: C. Obtain bids from other providers of health care benefits in order to be in a position to negotiate a better deal with the current provider.
D: D. Switch providers of health care benefits whenever a different provider offers a more competitive price.
E: E. Acknowledge the difficulties involved in replacing the current provider of health care benefits and offer to form a partnership with the provider.

### Response:
<think>
Inference In the passage, health care benefits are used as an example of a Type 2 situation, where there are many competing providers but changing from one provider to another is difficult. In Type 2 situations, the author of the passage recommends that the corporate purchaser examine the alternative providers to provide leverage in bargaining with the existing provider.
Explanation A: A. Presumably handling any obstacles to replacement would be necessary if a corporate purchaser had decided to change providers. The author of the passage does not preclude the possibility that this may sometimes be a reasonable decision but does not recommend it.
Explanation B: B. The author of the passage does not consider such a possibility and does not even recommend switching from the existing provider in a Type 2 situation.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The recommendation offered in the passage is to review competitive alternatives to the existing provider, with a view to bargaining effectively for better terms with the existing provider.
Explanation D: D. As already noted, the author of the passage does not recommend switching from the existing provider, but rather recommends reviewing competitive alternatives to exert pressure on the existing provider to grant more favorable terms.
Explanation E: E. The author of the passage does not recommend this course of action in a Type 2 situation, which the corporate purchase of health care benefits exemplifies. The only situation in which the author views a supplier partnership as possibly the best of a set of bad options is a Type 4 situation, where there are few competitive alternatives available and change is difficult.

A: A. The number of alternative suppliers available to the purchaser
B: B. The most effective approach for the purchaser to use in obtaining competitive bids from potential suppliers
C: C. The degree of difficulty the purchaser encounters when changing suppliers
D: D. The frequency with which each type of situation occurs in a typical business environment
E: E. The likelihood that any given purchase will be an indirect purchase

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation According to the passage, Type 2 situations are those where there are several competitive alternative suppliers available but changing from the existing supplier would be difficult. Type 4 situations are those where there are few competitive alternative suppliers and changing from the existing supplier would be difficult.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The two types of situations differ in the number of competitive alternatives to the existing supplier that are available: in Type 2 situations there are several; in Type 4 situations there are few.
Explanation B: B. How should the prospective purchaser ensure that potential suppliers submit truly competitive bids, or can a prospective purchaser even ensure it? The passage gives no answer to such questions that helps to identify a difference between the two types of situations.
Explanation C: C. In both types of situations as described in the passage, changing to a new supplier is difficult, and no difference in the degree of difficulty is mentioned.
Explanation D: D. How frequently each of the two types of situations typically occurs is not addressed in the passage.
Explanation E: E. Indirect purchases, as described in the passage, are goods or services that are not embodied in the corporation’s end products. Many corporate producers currently make indirect purchases such as computers or business consultancy services. The passage does not compare the proportion of a corporation’s total purchases that are indirect (the proportion would presumably vary widely depending on the nature of a corporation’s production), so the passage provides no rational basis for estimating a universally applicable likelihood that a given purchase would be indirect.

### Question:

A: A. The ability of the purchasing company to subject potential suppliers of the purchased item to competitive scrutiny
B: B. The number of suppliers of the purchased item available to the purchasing company
C: C. The methods of negotiation that are available to the purchasing company
D: D. The relationship of the purchased item to the purchasing company’s end product
E: E. The degree of importance of the purchased item in the purchasing company’s business operations

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The passage characterizes a purchase of goods or services as indirect when the goods or services are not directly related to the end products of the purchasing corporation. Examples given are computers, advertising, and legal services. By implication, direct purchases by an automobile manufacturer could include steel, batteries, and tires: these would obviously be inputs embodied in the final products.
Explanation A: A. The passage suggests that competitive scrutiny is typically applied only to suppliers of direct purchases, but it makes the case that it could also be applied to suppliers of indirect purchases. The exposure to competitive scrutiny is not the characteristic that the passage uses to distinguish direct from indirect purchases.
Explanation B: B. The number of available suppliers clearly can vary for both direct purchases and indirect purchases, and the passage provides no reason to think otherwise.
Explanation C: C. The passage provides no information about the methods of negotiation that are available for direct purchases. The passage does not base the distinction between direct and indirect purchases on differences in methods of negotiation.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage defines direct purchases as those directly related to the purchasing firm’s end products; indirect purchases are purchases that are not related to the end products.
Explanation E: E. The type of purchase—direct or indirect—is not, according to the passage, determined by the degree of importance of the purchase in facilitating the purchasing firm’s business operations. For example, purchase of advertising by an accounting firm could be critically important for success of the firm’s business operations, but such a purchase would likely count as indirect, given the way the passage defines indirect purchases.

D Main Idea Summary The passage serves primarily to support the notion that carotenoids are meaningful in the context of mate selection not only because they are rare but because they are required. The passage begins with a discussion of carotenoids and the role they play in mate selection among animals. The passage then considers the question of why they play this role. The traditional view is that they do so because they are rare, but the passage asserts that there is growing evidence that they also do so because they are required for health. Males that are genetically resistant to disease and parasites can use carotenoids for flashy display instead of using them entirely for fighting disease."

Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Carotenoids, a family of natural pigments, form an important part of the colorful signals used by many animals. Animals acquire carotenoids either directly (from the plants and algae that produce them) or indirectly (by eating insects) and store them in a variety of tissues. Studies of several animal species have shown that when choosing mates, females prefer males with brighter carotenoid-based coloration. Owens and Olson hypothesize that the presence of carotenoids, as signaled by coloration, would be meaningful in the context of mate selection if carotenoids were either rare or required for health. The conventional view is that carotenoids are meaningful because they are rare: healthier males can forage for more of the pigments than can their inferior counterparts. Although this may be true, there is growing evidence that carotenoids are meaningful also because they are required: they are used by the immune system and for detoxification processes that are important for maintaining health. It may be that males can use scarce carotenoids either for immune defense and detoxification or for attracting females. Males that are more susceptible to disease and parasites will have to use their carotenoids to boost their immune systems, whereas males that are genetically resistant will use fewer carotenoids for fighting disease and will advertise this by using the pigments for flashy display instead.

### Question:
According to the “conventional view” referred to in line 13 of the passage, brighter carotenoid-based coloration in certain species suggests that an individual
A: A. lives in a habitat rich in carotenoid-bearing plants and insects

Supporting Idea According to the passage, the conventional view is that carotenoids in a male animal— recognizable by brighter coloration—are meaningful in the context of mate selection because they are rare and not easily acquired. A male that displays brighter coloration than other males would appear to a female of the species to have foraged more effectively and would therefore seem healthier, and more eligible as a mate, than some less brightly colored males.
Explanation A: A. Male animals in a carotenoid-rich environment might, on average, have brighter coloration, but the passage does not imply that this is part of the conventional view. The passage represents the conventional view as emphasizing the rarity of carotenoids, and the consequent difficulty of finding them.
Explanation B: B. The conventional view holds that a brightly colored male might appear healthier than less brightly colored males to a female of the species. If the male were healthier, this would presumably require having efficient detoxification processes. But the passage does not treat this as part of the conventional view.
Explanation C: C. If a male animal is healthier than other males of the species, presumably that male has a superior immune system, but the passage does not represent this as part of the conventional view.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage represents the conventional view as holding that more brightly colored males seem to females to be more effective foragers, and therefore healthier.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not represent the conventional view as holding that brighter coloration in a male animal would be taken by a female of the species as indicating a current ability to reproduce.

Focus on understanding the main idea, supporting details, author's purpose, and inferences that can be drawn from the passage. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Carotenoids, a family of natural pigments, form an important part of the colorful signals used by many animals. Animals acquire carotenoids either directly (from the plants and algae that produce them) or indirectly (by eating insects) and store them in a variety of tissues. Studies of several animal species have shown that when choosing mates, females prefer males with brighter carotenoid-based coloration. Owens and Olson hypothesize that the presence of carotenoids, as signaled by coloration, would be meaningful in the context of mate selection if carotenoids were either rare or required for health. The conventional view is that carotenoids are meaningful because they are rare: healthier males can forage for more of the pigments than can their inferior counterparts. Although this may be true, there is growing evidence that carotenoids are meaningful also because they are required: they are used by the immune system and for detoxification processes that are important for maintaining health. It may be that males can use scarce carotenoids either for immune defense and detoxification or for attracting females. Males that are more susceptible to disease and parasites will have to use their carotenoids to boost their immune systems, whereas males that are genetically resistant will use fewer carotenoids for fighting disease and will advertise this by using the pigments for flashy display instead.

### Question:
The idea that carotenoid-based coloration is significant partly because carotenoids are required for health suggests that a lack of bright coloration in a male is most likely to indicate which of the following?
A: A. Inefficient detoxification processes
B: B. Immunity to parasite infestation
C: C. Low genetic resistance to disease
D: D. Lack of interest in mating
E: E. Lack of carotenoid-storing tissues

### Response:
<think>
Inference The passage states that carotenoids are used by the immune system and for detoxification processes that help maintain health. Males that are more susceptible to disease and parasites, i.e., males that lack high genetic resistance to such things, must use up the carotenoids they accumulate to boost their immune systems. The passage suggests that consequently, male animals perceived by females of the species as having used up their carotenoids would be perceived as having relatively low genetic resistance to disease and parasites.
Explanation A: A. Even if an animal has efficient detoxification processes, the passage suggests that carotenoids would be used up in such processes. Thus, having relatively less bright coloration (and therefore less carotenoids) would not necessarily indicate inefficient detoxification processes.
Explanation B: B. The information in the passage suggests that having low genetic resistance to parasite infections is consistent with having immunity to at least some parasite infections, because carotenoids can be used to boost immunity. But this comes at the cost of lacking bright coloration.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage indicates that a male’s having relatively bright coloration could indicate relatively high genetic resistance to disease, and having relatively less bright coloration could indicate relatively low genetic resistance, because the carotenoids that create bright coloration would have been used to boost immunity or aid detoxification processes.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not suggest that male animals lacking bright coloration would be perceived by a female of the species as lacking interest in mating.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not address the issue of whether carotenoid-storing tissues may be lacking in a male of a species that would normally have such tissues. The passage only states that many animal species use colorful signals made possible by carotenoids.

### Question:
The passage suggests that relatively bright carotenoid-based coloration is a signal of which of the following characteristics in males of certain animal species?
A: A. Readiness for mating behavior
B: B. Ability to fight
C: C. Particular feeding preferences
D: D. Recovery from parasite infestation
E: E. Fitness as a mate

### Response:
<think>
Application According to the passage, studies of several animal species have shown that when choosing mates, females prefer males with brighter, carotenoid-based coloration. The passage examines two mechanisms by which carotenoid-based coloration might affect mate selection: either signaling good health or signaling high genetic resistance to infection. It is implicit in the discussion that whichever mechanism is in question, bright coloration would function to signal fitness as a mate.
Explanation A: A. The passage discusses how bright carotenoid-based coloration may affect mate selection but does not cite perceived bright coloration as signaling readiness for mating behavior.
Explanation B: B. The passage suggests that bright carotenoid-based coloration tends to signal good health or genetic resistance to factors that cause illness. The passage does not refer to ability to fight.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not refer to feeding preferences, but only indicates that animals with bright carotenoid-based coloration would have consumed organisms that are rich in carotenoids.
Explanation D: D. The passage explores the possibility that bright carotenoid-based coloration could signal high genetic resistance to infection, but it implies that recovery from infection could arise from strong immune resistance rather than from high genetic resistance and could be signaled by lack of carotenoid-based brightness.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The passage discussion indicates that, whatever the precise mechanism, bright carotenoid-based coloration in males of certain species functions to signal fitness as a mate.

A: A. They do not produce carotenoids themselves.
B: B. They use carotenoids primarily for coloration.
C: C. They maintain constant levels of carotenoids in their tissues.
D: D. They are unable to use carotenoids to boost their immune system.
E: E. They are available in greater abundance than are carotenoid-bearing plants.

### Response:
<think>
Inference The passage says that animals acquire carotenoids either directly (from the plants and algae that produce them) or indirectly (by eating insects).
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage indicates that the phrase acquire . . . directly signifies in this context acquisition from the ultimate source of carotenoids, so the phrase acquire . . . indirectly signifies an acquisition that is not from the ultimate source. This implies that insects do not produce their own carotenoids, but rather derive them by consuming plants, algae, or other insects.
Explanation B: B. This may well be true of some insects, but no information in the passage implies it.
Explanation C: C. No information in the passage implies that carotenoid levels in insect tissue remain constant over time.
Explanation D: D. The passage contains no information that relates to the immune system of any insect species.
Explanation E: E. Even if this is true, the passage contains no information that implies it.

### Question:
Information in the passage suggests that which of the following is true of carotenoids that a male animal uses for detoxification processes?
A: A. They were not acquired directly from plants and algae.
B: B. They cannot be replenished through foraging.
C: C. They cannot be used simultaneously to brighten coloration.
D: D. They do not affect the animal’s susceptibility to parasites.
E: E. They increase the chances that the animal will be selected as a mate.

### Response:
<think>
Inference The passage states that carotenoids are used by the immune system and for detoxification processes. To the extent that any carotenoids are used for these purposes, the passage suggests, they would not also be available for bright-colored display to potential mates.
Explanation A: A. The passage states that animals can acquire carotenoids from insects, as well as from plants and algae. Nothing indicates that a male animal’s use of the carotenoids would determine which of these sources they are acquired from.
Explanation B: B. No information in the passage suggests this. The passage tells us that males acquire carotenoids by foraging.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage implies that the quantity of carotenoids used for detoxification is no longer available for any other purpose, such as display of bright coloration.
Explanation D: D. The passage suggests that carotenoids could benefit immune response; this implies the possibility of better resistance to parasitic infections.
Explanation E: E. The passage conjectures that a male animal’s use of carotenoids for detoxification processes could reduce the chances of being selected as a mate.

C Main Idea Summary The passage is a discussion of historian Linda Kerber’s “republican motherhood” thesis, according to which the American Revolution led to an increase in educational opportunities for women and girls in the United States in the late eighteenth century. Kerber’s work was influential at least partly because she explored a topic (female education) that historians had largely ignored. However, the passage cites an earlier historian who had provided evidence that the trend toward greater educational opportunities for women and girls had begun decades before the American Revolution. The main idea of the passage is that the influence of the “republican motherhood” thesis may have led historians to overlook evidence that the trend Kerber describes was already underway before the American Revolution."

Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Linda Kerber argued in the mid-1980s that after the American Revolution (1775–1783), an ideology of “republican motherhood” resulted in a surge of educational opportunities for women in the United States. Kerber maintained that the leaders of the new nation wanted women to be educated in order to raise politically virtuous sons. A virtuous citizenry was considered essential to the success of the country’s republican form of government; virtue was to be instilled not only by churches and schools, but by families, where the mother’s role was crucial. Thus, according to Kerber, motherhood became pivotal to the fate of the republic, providing justification for an unprecedented attention to female education.  Introduction of the “republican motherhood” thesis dramatically changed historiography. Prior to Kerber’s work, educational historians barely mentioned women and girls; Thomas Woody’s 1929 work is the notable exception. Examining newspaper advertisements for academies, Woody found that educational opportunities increased for both girls and boys around 1750. Pointing to “An Essay on Woman” (1753) as reflecting a shift in view, Woody also claimed that practical education for females had many advocates before the Revolution. Woody’s evidence challenges the notion that the Revolution changed attitudes regarding female education, although it may have accelerated earlier trends. Historians’ reliance on Kerber’s “republican motherhood” thesis may have obscured the presence of these trends, making it difficult to determine to what extent the Revolution really changed women’s lives.

### Question:
According to the passage, Kerber maintained that which of the following led to an increase in educational opportunities for women in the United States after the American Revolution?
A: A. An unprecedented demand by women for greater educational opportunities in the decades following the Revolution
B: B. A new political ideology calling for equality of opportunity between women and men in all aspects of life
C: C. A belief that the American educational system could be reformed only if women participated more fully in that system
D: D. A belief that women needed to be educated if they were to contribute to the success of the nation’s new form of government
E: E. A recognition that women needed to be educated if they were to take an active role in the nation’s schools and churches

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The passage ascribes to Linda Kerber the claim that there was a surge of educational opportunities for women in the United States after the American Revolution, and that this surge resulted from a new ideology of “republican motherhood.” According to the passage, Kerber argued that the nation’s leaders advocated education for women to equip them, in their family role, to raise politically virtuous sons.
Explanation A: A. The passage attributes no claim to Kerber concerning a demand by women for education.
Explanation B: B. The passage attributes no claim to Kerber concerning a new ideology calling for equality between women and men.
Explanation C: C. Kerber’s argument as represented in the passage did not claim that an increase in education opportunities for women resulted from a belief that such an increase was required for successful reform of the American educational system.
Explanation D: D. Correct. According to the passage, Kerber argued that educational opportunities for women increased because the nation’s leaders believed that successful democratic government would require that women raise politically virtuous sons within their families, and that women could do so only if they had access to education themselves.
Explanation E: E. According to the passage, Kerber’s thesis primarily concerns the roles that it was believed educated women could play in raising politically virtuous sons in the context of the family, not in the nation’s schools or churches.

Application According to the passage, Woody characterized “An Essay on Woman” (1753) as reflecting a shift in view, and the context indicates that this shift concerned new attitudes that accompanied increased opportunities after 1750 for girls to become educated women.
Explanation A: A. Correct. Based on the passage, this is a claim with which Woody would likely have agreed.
Explanation B: B. The passage represents Woody as claiming that “An Essay on Woman” reflected changes that had already occurred around 1750. The passage does not indicate whether Woody would have agreed with this claim about a persuasive effect on educators.
Explanation C: C. Nothing in the passage represents Woody as thinking that “An Essay on Woman” had ideas about women’s education that did not come to fruition until after the American Revolution. The tenor of Woody’s thinking, as the passage represents it, is that the essay reflected changes already occurring.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates that Woody characterizes “An Essay on Woman” as reflecting a view that had already gained some currency, so it is unlikely that Woody saw the essay as offering any highly original arguments in favor of women’s education.

Evaluation The passage represents Kerber as claiming that the American Revolution led to a surge in educational opportunities for women because the nation’s leaders believed women needed to be educated if they were to raise politically virtuous sons. Woody, however, is represented as claiming that there was a significant increase in such opportunities and significant advocacy for women’s education well before the Revolution.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not represent either Kerber or Woody as addressing the extent to which women were interested in pursuing educational opportunities in the eighteenth century.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage attributes to Woody the view that practical education for females had many advocates before the Revolution, notably in the 1750s, and that the Revolution at most accelerated an earlier trend of changing attitudes. This is contrary to the views attributed to Kerber.
Explanation C: C. The passage gives no information as to whether Kerber or Woody addresses this issue, nor does it discuss to what extent, if any, such resistance may have occurred.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates that Kerber and Woody hold that there was a change in attitudes toward women’s educational opportunities during the eighteenth century, disagreeing, however, as to whether the most significant change occurred before or after the Revolution.
Explanation E: E. Neither Kerber nor Woody is represented by the passage as holding divergent views on this point, and it would be reasonable to think that they may have agreed.

Supporting Idea The passage attributes to Kerber the claim that the nation’s leaders believed a virtuous citizenry was essential to the success of the nation’s republican form of government, and that women would play a primary role in raising future citizens who would be politically virtuous.
Explanation A: A. According to the passage, Kerber indicates that the nation’s leaders believed churches and schools, as well as families, would work to imbue political virtue, though they emphasized the crucial role of families.
Explanation B: B. Kerber argues that the educational system underwent reform in the sense that educational opportunities for women increased but does not claim that schools or families would change focus to imbue girls with political virtue.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Kerber argues that political leaders emphasized the family as the primary means by which future citizens would be imbued with political virtue.
Explanation D: D. Kerber does not claim the nation’s leaders proposed that the family would take over functions previously fulfilled by schools and churches.
Explanation E: E. Kerber does not attribute to the nation’s leaders the view that men and women would exercise equal roles in managing schools, churches, and the family.

### Passage:
In the Sonoran Desert of northwestern Mexico and southern Arizona, the flowers of several species of columnar cacti—cardon, saguaro, and organ pipe—were once exclusively pollinated at night by nectar-feeding bats, as their close relatives in arid tropical regions of southern Mexico still are. In these tropical regions, diurnal (daytime) visitors to columnar cactus flowers are ineffective pollinators because, by sunrise, the flowers’ stigmas become unreceptive or the flowers close. Yet the flowers of the Sonoran Desert cacti have evolved to remain open after sunrise, allowing pollination by such diurnal visitors as bees and birds. Why have these cacti expanded their range of pollinators by remaining open and receptive in daylight?  This development at the northernmost range of columnar cacti may be due to a yearly variation in the abundance—and hence the reliability—of migratory nectar-feeding bats. Pollinators can be unreliable for several reasons. They can be dietary generalists whose fidelity to a particular species depends on the availability of alternative food sources. Or they can be dietary specialists, but their abundance may vary widely from year to year, resulting in variable pollination of their preferred food species. Finally, they may be dietary specialists, but their abundance may be chronically low relative to the availability of flowers.  Recent data reveals that during spring in the Sonoran Desert, the nectar-feeding bats are specialists feeding on cardon, saguaro, and organ pipe flowers. However, whereas cactus-flower abundance tends to be high during spring, bat population densities tend to be low except near maternity roosts. Moreover, in spring, diurnal cactuspollinating birds are significantly more abundant in this region than are the nocturnal bats. Thus, with bats being unreliable cactus-flower pollinators, and daytime pollinators more abundant and therefore more reliable, selection favors the cactus flowers with traits that increase their range of pollinators. While data suggest that population densities of nectar-feeding bats are also low in tropical areas of southern Mexico, where bats are the exclusive pollinators of many species of columnar cacti, cactus-flower density and bat population density appear to be much more evenly balanced there: compared with the Sonoran Desert’s cardon and saguaro, columnar cacti in southern Mexico produce far fewer flowers per night. Accordingly, despite their low population density, bats are able to pollinate nearly 100 percent of the available flowers.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. compare the adaptive responses of several species of columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert with those in the arid tropical regions of southern Mexico
B: B. discuss some of the possible causes of the relatively low abundance of migratory nectar- feeding bats in the Sonoran Desert
C: C. provide a possible explanation for a particular evolutionary change in certain species of columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert
D: D. present recent findings that challenge a particular theory as to why several species of columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert have expanded their range of pollinators
E: E. compare the effectiveness of nocturnal and diurnal pollination for several different species of columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole. The first paragraph discusses an evolutionary change undergone by columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert with regard to pollination. The second paragraph offers a possible reason for this change— migratory nectar-feeding bats are unreliable pollinators—and the third paragraph goes on to provide evidence that supports the reason given in the second paragraph.
Explanation A: A. The passage does compare the adaptations of cacti in the Sonoran Desert with those of cacti in southern Mexico, but it does so in support of a larger point about the Sonoran Desert cacti.
Explanation B: B. The relatively low abundance of migratory nectar-feeding bats in the Sonoran Desert is important to the passage in that it provides a reason why the columnar cacti in that region have made certain adaptations. But the passage does not explain why the bats are not particularly abundant.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The flowers of the columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert have evolved to remain open after sunrise, and the passage is primarily concerned with explaining why this change may have taken place.
Explanation D: D. The passage presents recent findings that support, rather than challenge, a theory as to why the columnar cacti of the Sonoran Desert have expanded their range of pollinators. The passage does not allude to any competing theory that may be challenged by the findings.
Explanation E: E. Any comparison of the effectiveness of nocturnal and diurnal pollination for columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert is made in support of the passage’s primary concern: explaining why these cacti have come to remain open and receptive to pollination in daylight.

In the Sonoran Desert of northwestern Mexico and southern Arizona, the flowers of several species of columnar cacti—cardon, saguaro, and organ pipe—were once exclusively pollinated at night by nectar-feeding bats, as their close relatives in arid tropical regions of southern Mexico still are.

Yet the flowers of the Sonoran Desert cacti have evolved to remain open after sunrise, allowing pollination by such diurnal visitors as bees and birds. Why have these cacti expanded their range of pollinators by remaining open and receptive in daylight?  This development at the northernmost range of columnar cacti may be due to a yearly variation in the abundance—and hence the reliability—of migratory nectar-feeding bats. Pollinators can be unreliable for several reasons. They can be dietary generalists whose fidelity to a particular species depends on the availability of alternative food sources. Or they can be dietary specialists, but their abundance may vary widely from year to year, resulting in variable pollination of their preferred food species.

Accordingly, despite their low population density, bats are able to pollinate nearly 100 percent of the available flowers.

### Question:
According to the passage, which of the following types of nectar-feeding pollinators is likely to be an unreliable pollinator of a particular cactus flower?
A: A. A dietary specialist whose abundance is typically high in relation to that of the flower
B: B. A dietary specialist whose abundance is at times significantly lower than that of the flower
C: C. A dietary generalist for whom that flower’s nectar is not a preferred food but is the most consistently available food
D: D. A dietary generalist for whom that flower’s nectar is slightly preferred to other available foods
E: E. A dietary generalist that evolved from a species of dietary specialists

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question depends on recognizing the qualities of an unreliable pollinator, as described in the passage. The second paragraph addresses this issue, as it explains that the unreliability of pollinators can arise in any of three ways: they may be dietary generalists with alternative sources of food; they may be dietary specialists whose own abundance varies; or they may be dietary specialists whose abundance is chronically low in relation to the flowers.
Explanation A: A. A dietary specialist whose abundance is high in relation to the flowers on which it feeds would likely be a reliable pollinator.
Explanation B: B. Correct. A dietary specialist whose abundance is at times significantly lower than that of the flower it pollinates would be, according to the passage, unreliable.
Explanation C: C. A dietary generalist who finds the flower of a particular species more consistently available than other suitable food sources would most likely be a reliable pollinator of that flower.
Explanation D: D. A dietary generalist who prefers the flower’s nectar would likely be a reliable pollinator of that flower compared to other flowers.
Explanation E: E. The passage provides no reason to believe that the evolution of a pollinator’s dietary preference has any bearing on its reliability as a pollinator.

Yet the flowers of the Sonoran Desert cacti have evolved to remain open after sunrise, allowing pollination by such diurnal visitors as bees and birds. Why have these cacti expanded their range of pollinators by remaining open and receptive in daylight?  This development at the northernmost range of columnar cacti may be due to a yearly variation in the abundance—and hence the reliability—of migratory nectar-feeding bats. Pollinators can be unreliable for several reasons. They can be dietary generalists whose fidelity to a particular species depends on the availability of alternative food sources.

### Question:
According to the passage, present-day columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert differ from their close relatives in southern Mexico in that the Sonoran cacti
A: A. have flowers that remain open after sunset
B: B. are pollinated primarily by dietary specialists
C: C. can be pollinated by nectar-feeding bats
D: D. have stigmas that are unreceptive to pollination at night
E: E. are sometimes pollinated by diurnal pollinators

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question depends on identifying a difference noted in the passage between columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert and their relatives in southern Mexico. The first paragraph states that in southern Mexico, columnar cactus flowers are not receptive to pollination by diurnal pollinators, whereas in the Sonoran Desert, the flowers have evolved to allow diurnal pollination.
Explanation A: A. The cacti in both the Sonoran Desert and southern Mexico have flowers that remain open after sunset, because cacti in both locations can be pollinated nocturnally.
Explanation B: B. Sonoran Desert cacti are pollinated, at least partially, by nectar-feeding bats, which are dietary specialists. But the cacti in southern Mexico are pollinated by these specialists, too.
Explanation C: C. Sonoran Desert cacti can be pollinated by nectar-feeding bats—but so can cacti in southern Mexico.
Explanation D: D. Cacti in the Sonoran Desert have stigmas that have evolved to be receptive to pollination both at night and during the day.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The distinction between cacti in the Sonoran Desert and those in southern Mexico is that Sonoran Desert cacti have evolved to allow pollination during the day— that is, pollination by diurnal pollinators.

### Passage:
Manufacturers have to do more than build large manufacturing plants to realize economies of scale. It is true that as the capacity of a manufacturing operation rises, costs per unit of output fall as plant size approaches “minimum efficient scale,” where the cost per unit of output reaches a minimum, determined roughly by the state of existing technology and size of the potential market. However, minimum efficient scale cannot be fully realized unless a steady “throughput” (the flow of materials through a plant) is attained. The throughput needed to maintain the optimal scale of production requires careful coordination not only of the flow of goods through the production process, but also of the flow of input from suppliers and the flow of output to wholesalers and final consumers. If throughput falls below a critical point, unit costs rise sharply and profits disappear. A manufacturer’s fixed costs and “sunk costs” (original capital investment in the physical plant) do not decrease when production declines due to inadequate supplies of raw materials, problems on the factory floor, or inefficient sales networks. Consequently, potential economies of scale are based on the physical and engineering characteristics of the production facilities—that is, on tangible capital—but realized economies of scale are operational and organizational, and depend on knowledge, skills, experience, and teamwork—that is, on organized human capabilities, or intangible capital.  The importance of investing in intangible capital becomes obvious when one looks at what happens in new capital-intensive manufacturing industries. Such industries are quickly dominated, not by the first firms to acquire technologically sophisticated plants of theoretically optimal size, but rather by the first to exploit the full potential of such plants. Once some firms achieve this, a market becomes extremely hard to enter. Challengers must construct comparable plants and do so after the first movers have already worked out problems with suppliers or with new production processes. Challengers must create distribution networks and marketing systems in markets where first movers have all the contacts and know-how. And challengers must recruit management teams to compete with those that have already mastered these functional and strategic activities.

### Question:
The passage suggests that in order for a manufacturer in a capital-intensive industry to have a decisive advantage over competitors making similar products, the manufacturer must
A: A. be the first in the industry to build production facilities of theoretically optimal size
B: B. make every effort to keep fixed and sunk costs as low as possible
C: C. be one of the first to operate its manufacturing plants at minimum efficient scale
D: D. produce goods of higher quality than those produced by direct competitors
E: E. stockpile raw materials at production sites in order to ensure a steady flow of such materials

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question asks for an inference about what a manufacturer in a capital-intensive industry must do to have an advantage over competitors making similar products. The passage addresses this question by stating that advantage accrues to those firms that are the first to exploit the full potential of optimally sized, technologically sophisticated plants. In this context, exploiting the full potential of such plants means operating them at minimum efficient scale. Based on the definition in the first paragraph, this means that the plant must have an output of such a size that the cost per unit of output is at a minimum.
Explanation A: A. The passage says that for new capital-intensive firms to dominate the market, it is not enough for them to have optimally sized plants; the plants must also be operated in a way that fully exploits their potential.
Explanation B: B. While keeping fixed and sunk costs low would obviously help keep overall costs low, the passage does not suggest that this is decisive in enabling a firm to have an advantage over competitors.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Being among the first manufacturers to operate plants at minimum efficient scale means that those plants are being exploited to their full potential. This strategy would most likely give such manufacturers a decisive advantage over new firms hoping to compete effectively.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not discuss the quality of goods made by manufacturers.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not suggest that stockpiling raw materials is the most efficient way to ensure a steady flow of raw materials into the manufacturing process, though the passage states that such a steady flow is a factor in achieving minimum efficient scale.

Challengers must create distribution networks and marketing systems in markets where first movers have all the contacts and know-how. And challengers must recruit management teams to compete with those that have already mastered these functional and strategic activities.

### Question:
The passage suggests that which of the following is true of a manufacturer’s fixed and sunk costs?
A: A. The extent to which they are determined by market conditions for the goods being manufactured is frequently underestimated.
B: B. If they are kept as low as possible, the manufacturer is very likely to realize significant profits.
C: C. They are the primary factor that determines whether a manufacturer will realize economies of scale.
D: D. They should be on a par with the fixed and sunk costs of the manufacturer’s competitors.
E: E. They are not affected by fluctuations in a manufacturing plant’s throughput.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question asks about what the passage implies about fixed and sunk costs. The passage states that when production declines due to certain factors, such costs remain at the same level (which may be high), and the cost per unit produced (unit costs) rises sharply.
Explanation A: A. The passage discusses the impact of market conditions on determining what the optimal size of a manufacturing plant is (which affects fixed and sunk costs). But it makes no claim about the frequency with which such an impact is “underestimated.”
Explanation B: B. The passage emphasizes that failing to keep throughput at an efficiently high level reduces profitability because that failure results in increased cost per unit (to which, of course, the plant’s fixed and sunk costs contribute). But the passage does not claim that keeping aggregate fixed and sunk costs very low is necessary in order to have the most competitive production operation.
Explanation C: C. The passage emphasizes that the crucial factor in achieving economies of scale is efficient operation of the production facilities, not the size of the firm’s fixed and sunk costs (even though such costs are clearly in part determined by the size and design of the production facilities).
Explanation D: D. While a manufacturer’s fixed and sunk costs may be on a par with those of the manufacturer’s competitors, the passage provides no grounds for inferring that there is any need for them to be (for example, physical plants that employ different technologies may have different price tags).
Explanation E: E. Correct. According to the passage, throughput refers to the flow of materials through a plant. This flow can vary as a result of various factors, but fixed and sunk costs—financial resources already committed—remain the same regardless of such variation.

Evaluation This question asks about the rhetorical function of the second paragraph. While the first paragraph argues that a crucial factor in achieving economies of scale is intangible capital, or organized human capabilities, the second paragraph uses the example of new capital-intensive manufacturing industries to help show that this is indeed the case.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The second paragraph provides an example that illustrates the claims made in the first paragraph. It discusses the way in which intangible capital—e.g., distribution networks, marketing systems, smooth production processes, and qualified management teams—enables manufacturers in new capital-intensive manufacturing industries to realize economies of scale and achieve market dominance.
Explanation B: B. The second paragraph does, in a sense, “evaluate” investment in intangible capital: it suggests that such investment is necessary. However, investment in intangible capital is the only strategy it discusses.
Explanation C: C. The second paragraph supports rather than undermines the first paragraph’s argument.
Explanation D: D. Nothing in the second paragraph suggests that there are, or could be, any objections to the first paragraph’s argument.
Explanation E: E. The second paragraph discusses the potential positive outcomes of investing in intangible capital. It suggests that there might be negative consequences to not making such investments, but it does not indicate that avoiding such investments is a commonly used strategy.

### Question:
The passage LEAST supports the inference that a manufacturer’s throughput could be adversely affected by
A: A. a mistake in judgment regarding the selection of a wholesaler
B: B. a breakdown in the factory’s machinery
C: C. a labor dispute on the factory floor
D: D. an increase in the cost per unit of output
E: E. a drop in the efficiency of the sales network

### Response:
<think>
Application This question may be best approached by using an elimination strategy—first finding the four choices that can reasonably be inferred from the passage, and then checking to make sure that the remaining choice cannot reasonably be inferred. This requires understanding the information the passage gives about throughput, then making inferences about what can cause throughput to drop. The passage defines throughput generally as the flow of materials through a plant and goes on to explain that it involves coordination of the production process itself, as well as obtaining materials from suppliers and marketing and distributing the manufactured products. Anything that damages this flow of materials and products would be said to have an adverse effect on throughput.
Explanation A: A. Making a poor judgment about a wholesaler would most likely have an adverse effect on throughput, in that it could affect the flow of output to wholesalers and final consumers.
Explanation B: B. A breakdown in machinery would likely fall into the category of problems on the factory floor mentioned in the passage and would likely prove damaging to throughput because of its effect on the production process itself.
Explanation C: C. A labor dispute would also likely fall into the category of problems on the factory floor mentioned in the passage and would probably cause a decline in production and thus adversely affect throughput.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage emphasizes that changes in throughput can cause increases or decreases in costs per unit. But the passage is not committed to any claims about how changes in costs per unit might affect throughput.
Explanation E: E. The passage suggests that inefficient sales networks could cause a decline in production. Thus, a decrease in sales efficiency would most likely adversely affect a manufacturer’s ability to provide goods to consumers, and therefore would create problems with throughput.

A manufacturer’s fixed costs and “sunk costs” (original capital investment in the physical plant) do not decrease when production declines due to inadequate supplies of raw materials, problems on the factory floor, or inefficient sales networks. Consequently, potential economies of scale are based on the physical and engineering characteristics of the production facilities—that is, on tangible capital—but realized economies of scale are operational and organizational, and depend on knowledge, skills, experience, and teamwork—that is, on organized human capabilities, or intangible capital.  The importance of investing in intangible capital becomes obvious when one looks at what happens in new capital-intensive manufacturing industries. Such industries are quickly dominated, not by the first firms to acquire technologically sophisticated plants of theoretically optimal size, but rather by the first to exploit the full potential of such plants. Once some firms achieve this, a market becomes extremely hard to enter. Challengers must construct comparable plants and do so after the first movers have already worked out problems with suppliers or with new production processes. Challengers must create distribution networks and marketing systems in markets where first movers have all the contacts and know-how. And challengers must recruit management teams to compete with those that have already mastered these functional and strategic activities.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. point out the importance of intangible capital for realizing economies of scale in manufacturing
B: B. show that manufacturers frequently gain a competitive advantage from investment in large manufacturing facilities
C: C. argue that large manufacturing facilities often fail because of inadequate investment in both tangible and intangible capital
D: D. suggest that most new industries are likely to be dominated by firms that build large manufacturing plants early
E: E. explain why large manufacturing plants usually do not help manufacturers achieve economies of scale

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole. In general, it makes an argument for investing in intangible capital as a way for manufacturers to realize economies of scale, and it supports its argument with an example.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage focuses on intangible capital as a crucial factor in realizing economies of scale.
Explanation B: B. According to the passage, manufacturers gain competitive advantage by building plants of optimal size that they then fully exploit; nothing in the passage suggests that large plants are frequently optimal.
Explanation C: C. The passage assumes that manufacturers invest appropriately in tangible capital and argues that it is important for them to invest in intangible capital as well.
Explanation D: D. The passage states that new capital-intensive manufacturing industries are dominated not by firms that are the first to build large plants, but by firms that exploit the full potential of their plants.
Explanation E: E. The passage indicates that economies of scale can be achieved in plants of optimal size. The passage does not suggest that large plants cannot be optimal.

### Passage:
A small number of the forest species of lepidoptera (moths and butterflies, which exist as caterpillars during most of their life cycle) exhibit regularly recurring patterns of population growth and decline—such fluctuations in population are known as population cycles. Although many different variables influence population levels, a regular pattern such as a population cycle seems to imply a dominant, driving force. Identification of that driving force, however, has proved surprisingly elusive despite considerable research. The common approach of studying causes of population cycles by measuring the mortality caused by different agents, such as predatory birds or parasites, has been unproductive in the case of lepidoptera. Moreover, population ecologists’ attempts to alter cycles by changing the caterpillars’ habitat and by reducing caterpillar populations have not succeeded. In short, the evidence implies that these insect populations, if not self-regulating, may at least be regulated by an agent more intimately connected with the insect than are predatory birds or parasites.  Recent work suggests that this agent may be a virus. For many years, viral disease had been reported in declining populations of caterpillars, but population ecologists had usually considered viral disease to have contributed to the decline once it was underway rather than to have initiated it. The recent work has been made possible by new techniques of molecular biology that allow viral DNA to be detected at low concentrations in the environment. Nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are hypothesized to be the driving force behind population cycles in lepidoptera in part because the viruses themselves follow an infectious cycle in which, if protected from direct sunlight, they may remain virulent for many years in the environment, embedded in durable crystals of polyhedrin protein. Once ingested by a caterpillar, the crystals dissolve, releasing the virus to infect the insect’s cells. Late in the course of the infection, millions of new virus particles are formed and enclosed in polyhedrin crystals. These crystals reenter the environment after the insect dies and decomposes, thus becoming available to infect other caterpillars.  One of the attractions of this hypothesis is its broad applicability. Remarkably, despite significant differences in habitat and behavior, many species of lepidoptera have population cycles of similar length, between eight and eleven years. Nuclear polyhedrosis viral infection is one factor these disparate species share.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. describe the development of new techniques that may help to determine the driving force behind population cycles in lepidoptera
B: B. present evidence that refutes a particular theory about the driving force behind population cycles in lepidoptera
C: C. present a hypothesis about the driving force behind population cycles in lepidoptera
D: D. describe the fluctuating patterns of population cycles in lepidoptera
E: E. question the idea that a single driving force is behind population cycles in lepidoptera

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole in order to identify its purpose. The first paragraph defines population cycles of lepidoptera and discusses some ways those cycles have been studied. It suggests that a particular agent may regulate these cycles. The second paragraph describes a candidate for this agent: nuclear polyhedrosis viruses. The third paragraph explains why this hypothesis is compelling.
Explanation A: A. The passage mentions new techniques in molecular biology, but it does so in order to explain why a particular candidate for the agent behind population cycles has come to light.
Explanation B: B. The theory the passage presents is that there is a driving force behind lepidoptera population cycles. It does not refute this theory; rather, it offers a convincing case for nuclear polyhedrosis viruses as that force. It also discusses some previous approaches to seeking plausible hypotheses but does not focus on refuting any particular hypothesis.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage is primarily concerned with presenting the hypothesis that nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are the driving force behind lepidoptera population cycles.
Explanation D: D. The first paragraph describes the fluctuating patterns of lepidoptera population cycles, but it does so to explain what population cycles are, so that it can then go on to attempt to account for those cycles.
Explanation E: E. The passage is concerned with making a case for nuclear polyhedrosis viruses as the driving force behind at least some lepidoptera population cycles, not with questioning the idea that there is a driving force.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that the mortality caused by agents such as predatory birds or parasites was measured in an attempt to
A: A. develop an explanation for the existence of lepidoptera population cycles
B: B. identify behavioral factors in lepidoptera that affect survival rates
C: C. identify possible methods for controlling lepidoptera population growth
D: D. provide evidence that lepidoptera populations are self-regulating
E: E. determine the life stages of lepidoptera at which mortality rates are highest

### Response:
<think>
Inference The passage states that mortality caused by various agents, birds and parasites among them, was measured because this was the common approach to studying causes of population cycles. This in turn suggests that those scientists engaged in such measuring in the case of lepidoptera were attempting to come up with a definitive explanation for why those lepidoptera population cycles occurred.
Explanation A: A. Correct. Measuring mortality caused by various agents was part of the attempt to determine the driving force behind lepidoptera population cycles.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not indicate that behavioral factors in lepidoptera are related to their mortality as caused by agents such as predatory birds or parasites.
Explanation C: C. The passage is concerned not with controlling lepidoptera population growth, but rather with determining why population cycles occur.
Explanation D: D. According to the information in the passage, scientists sought to measure mortality caused by particular agents in order to determine the driving force behind lepidoptera population cycles. In suggesting that mortality caused by these agents is not that force, the measurements may have indicated that the cycles could be self-regulating, but they were not undertaken in order to provide such evidence.
Explanation E: E. The passage discusses mortality primarily in the caterpillar stage and does not suggest that any research was directed toward comparing caterpillar mortality rates with mortality rates in other life stages of the insects.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the author’s conclusion in lines 18–22?
A: A. New research reveals that the number of species of birds and parasites that prey on lepidoptera has dropped significantly in recent years.
B: B. New experiments in which the habitats of lepidoptera are altered in previously untried ways result in the shortening of lepidoptera population cycles.
C: C. Recent experiments have revealed that the nuclear polyhedrosis virus is present in a number of predators and parasites of lepidoptera.
D: D. Differences among the habitats of lepidoptera species make it difficult to assess the effects of weather on lepidoptera population cycles.
E: E. Viral disease is typically observed in a large proportion of the lepidoptera population.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation The sentence in question presents the author’s conclusion that lepidoptera populations may be self-regulating or regulated by something more closely connected to the insects than predatory birds or parasites are. To weaken that conclusion requires weakening its support, namely, that mortality caused by predators and parasites seems not to affect population cycles, and that changing habitats and reducing populations has not altered population cycles either.
Explanation A: A. A drop in birds and parasites preying on lepidoptera would not weaken the author’s conclusion; mortality caused by these predators has not affected population cycles.
Explanation B: B. Correct. New experiments involving changes in habitat that did succeed in altering population cycles would suggest that the populations are not in fact self-regulating, and that the search for another cycle-altering agent may be unnecessary.
Explanation C: C. This finding would support the idea that the nuclear polyhedrosis virus is responsible for population cycles—that is, that the virus is the closely connected agent the author concludes is responsible.
Explanation D: D. The suggestion that the effects of weather may not have been adequately assessed is remotely relevant to the author’s conclusion, but the mere difficulty of assessing the effects provides no positive reason to suppose that weather may be the cause of the cycles. On the other hand, answer choice B does offer evidence for an alternative explanation.
Explanation E: E. Viral disease is what the author ultimately suggests is the agent that drives the lepidoptera population cycles in question. The wide presence of viruses in lepidoptera could help support the author’s conclusion.

Supporting Idea This question addresses what the passage states directly about population ecologists’ beliefs regarding viral diseases prior to the discovery of new viral DNA–detection techniques. The second paragraph of the passage states that these ecologists believed viral disease contributed to population decline that was already underway rather than initiating it.
Explanation A: A. The second paragraph states that viral disease had been reported; thus, population ecologists were aware of its existence in insect populations. The passage is consistent with ecologists having believed that it was prevalent.
Explanation B: B. The passage focuses mainly on the caterpillar life stage of lepidoptera, but there is nothing to suggest that scientists held particular beliefs regarding viral diseases’ restriction to that life stage.
Explanation C: C. It is after, not before, the discovery of new techniques for detecting viral DNA when populations ecologists came to believe that such diseases were the driving force behind the population cycles.
Explanation D: D. Correct. As stated in the passage, population ecologists believed that viral diseases contributed to already occurring population decline.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The passage states in the second paragraph that these viruses remain virulent for many years if they are protected from direct sunlight. They are embedded in crystals of polyhedrin protein.
Explanation A: A. The viruses remain virulent partially because of their being contained in polyhedrin protein crystals. They would most likely not remain virulent if those crystals dissolved.
Explanation B: B. The viruses remain virulent even when caterpillar populations are not in decline; that is how the viruses initiate new population declines.
Explanation C: C. According to the passage, viral DNA has been detected in the environment at low concentrations, yet the viruses are still virulent. Thus, they need not be present in large numbers.
Explanation D: D. Nothing in the passage indicates that the concentration of these viruses must be low for them to be virulent.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that while inside its polyhedrin protein crystals, the nuclear polyhedrosis virus
A: A. is exposed to direct sunlight
B: B. is attractive to predators
C: C. cannot infect caterpillars’ cells
D: D. cannot be ingested by caterpillars
E: E. cannot be detected by new techniques of molecular biology

### Response:
<think>
Inference The passage indicates that the polyhedrin protein crystals protect the nuclear polyhedrosis virus when it is in the environment. When a caterpillar ingests those crystals, they dissolve. That releases the virus, whereupon it infects the caterpillar’s cells. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the virus must be released from the crystals before it can infect the caterpillar.
Explanation A: A. The passage states that nuclear polyhedrosis viruses remain embedded in polyhedrin protein crystals if protected from direct sunlight, not that the virus is exposed to light when it is in the protein crystals.
Explanation B: B. Nothing in the passage indicates that any organism preys on the virus itself or that it attracts predators to caterpillars that it infects.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The virus must be released from the crystals before it can infect caterpillars’ cells.
Explanation D: D. The passage states that caterpillars ingest the polyhedrin protein crystals.
Explanation E: E. According to the passage, new techniques of molecular biology enable the detection of viral DNA in the environment. The nuclear polyhedrosis virus persists in the environment inside protein crystals. The passage suggests that the new techniques are able to detect the virus inside its crystals but does not provide any evidence about whether they detect it directly or infer its presence indirectly.

### Passage:
Resin is a plant secretion that hardens when exposed to air; fossilized resin is called amber. Although Pliny in the first century recognized that amber was produced from “marrow discharged by trees,” amber has been widely misunderstood to be a semiprecious gem and has even been described in mineralogy textbooks. Confusion also persists surrounding the term “resin,” which was defined before rigorous chemical analyses were available. Resin is often confused with gum, a substance produced in plants in response to bacterial infections, and with sap, an aqueous solution transported through certain plant tissues. Resin differs from both gum and sap in that scientists have not determined a physiological function for resin.  In the 1950s, entomologists posited that resin may function to repel or attract insects. Fraenkel conjectured that plants initially produced resin in nonspecific chemical responses to insect attack and that, over time, plants evolved that produced resin with specific repellent effects. But some insect species, he noted, might overcome the repellent effects, actually becoming attracted to the resin. This might induce the insects to feed on those plants or aid them in securing a breeding site. Later researchers suggested that resin mediates the complex interdependence, or “coevolution,” of plants and insects over time. Such ideas led to the development of the specialized discipline of chemical ecology, which is concerned with the role of plant chemicals in interactions with other organisms and with the evolution and ecology of plant antiherbivore chemistry (plants’ chemical defenses against attack by herbivores such as insects).

### Question:
According to the passage, which of the following is true of plant antiherbivore chemistry?
A: A. Changes in a plant’s antiherbivore chemistry may affect insect feeding behavior.
B: B. A plant’s repellent effects often involve interactions between gum and resin.
C: C. A plant’s antiherbivore responses assist in combating bacterial infections.
D: D. Plant antiherbivore chemistry plays only a minor role in the coevolution of plants and insects.
E: E. Researchers first studied repellent effects in plants beginning in the 1950s.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question addresses what the information in the passage indicates about plant antiherbivore chemistry—that is, plants’ chemical defenses against herbivore attacks. The second paragraph of the passage cites the views of various scientists regarding the possible role of resin in antiherbivore chemistry; plants could have evolved resin specifically to repel insects.
Explanation A: A. Correct. According to the second paragraph, various scientists have suggested that a change in antiherbivore chemistry, here specifically involving resin, could repel insects; alternatively, some insects could have been attracted to resin, feeding more heavily on plants that produced it. Other researchers have suggested that even if resin does not directly repel or attract insects, it may indirectly affect insect-feeding behavior by mediating changes in plants’ antiherbivore chemistry.
Explanation B: B. The first paragraph states that plants produce gum in response to bacterial infections. Although this does not rule out the hypothesis that gum also contributes to plants’ antiherbivore chemistry, the passage provides no evidence that it does so.
Explanation C: C. According to the passage, a plant’s antiherbivore responses have developed to combat predators, such as insects, that eat plants. The passage provides no evidence that such responses also combat bacterial infections.
Explanation D: D. The second paragraph indicates that plant antiherbivore chemistry plays a major role in the discipline of chemical ecology, and chemical ecology concerns itself with coevolution of plants and insects.
Explanation E: E. According to the passage, it was in the 1950s that entomologists began discussing resin’s possible role in repelling and attracting insects. The passage does not suggest that this marked the beginning of their study of repellent effects more generally.

Resin is a plant secretion that hardens when exposed to air; fossilized resin is called amber. Although Pliny in the first century recognized that amber was produced from “marrow discharged by trees,” amber has been widely misunderstood to be a semiprecious gem and has even been described in mineralogy textbooks. Confusion also persists surrounding the term “resin,” which was defined before rigorous chemical analyses were available. Resin is often confused with gum, a substance produced in plants in response to bacterial infections, and with sap, an aqueous solution transported through certain plant tissues. Resin differs from both gum and sap in that scientists have not determined a physiological function for resin.  In the 1950s, entomologists posited that resin may function to repel or attract insects. Fraenkel conjectured that plants initially produced resin in nonspecific chemical responses to insect attack and that, over time, plants evolved that produced resin with specific repellent effects. But some insect species, he noted, might overcome the repellent effects, actually becoming attracted to the resin. This might induce the insects to feed on those plants or aid them in securing a breeding site. Later researchers suggested that resin mediates the complex interdependence, or “coevolution,” of plants and insects over time. Such ideas led to the development of the specialized discipline of chemical ecology, which is concerned with the role of plant chemicals in interactions with other organisms and with the evolution and ecology of plant antiherbivore chemistry (plants’ chemical defenses against attack by herbivores such as insects).

### Question:
Of the following topics, which would be most likely to be studied within the discipline of chemical ecology as it is described in the passage?
A: A. Seeds that become attached to certain insects, which in turn carry away the seeds and aid in the reproductive cycle of the plant species in question
B: B. An insect species that feeds on weeds detrimental to crop health and yield, and how these insects might aid in agricultural production
C: C. The effects of deforestation on the life cycles of subtropical carnivorous plants and the insect species on which the plants feed
D: D. The growth patterns of a particular species of plant that has proved remarkably resistant to herbicides
E: E. Insects that develop a tolerance for feeding on a plant that had previously been toxic to them, and the resultant changes within that plant species

### Response:
<think>
Application The discipline of chemical ecology, as it is described in the passage, deals with how plants use chemicals to interact with other organisms—in particular, how they defend against attack— and how those interactions have evolved. To be studied within that discipline, a specific topic would need to address some aspect of that chemical interaction.
Explanation A: A. The passage provides no reason to suppose that the topic of seeds and how they travel would be studied within chemical ecology, given that it does not discuss how chemicals might be involved in the reproductive cycle.
Explanation B: B. The passage provides no indication that chemical ecology would be concerned with how weed-destroying insects would aid agricultural production.
Explanation C: C. The passage provides no indication that deforestation would involve plant chemicals or that its effects would be studied in chemical ecology.
Explanation D: D. The passage provides no indication that a plant’s resistance to herbicides would be studied in chemical ecology, but the passage does suggest that the focus of chemical ecology is on how plants chemically interact with other organisms.
Explanation E: E. Correct. Chemical ecology developed to deal with the interdependence between plants and insects. Insects’ developing a tolerance for feeding on a once-toxic plant, and the plants’ resultant changes, is a situation of just such interdependence: plants and insects coevolving.

### Question:
The author refers to “bacterial infections” (see line 11) most likely in order to
A: A. describe the physiological function that gum performs in plants
B: B. demonstrate that sap is not the only substance that is transported through a plant’s tissues
C: C. explain how modern chemical analysis has been used to clarify the function of resin
D: D. show that gum cannot serve as an effective defense against herbivores
E: E. give an example of how confusion has arisen with regard to the nature of resin

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation The author mentions bacterial infections in the first paragraph as the reason why plants produce the substance known as gum.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The author states directly that plants produce gum in response to bacterial infections.
Explanation B: B. The author states directly that sap is transported through plant tissues. The passage does not address the question of whether bacterial infections or anything related to them are similarly transported.
Explanation C: C. The passage indicates that rigorous chemical analysis is now available, but scientists still do not know resin’s function. The reference to bacterial infections is related to gum, not resin.
Explanation D: D. The reference to bacterial infections indicates the actual purpose served by gum; it does not function to show ways in which gum is inadequate.
Explanation E: E. Gum itself serves as an example of the confusion surrounding the nature of resin; bacterial infections, to which gum production is a response, do not serve as that example.

E: E. demonstrate that Pliny believed amber to be a mineral

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation The passage states generally that amber has been widely misunderstood but cites Pliny as noting correctly, in the first century, that amber resulted from a substance discharged by trees.
Explanation A: A. Pliny’s observation was, according to the author, accurate and not a misunderstanding.
Explanation B: B. The author equates confusion about amber with confusion about resin; the reference to Pliny does not indicate which of the two, amber or resin, has been more widely misunderstood.
Explanation C: C. The author indicates that others, not Pliny, mischaracterized amber as a semiprecious gem—and when that mischaracterization first occurred is not identified.
Explanation D: D. Correct. Pliny’s recognition that amber came from a substance discharged by trees stands, in the author’s account, as an exception to the widespread incorrect identifications of the substance.
Explanation E: E. Others held the belief that amber was a mineral. The passage indicates that Pliny recognized that amber came from trees but provides no evidence that he also considered it a mineral.

### Passage:
During the 1980s, many economic historians studying Latin America focused on the impact of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Most of these historians argued that although the Depression began earlier in Latin America than in the United States, it was less severe in Latin America and did not significantly impede industrial growth there. The historians’ argument was grounded in national government records concerning tax revenues and exports and in government-sponsored industrial censuses, from which historians have drawn conclusions about total manufacturing output and profit levels across Latin America. However, economic statistics published by Latin American governments in the early twentieth century are neither reliable nor consistent; this is especially true of manufacturing data, which were gathered from factory owners for taxation purposes and which therefore may well be distorted. Moreover, one cannot assume a direct correlation between the output level and the profit level of a given industry, as these variables often move in opposite directions. Finally, national and regional economies are composed of individual firms and industries, and relying on general, sweeping economic indicators may mask substantial variations among these different enterprises. For example, recent analyses of previously unexamined data on textile manufacturing in Brazil and Mexico suggest that the Great Depression had a more severe impact on this Latin American industry than scholars had recognized.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. compare the impact of the Great Depression on Latin America with its impact on the United States
B: B. criticize a school of economic historians for failing to analyze the Great Depression in Latin America within a global context
C: C. illustrate the risks inherent in comparing different types of economic enterprises to explain economic phenomena
D: D. call into question certain scholars’ views concerning the severity of the Great Depression in Latin America
E: E. demonstrate that the Great Depression had a more severe impact on industry in Latin American than in certain other regions Main Idea This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole. The passage first describes the view of many economic historians of the 1980s. It next describes the evidence on which that view is based. The remainder of the passage raises issues about the rationale for that view.

### Response:

Explanation A: A. The comparison between Latin America and the United States is only a small part of a larger argument analyzing studies of the Great Depression in Latin America.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not discuss a global context for the Great Depression.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not primarily aim to illustrate risks that may be generally inherent in explaining economic phenomena.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage claims that certain scholars underestimate the severity of the Great Depression in Latin America.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not claim that the impact of the Great Depression on Latin American industry was generally more severe than its impact on industry elsewhere.

### Passage:
During the 1980s, many economic historians studying Latin America focused on the impact of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Most of these historians argued that although the Depression began earlier in Latin America than in the United States, it was less severe in Latin America and did not significantly impede industrial growth there. The historians’ argument was grounded in national government records concerning tax revenues and exports and in government-sponsored industrial censuses, from which historians have drawn conclusions about total manufacturing output and profit levels across Latin America. However, economic statistics published by Latin American governments in the early twentieth century are neither reliable nor consistent; this is especially true of manufacturing data, which were gathered from factory owners for taxation purposes and which therefore may well be distorted. Moreover, one cannot assume a direct correlation between the output level and the profit level of a given industry, as these variables often move in opposite directions.

For example, recent analyses of previously unexamined data on textile manufacturing in Brazil and Mexico suggest that the Great Depression had a more severe impact on this Latin American industry than scholars had recognized.

### Question:
Which of the following conclusions about the Great Depression is best supported by the passage?
A: A. It did not impede Latin American industrial growth as much as historians had previously thought.
B: B. It had a more severe impact on the Brazilian and the Mexican textile industries than it had on Latin America as a region.
C: C. It affected the Latin American textile industry more severely than it did any other industry in Latin America.
D: D. The overall impact on Latin American industrial growth should be reevaluated by economic historians.
E: E. Its impact on Latin America should not be compared with its impact on the United States.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question asks which conclusion is most strongly supported by the passage. The passage presents the rationale of some historians for their conclusion that the Great Depression did not significantly interfere with economic growth in Latin America. It then critiques that rationale and conclusion. By questioning the historians’ claims, the passage suggests that a reevaluation of the Great Depression’s effect on Latin America is needed.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not significantly support this. The passage indicates that, in fact, the Great Depression impeded Latin American economic development more than some historians had thought.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not significantly support this. The passage does not compare the impact on the Brazilian and Mexican textile industries to the impact on the Latin American region.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not significantly support this. The passage does not compare the effect of the Great Depression on the textile industry to its effect on other industries.
Explanation D: D. Correct. As presented in the passage, the passage author’s critique of the historians’ rationale for their claims provides significant support for the conclusion that their claims should be reevaluated.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not significantly support the claim that the comparison in question should not be made.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the author’s assertion regarding economic indicators in lines 25–27?
A: A. During an economic depression, European textile manufacturers’ profits rise while their industrial output remains steady.
B: B. During a national economic recession, United States microchips manufacturers’ profits rise sharply while United States steel manufacturers’ profits plunge.
C: C. During the years following a severe economic depression, textile manufacturers’ output levels and profit levels increase in Brazil and Mexico but not in the rest of Latin America.
D: D. Although Japanese industry as a whole recovers after an economic recession, it does not regain its previously high levels of production.
E: E. While European industrial output increases in the years following an economic depression, total output remains below that of Japan or the United States.

### Response:
<think>
Application The question involves applying information from outside the passage to a claim made by the author. The text in lines 25–27 asserts that broad economic indicators pertaining to a nation or region can obscure differences between individual firms or industries within that nation or region. The question asks which evidence would most strengthen the support for that conclusion.
Explanation A: A. This refers only to the relationship between a single industry’s profits and its output, not to general economic indicators.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The phrase a national recession refers to a general economic indicator. Suppose that in a situation described as a national recession, one industry (microchip manufacturing) prospers while another industry (steel manufacturing) does not. This would provide some additional support, over and above that given in the passage, for the assertion that broad economic indicators may mask differences between industries.
Explanation C: C. Economic differences between countries do not strengthen the support for the author’s assertion regarding variations among different firms and industries in one country or region.
Explanation D: D. This has no obvious bearing on how sweeping economic indicators can mask differences between industries or enterprises in a single country or region.
Explanation E: E. A comparison of different countries does not pertain to the assertion regarding variation among firms and industries in the same country.

### Passage:
Among the myths taken as fact by the environmental managers of most corporations is the belief that environmental regulations affect all competitors in a given industry uniformly. In reality, regulatory costs—and therefore compliance— fall unevenly, economically disadvantaging some companies and benefiting others. For example, a plant situated near a number of larger noncompliant competitors is less likely to attract the attention of local regulators than is an isolated plant, and less attention means lower costs.  Additionally, large plants can spread compliance costs such as waste treatment across a larger revenue base; on the other hand, some smaller plants may not even be subject to certain provisions such as permit or reporting requirements by virtue of their size. Finally, older production technologies often continue to generate toxic wastes that were not regulated when the technology was first adopted. New regulations have imposed extensive compliance costs on companies still using older industrial coal-fired burners that generate high sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs, for example, whereas new facilities generally avoid processes that would create such waste products. By realizing that they have discretion and that not all industries are affected equally by environmental regulation, environmental managers can help their companies to achieve a competitive edge by anticipating regulatory pressure and exploring all possibilities for addressing how changing regulations will affect their companies specifically.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that a large plant might have to spend more than a similar but smaller plant on environmental compliance because the larger plant is
A: A. more likely to attract attention from local regulators
B: B. less likely to be exempt from permit and reporting requirements
C: C. less likely to have regulatory costs passed on to it by companies that supply its raw materials
D: D. more likely to employ older production technologies
E: E. more likely to generate wastes that are more environmentally damaging than those generated by smaller plants

### Response:
<think>
Inference This item depends on understanding the implications of the passage’s discussion of differences between large and small plants. It asks what might be true of a larger plant that would compel it to spend more than a smaller plant on environmental compliance. The passage addresses this issue by stating that smaller plants are often not subject to the same permit or reporting requirements that larger plants are.
Explanation A: A. The likelihood of attracting regulatory attention is discussed only in the context of comparing plants that are isolated with small plants that are near large noncompliant ones. The passage does not suggest that size is generally the crucial determining factor in attracting regulatory attention.
Explanation B: B. Correct. According to the passage, certain permit or reporting requirements may not apply to smaller plants; this suggests that larger plants are less likely than smaller plants to be exempt from these requirements, and thus that the larger plants would have to spend more to comply.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not discuss the passing on of regulatory costs from suppliers to plants.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not suggest that larger plants are any more likely than smaller plants to employ older production technologies.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not distinguish between the types of wastes emitted by larger plants and those emitted by smaller plants.

### Question:
According to the passage, which of the following statements about sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs is true?
A: A. Older production technologies cannot be adapted so as to reduce production of these outputs as waste products.
B: B. Under the most recent environmental regulations, industrial plants are no longer permitted to produce these outputs.
C: C. Although these outputs are environmentally hazardous, some plants still generate them as waste products despite the high compliance costs they impose.
D: D. Many older plants have developed innovative technological processes that reduce the amounts of these outputs generated as waste products.
E: E. Since the production processes that generate these outputs are less costly than alternative processes, these less expensive processes are sometimes adopted despite their acknowledged environmental hazards.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This item depends on identifying what the passage states explicitly about outputs of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. The passage says that plants that produce these outputs are those that use older industrial coal-fired burners, and that such plants are subject to extensive compliance costs imposed by new regulations.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not address the question of whether older production technologies might be adapted to reduce outputs of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.
Explanation B: B. The passage states that new regulations have imposed high compliance costs on companies that produce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs, not that these outputs are prohibited.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage states that some companies are still using the older kinds of burners that generate sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs, and that new regulations have imposed high compliance costs on these companies.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not address the question of whether older plants have developed new processes to reduce the amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide they produce.
Explanation E: E. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs, the passage suggests, are produced only by older industrial coal-fired burners; newer facilities (using alternative processes) do not employ this technology, the expense of which is not mentioned in the passage.

Which of the following best describes the relationship of the statement about large plants (lines 12–17) to the passage as a whole?
A: A. It presents a hypothesis that is disproved later in the passage.
B: B. It highlights an opposition between two ideas mentioned in the passage.
C: C. It provides examples to support a claim made earlier in the passage.
D: D. It exemplifies a misconception mentioned earlier in the passage.
E: E. It draws an analogy between two situations described in the passage.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question asks about the role played in the passage by the following statement: Additionally, large plants can spread compliance costs such as waste treatment across a larger revenue base; on the other hand, some smaller plants may not even be subject to certain provisions such as permit or reporting requirements by virtue of their size. This statement describes situations in which compliance costs for plants of different sizes may differ, which serve as evidence in support of the passage’s main claim: that environmental regulations do not affect all competitors in a given industry uniformly.
Explanation A: A. The statement in question is not a hypothesis; rather, it reports factors that are known to affect the varying impact of environmental regulations.
Explanation B: B. This is too vague to be a good description of the kind of relationship the question asks about. The statement in question does present a contrast—it suggests that larger plants’ compliance costs are lower under some circumstances, while smaller plants’ compliance costs are lower under other circumstances. But this purports to state two facts rather than mere ideas; they are contrasting facts but not in any meaningful sense opposed, since they can easily coexist.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The statement provides examples to support the initial claim made in the passage that regulatory costs fall unevenly on competitors in an industry: large plants can spread compliance costs around, and smaller plants may not even have to pay certain costs.
Explanation D: D. This statement helps to dispel, not exemplify, a misconception mentioned earlier in the passage—i.e., the myth that environmental regulations affect all companies in an industry the same way.
Explanation E: E. The statement does not suggest that the situation of larger and smaller plants is similar (or analogous) to any other situation mentioned in the passage.

Explanation A: A. The passage is not about the management of any environmental problem, which would be a problem about how to prevent or undo damage to the environment. The passage primarily aims to dispel a belief that the passage says is widely held by environmental managers.
Explanation B: B. The passage refers to variations in firms’ levels of compliance with environmental regulations, but its primary purpose is not to illustrate those varying levels, nor does it do so.
Explanation C: C. The passage suggests that most environmental managers are mistaken about a key concept; its primary purpose is not to describe traditional methods of environmental management or alternatives to those traditional methods, nor does it do so.
Explanation D: D. The passage takes no position on whether companies should increase their compliance with environmental regulation.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The passage primarily aims to dispel the belief that environmental regulations affect all companies in an industry uniformly.

Focus on understanding the main idea, supporting details, author's purpose, and inferences that can be drawn from the passage. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Findings from several studies on corporate mergers and acquisitions during the 1970s and 1980s raise questions about why firms initiate and consummate such transactions. One study showed, for example, that acquiring firms were on average unable to maintain acquired firms’ pre-merger levels of profitability. A second study concluded that post-acquisition gains to most acquiring firms were not adequate to cover the premiums paid to obtain acquired firms. A third demonstrated that, following the announcement of a prospective merger, the stock of the prospective acquiring firm tends to increase in value much less than does that of the firm for which it bids. Yet mergers and acquisitions remain common, and bidders continue to assert that their objectives are economic ones. Acquisitions may well have the desirable effect of channeling a nation’s resources efficiently from less to more efficient sectors of its economy, but the individual executives arranging these deals must see them as advancing either their own or their companies’ private economic interests. It seems that factors having little to do with corporate economic interests explain acquisitions. These factors may include the incentive compensation of executives, lack of monitoring by boards of directors, and managerial error in estimating the value of firms targeted for acquisition. Alternatively, the acquisition acts of bidders may derive from modeling: a manager does what other managers do.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. review research demonstrating the benefits of corporate mergers and acquisitions and examine some of the drawbacks that acquisition behavior entails
B: B. contrast the effects of corporate mergers and acquisitions on acquiring firms and on firms that are acquired
C: C. report findings that raise questions about a reason for corporate mergers and acquisitions and suggest possible alternative reasons
D: D. explain changes in attitude on the part of acquiring firms toward corporate mergers and acquisitions
E: E. account for a recent decline in the rate of corporate mergers and acquisitions

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question requires understanding what the passage as a whole is trying to do. The passage begins by citing three studies that demonstrate that when firms acquire other firms, there is not necessarily a worthwhile economic gain. The passage then cites economic interests as the reason given by firms when they acquire other firms but calls into question the veracity of this reasoning. The passage then goes on to speculate as to why mergers and acquisitions occur.
Explanation A: A. The research cited in the passage calls into question whether mergers and acquisitions are beneficial to firms.
Explanation B: B. The passage is not concerned with comparing the relative effects of mergers and acquisitions on the acquired and acquiring firms.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage surveys reports that question the reason given by firms when they acquire other firms and suggests other reasons for these acquisitions.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not indicate that there has been a change in the attitude of acquiring firms toward mergers and acquisitions.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not indicate that there has been a decline in the rate of mergers and acquisitions.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements about corporate acquisitions?
A: A. Their known benefits to national economies explain their appeal to individual firms during the 1970s and 1980s.
B: B. Despite their adverse impact on some firms, they are the best way to channel resources from less to more productive sectors of a nation’s economy.
C: C. They are as likely to occur because of poor monitoring by boards of directors as to be caused by incentive compensation for managers.
D: D. They will be less prevalent in the future, since their actual effects will gain wider recognition.
E: E. Factors other than economic benefit to the acquiring firm help to explain the frequency with which they occur.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question requires understanding what view the author has about a particular issue. The three studies cited by the passage all suggest that mergers and acquisitions do not necessarily bring economic benefit to the acquiring firms. The author concludes therefore that factors having little to do with corporate economic interests explain acquisitions and then goes on to speculate as to what the reasons may actually be.
Explanation A: A. The passage indicates that while mergers and acquisitions may benefit the national economy, the appeal of mergers and acquisitions must be tied to companies’ private economic interests.
Explanation B: B. The passage makes no judgment as to the best way for firms to channel resources from less to more efficient economic sectors.
Explanation C: C. The passage makes no comparison between the influence of poor monitoring by boards and that of executive incentives.
Explanation D: D. The passage makes no prediction as to future trends in the market for mergers and acquisitions.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The passage states that factors other than economic interests drive mergers and acquisitions.

### Question:
The author of the passage mentions the effect of acquisitions on national economies most probably in order to
A: A. provide an explanation for the mergers and acquisitions of the 1970s and 1980s overlooked by the findings discussed in the passage

E: E. explain how modeling affected the decisions made by managers involved in mergers and acquisitions during the 1970s and 1980s

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question requires understanding why a piece of information is included in the passage. After the passage cites the results of the three studies on mergers and acquisitions, which call into question the economic benefits of acquisitions, it indicates that firms nonetheless claim that their objectives are economic. The passage then states that while acquisitions may well have a desirable effect on national economies, the results of the studies suggest that factors other than economic interest must drive executives to arrange mergers and acquisitions.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not mention national economies as part of an explanation for the occurrence of mergers and acquisitions.
Explanation B: B. The passage suggests that the effect of acquisitions on national economies is not tied to any explanations for why acquisitions occur.
Explanation C: C. The effect of acquisitions on national economies is not mentioned in the passage as an explanation for why acquisitions occur.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage uses the mention of national economies as part of a larger point questioning the stated motivations behind firms’ efforts to acquire other firms.
Explanation E: E. In the passage, modeling is unrelated to the idea that acquisitions may have a desirable effect on national economies.

### Question:
The author of the passage implies that which of the following is a possible partial explanation for acquisition behavior during the 1970s and 1980s?
A: A. Managers wished to imitate other managers primarily because they saw how financially beneficial other firms’ acquisitions were.
B: B. Managers miscalculated the value of firms that were to be acquired.
C: C. Lack of consensus within boards of directors resulted in their imposing conflicting goals on managers.
D: D. Total compensation packages for managers increased during that period.
E: E. The value of bidding firms’ stock increased significantly when prospective mergers were announced.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question requires recognizing what can be inferred from the information in the passage. After providing the results of the studies of mergers and acquisitions, the author concludes that even though acquiring firms state that their objectives are economic, factors having little to do with corporate economic interests explain acquisitions (lines 10–11). Among alternative explanations, the author points to managerial error in estimating the value of firms targeted for acquisition (lines 12–13) as possibly contributing to acquisition behavior in the 1970s and 1980s.
Explanation A: A. While the passage indicates that managers may have modeled their behavior on other managers, it does not provide a reason for why this would be so.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The author states that one explanation for acquisition behavior may be that managers erred when they estimated the value of firms being acquired.
Explanation C: C. The author discusses a lack of monitoring by boards of directors but makes no mention of consensus within these boards.
Explanation D: D. The author does not discuss compensation packages for managers.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not state how significantly the value of the bidding firm’s stock increased upon announcing a merger but only that it increased less in value than did the stock of the prospective firm being acquired.

### Passage:
Historical documents have revealed that among the Timucua of Florida, a Native American people, the best from the hunt or the harvest was given to families of high social status, even in times of economic stress. Archaeological research suggests a similar relationship between social status and diet in the Dallas communities of eastern Tennessee, prehistoric Native American groups with a social organization and economy similar to that of the Timucua. The first real clue came when archaeologists discovered that skeletons of higher- status individuals tended to be several centimeters taller than those of people of lower status.  In the largest Dallas communities, some individuals were buried in the earthen mounds that served as substructures for buildings important to civic and religious affairs. These burials included quantities of finely crafted items made of nonlocal material, denoting the high political standing of those interred. Burials of lower-status individuals contained primarily utilitarian items such as cooking vessels and chipped stone tools and are located in more remote sections of the settlements. The burials actually formed a pattern, the tallest skeletons being found in the mounds, and the heights declining as burials became more distant from the mounds. While it is possible that taller people were simply more successful in achieving high social standing, it is more likely that a number of stresses, including those resulting from a relatively poor diet, which could affect stature, were common among the lower-status groups.  Excavations indicate that three food categories made up the bulk of the population’s diet: agricultural crops cultivated in the fertile alluvial soils where the communities were located, game, and wild edible plants, primarily nuts. Information about dietary variation among community members is derived by analyzing trace elements in human bone. Higher than normal levels of manganese, strontium, and vanadium probably indicate a less nutritious diet heavily dependent on edible plants. Very low concentrations of vanadium, which is scarce in meats and somewhat lower in nuts than in other plant resources, are good evidence of meat consumption and thus a better balanced diet. As expected, vanadium was found in considerably greater quantities in skeletons in the burials of lower-status groups.

### Question:
According to the passage, which of the following statements regarding earthen mounds in the Dallas communities is accurate?
A: A. They served primarily as burial grounds.
B: B. They were constructed in key locations on the perimeter of the village.
C: C. They were elements in important structures in the community.
D: D. They were used as storehouses for keeping valuable possessions safe.
E: E. They contained utilitarian items made of nonlocal materials.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Ideas This question requires recognizing what claim the passage makes about the earthen mounds in the Dallas communities. The passage states that in the largest Dallas communities, earthen mounds served as substructures for buildings that were important for civic and religious affairs.
Explanation A: A. The passage does indicate that some individuals were buried in the mounds, but the mounds are also described as having served as substructures for buildings important to civic and religious affairs. The passage does not indicate whether either of these purposes was primary.
Explanation B: B. The fact that the mounds served as substructures for important civic and religious buildings does not suggest that they were located on the perimeter of villages.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The mounds are described in the passage as substructures for buildings that were important to civic and religious affairs.
Explanation D: D. Valuable possessions are not described as being stored in the mounds for safekeeping, but rather as being buried there along with the high-status people interred there.
Explanation E: E. The items described as being made of nonlocal materials are not utilitarian objects but rather finely crafted items that denoted the high political status of the people interred in the mounds.

### Question:
In lines 26–28, the author of the passage raises the possibility that taller people achieved greater success most probably in order to
A: A. suggest that two explanations for a phenomenon are equally plausible

C: C. anticipate an objection to an argument
D: D. question the usefulness of relying solely on physical evidence
E: E. point out a weakness in a traditional argument

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question requires recognizing what role the author intends lines 26–28 to play in the context of the passage. The passage points out that the burials of the Dallas communities formed a pattern, with the tallest skeletons being interred in the mounds, and progressively smaller skeletons interred progressively more distant from the mounds. The passage infers from this that the people buried further from the mounds were of lower status, and their lower status—because of a relatively poor diet—led to these people being less tall. Lines 26– 28—stating that it is possible that taller people had greater success in attaining high status—is presented as an alternative possible explanation, thus a potential objection to the implication the author makes.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not suggest that two explanations are equally plausible, and in fact suggests one explanation is superior to the one expressed in lines 26–28.
Explanation B: B. Lines 26–28 does not serve as empirical data supporting a position, but rather as a potential objection to the position the author supports.
Explanation C: C. Correct. In lines 26–28, the author presents an explanation that is an alternative to the one the author proposes, thereby anticipating an objection to the author’s argument.
Explanation D: D. The author throughout the passage argues solely on the basis of physical evidence and does not question the usefulness of such evidence at this or any point.
Explanation E: E. Nowhere is any argument characterized as a traditional argument.

### Question:
The passage suggests that the “relationship” mentioned in line 6 was initially recognized when archaeologists
A: A. attempted to trace the ancestry of the Timucua of Florida
B: B. discovered a height differential among members of subgroups in the Dallas community
C: C. realized that the Dallas communities endured periods of nutritional deprivation
D: D. began to compare the social organization and economies of the Timucua with that of the Dallas communities
E: E. became curious about differences in trace elements found in the bones of Dallas community members

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question requires recognizing what the passage suggests about the relationship mentioned in line 6. The passage begins with a brief mention of the Timucua of Florida, among whom the best food derived from harvesting and hunting went to families of high social status. The passage then shifts to its main focus, a similar relationship between diet and social status among the Dallas communities. Evidence for this relationship first came when archaeologists discovered that higher-status individuals in the Dallas community tended to be significantly taller than lower-status individuals.
Explanation A: A. The passage makes no mention of attempts to trace the ancestry of the Timucua of Florida.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage asserts that the first clue regarding the relationship between diet and social status in Dallas communities came when archaeologists noted the height differences between members of different socioeconomic subgroups.
Explanation C: C. The passage makes no mention of periods of nutritional deprivation in the Dallas communities. It does mention times of economic stress among the Timucua, but this is not related to the recognition of the relationship between social status and diet in Dallas communities.
Explanation D: D. The passage does mention similarities between the social organization and economies of the Timucua and those of the Dallas communities, but there is no indication in the passage of whether these comparisons were first made before or after the discovery of the relationship between status and diet among the Dallas communities.
Explanation E: E. The fact that there are differences in trace elements found in Dallas community members is mentioned in the passage, and it is used as evidence for the existence of the relationship between social status and diet. Curiosity about these differences in trace elements, however, is not what the passage identifies as the first real clue about the existence of this relationship.

### Passage:
Historical documents have revealed that among the Timucua of Florida, a Native American people, the best from the hunt or the harvest was given to families of high social status, even in times of economic stress. Archaeological research suggests a similar relationship between social status and diet in the Dallas communities of eastern Tennessee, prehistoric Native American groups with a social organization and economy similar to that of the Timucua.

While it is possible that taller people were simply more successful in achieving high social standing, it is more likely that a number of stresses, including those resulting from a relatively poor diet, which could affect stature, were common among the lower-status groups.  Excavations indicate that three food categories made up the bulk of the population’s diet: agricultural crops cultivated in the fertile alluvial soils where the communities were located, game, and wild edible plants, primarily nuts. Information about dietary variation among community members is derived by analyzing trace elements in human bone. Higher than normal levels of manganese, strontium, and vanadium probably indicate a less nutritious diet heavily dependent on edible plants. Very low concentrations of vanadium, which is scarce in meats and somewhat lower in nuts than in other plant resources, are good evidence of meat consumption and thus a better balanced diet. As expected, vanadium was found in considerably greater quantities in skeletons in the burials of lower-status groups.

### Question:
The passage suggests which of the following about the diet of the Dallas communities?
A: A. Wild edible plants were a relatively minor element in the diet.
B: B. Game was less likely to be available to lower-status individuals than were edible plants.
C: C. The diet was composed primarily of agricultural crops when game was scarce.
D: D. The diet was obtained entirely from local food sources.
E: E. The diet was well balanced, especially at harvest-time.

### Response:
<think>
Inference Answering this question requires recognizing something that is suggested by the passage. The passage indicates that high levels of vanadium in human bone indicate a less nutritious diet that is heavily dependent on edible plants. A low level of vanadium, which is scarce in meat, would serve as evidence for a higher proportion of meat in an individual’s diet. The passage also indicates that among the Dallas communities, game, rather than domestic animals, served as the source of meat. The other primary food sources were agricultural crops and wild edible plants, primarily nuts. Finally, the passage indicates high levels of vanadium in the skeletons of lower-status individuals of the Dallas communities. All this information taken together suggests that game was less likely to be available to such lower-status individuals than were edible plants.
Explanation A: A. The passage indicates that wild edible plants were one of the three primary elements in the diet of the Dallas communities.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage suggests that game was less available to lower-status individuals, and implies this from the fact that bones found in the burials of lower-status individuals contained greater quantities of vanadium.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate whether, when game was scarce, the diet of the Dallas communities relied on agricultural crops more than on wild edible plants.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not indicate whether all of the Dallas communities’ food was locally sourced, which leaves open the possibility that some of their food came from elsewhere.
Explanation E: E. The passage provides support for the claim that, among the lower-status individuals in the Dallas communities, the diet was not well balanced; furthermore, the passage provides no evidence as to whether the diet of these communities became any more or less balanced at harvest-time.

### Passage:
Historically, relations between workers and employers in the United States have often been characterized by the employment-at-will doctrine, according to which the duration of employment is determined by the employer and the grounds for termination are limited only by the provisions of contracts and specific statutes. Many state courts and legislatures have reevaluated this doctrine and have modified it by expanding the concept of wrongful termination, thereby increasing employer liability. Some economic theorists suggest that such changes tend to reduce employment in states that enact them, because protecting workers against wrongful termination raises the cost of labor to employers: firms will tend to spend more time and money screening potential employees, be reluctant to terminate less-productive workers, and incur greater legal expenses. In a study that took into account differences among states, researchers Dertouzos and Karoly concluded that states with wrongful-termination laws experienced a 2 percent to 5 percent drop in their employment rate as a result of adopting these laws. They also found that the impact on employment appears to be smallest in manufacturing, where unions have already institutionalized similar protection, and in small firms, perhaps because those firms’ lesser ability to pay damages makes it less profitable for employees to file wrongful-termination lawsuits against them.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. explore the legal consequences of terminating a worker’s employment
B: B. define the employment-at-will doctrine and chronicle its historical evolution
C: C. examine reasons underlying a trend away from the employment-at-will doctrine
D: D. advocate increased protection for workers against wrongful termination by employers
E: E. discuss a possible drawback of state laws intended to protect workers against wrongful termination

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question requires understanding the passage as a whole. The passage discusses the consequences that result from the enactment by state legislatures of laws that expand the concept of wrongful termination. It considers whether protecting workers against wrongful termination raises employers’ labor costs, resulting in a reduction in employment in those states. A study by Dertouzos and Karoly confirmed that these laws do have such an effect.
Explanation A: A. The passage considers the effect on employment rates of expanding the concept of wrongful termination, not the legal consequences of terminating a worker’s employment.
Explanation B: B. The passage does define the employment-at-will doctrine and discusses one change made to that doctrine by certain states, but it does not recount a series of specific changes that would constitute an account of its historical evolution.
Explanation C: C. The passage simply asserts that some states have made a specific type of change to the employment-at-will doctrine; it does not examine reasons why the change has been made.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not advocate increased protection for workers against wrongful termination by employers, but rather indicates that one study has found that certain negative consequences arise from such increased protection.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The passage describes the findings of a study showing that state laws intended to protect workers against wrongful termination led to modest declines in employment in that state, indicating a possible drawback to such state laws.

Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Historically, relations between workers and employers in the United States have often been characterized by the employment-at-will doctrine, according to which the duration of employment is determined by the employer and the grounds for termination are limited only by the provisions of contracts and specific statutes. Many state courts and legislatures have reevaluated this doctrine and have modified it by expanding the concept of wrongful termination, thereby increasing employer liability. Some economic theorists suggest that such changes tend to reduce employment in states that enact them, because protecting workers against wrongful termination raises the cost of labor to employers: firms will tend to spend more time and money screening potential employees, be reluctant to terminate less-productive workers, and incur greater legal expenses. In a study that took into account differences among states, researchers Dertouzos and Karoly concluded that states with wrongful-termination laws experienced a 2 percent to 5 percent drop in their employment rate as a result of adopting these laws. They also found that the impact on employment appears to be smallest in manufacturing, where unions have already institutionalized similar protection, and in small firms, perhaps because those firms’ lesser ability to pay damages makes it less profitable for employees to file wrongful-termination lawsuits against them.

### Question:
Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?
A: A. An idea is proposed and arguments against it are examined and then refuted.
B: B. A doctrine is defined and reasons for favoring its adoption are listed.
C: C. A doctrine is criticized, several possible alternatives are outlined, and one is endorsed.
D: D. An idea is described, its antithesis is presented, and a synthesis of the two is proposed.
E: E. A doctrine is defined, a revision to it is described, and the implications of that revision are discussed.

### Response:
<think>
Logical Structure The passage begins by introducing and defining a doctrine that has historically prevailed in the United States, the doctrine of employment-at-will. The passage then goes on to consider a modification of the doctrine that has been implemented, namely, an expansion of the concept of wrongful termination. Finally, the passage presents the results of a study showing some negative implications of this modification of the doctrine.
Explanation A: A. Though the passage does provide some negative effects of the expansion of wrongful termination that could be used in an argument against that expansion, the passage does not refute such an argument.
Explanation B: B. The passage does define a doctrine, but the doctrine is already widely implemented, and the passage does not list reasons favoring its adoption.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not criticize the doctrine of employment-at-will, though it does present some negative information about a modification of it—the expansion of the concept of wrongful termination. But the passage does not list several alternatives either to the doctrine or to its modification.
Explanation D: D. Even if one could describe the discussion of the expansion of wrongful termination as the “antithesis” of the doctrine of employment-at-will—a description that is not well supported—the passage does not propose any synthesis of the two.
Explanation E: E. Correct. A doctrine (employment-at-will) is defined, a revision—the expansion of the concept of wrongful termination—is discussed, and evidence of negative effects of the revision is discussed.

### Passage:
Historically, relations between workers and employers in the United States have often been characterized by the employment-at-will doctrine, according to which the duration of employment is determined by the employer and the grounds for termination are limited only by the provisions of contracts and specific statutes. Many state courts and legislatures have reevaluated this doctrine and have modified it by expanding the concept of wrongful termination, thereby increasing employer liability.

### Question:
The passage suggests which of the following regarding wrongful-termination lawsuits?
A: A. States that do not implement wrongful-termination laws will probably see an increase in wrongful-termination lawsuits.
B: B. It is less profitable to file wrongful-termination lawsuits against unionized companies than against companies without unions.
C: C. A wrongful-termination lawsuit is less costly to a company than continuing the employment of an unproductive worker.
D: D. Obtaining financial compensation is an important motivation for filing wrongful- termination lawsuits.
E: E. Those who file wrongful-termination lawsuits are likely to be awarded larger settlements under the employment-at-will doctrine than under wrongful-termination laws.

### Response:
<think>
Inference Answering this question requires recognizing what the passage suggests regarding wrongful- termination lawsuits. The passage does not directly state that one of the motivations for filing wrongful-termination lawsuits is obtaining financial compensation, but there are suggestions that this is the case. For instance, the passage discusses the increased cost of labor to employers due to the expansion of the concept of wrongful termination. The threat of wrongful-termination lawsuits leads employers to spend more time and money screening potential employees, suggesting that the cost to employers of successfully being sued for wrongful termination would likely involve some financial payout—or compensation—to the former employees who sue them. Additionally, the passage mentions the various degrees of profitability for employees who file wrongful-termination lawsuits, which results in various degrees of motivation to file such suits, suggesting that financial compensation is a crucial motivation for filing these suits.
Explanation A: A. The passage gives no indication that states that do not implement such laws would likely see an increase in wrongful-termination lawsuits.
Explanation B: B. The passage does indicate that the reduction in employment due to a state’s expansion of the concept of wrongful termination would be smaller for unionized companies than for nonunionized companies. However, the passage suggests that this is because unions have already implemented protection from wrongful termination—and so there would not be much of a change from current practice—and not because the lawsuits would be less profitable.
Explanation C: C. The passage states that economic theorists suggest that expanding the concept of wrongful termination will lead firms to be reluctant to terminate less-productive workers, which would not be the case if such lawsuits were less costly than retaining such workers.
Explanation D: D. Correct. As discussed above, the passage strongly implies that financial compensation is a significant motivation for such lawsuits.
Explanation E: E. If this were the case, the expansion of the concept of wrongful termination would not lead to increased employment costs and a reduction in employment.

### Passage:
Two works published in 1984 demonstrate contrasting approaches to writing the history of United States women. Buel and Buel’s biography of Mary Fish (1736–1818) makes little effort to place her story in the context of recent historiography on women. Lebsock, meanwhile, attempts not only to write the history of women in one southern community, but also to redirect two decades of historiographical debate as to whether women gained or lost status in the nineteenth century as compared with the eighteenth century. Although both books offer the reader the opportunity to assess this controversy regarding women’s status, only Lebsock’s deals with it directly. She examines several different aspects of women’s status, helping to refine and resolve the issues. She concludes that while women gained autonomy in some areas, especially in the private sphere, they lost it in many aspects of the economic sphere. More importantly, she shows that the debate itself depends on frame of reference: in many respects, women lost power in relation to men, for example, as certain jobs (delivering babies, supervising schools) were taken over by men. Yet women also gained power in comparison with their previous status, owning a higher proportion of real estate, for example. In contrast, Buel and Buel’s biography provides ample raw material for questioning the myth, fostered by some historians, of a colonial golden age in the eighteenth century but does not give the reader much guidance in analyzing the controversy over women’s status.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. examine two sides of a historiographical debate
B: B. call into question an author’s approach to a historiographical debate
C: C. examine one author’s approach to a historiographical debate
D: D. discuss two authors’ works in relationship to a historiographical debate
E: E. explain the prevalent perspective on a historiographical debate

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question requires understanding what the passage as a whole is attempting to do. The passage opens by introducing two books published in 1984 that both concern the history of women in the United States. The passage then makes it clear that one book deals directly (line 15) with the issue of women’s status, while the other does not. The passage then goes on to discuss the perspective that each book takes and what each book has to offer for an assessment of women’s status in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Explanation A: A. The two books discussed in the passage do not take different sides on a particular debate but rather are described as being more or less useful to the debate itself.
Explanation B: B. The passage focuses on how two different books contain information useful to a particular historiographical debate but does not call into question the approach of either book.
Explanation C: C. The passage focuses on two authors’ works, not one.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage discusses what two different books have to offer in relation to a particular historiographical debate.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not describe any perspective on a particular historiographical debate as being more prevalent than any other.

### Question:
The author of the passage mentions the supervision of schools primarily in order to
A: A. remind readers of the role education played in the cultural changes of the nineteenth century in the United States
B: B. suggest an area in which nineteenth-century American women were relatively free to exercise power
C: C. provide an example of an occupation for which accurate data about women’s participation are difficult to obtain
D: D. speculate about which occupations were considered suitable for United States women of the nineteenth century
E: E. illustrate how the answers to questions about women’s status depend on particular contexts

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation Answering this question depends on understanding what role a particular piece of information plays in the passage as a whole. The author implicitly supports Lebsock’s contention (beginning at line 20) that different frames of reference can produce different perspectives on the debate about women’s status in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The author then summarizes different contexts cited by Lebsock to support the contention about frames of reference. As part of this summary, the author refers to supervising schools (lines 24–25) as an example of a job that apparently showed women losing power.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not discuss the role of education in the nineteenth century.
Explanation B: B. The passage does mention some ways in which, according to Lebsock, women . . . gained power (lines 25–26) in the nineteenth century, but supervising schools is not among them.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not discuss the difficulty of obtaining data about particular occupations.
Explanation D: D. The passage makes no judgments about the suitability for women of any jobs in the nineteenth century.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The passage mentions supervising schools as part of an illustration of Lebsock’s claim that the debate about women’s status depends on the context being examined.

A: A. Lebsock has studied women from a formerly neglected region and time period.
B: B. Lebsock has demonstrated the importance of frame of reference in answering questions about women’s status.
C: C. Lebsock has addressed the controversy by using women’s current status as a frame of reference.
D: D. Lebsock has analyzed statistics about occupations and property that were previously ignored.
E: E. Lebsock has applied recent historiographical methods to the biography of a nineteenth- century woman.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea Answering this question requires recognizing information explicitly given in the passage. The passage introduces the work of Lebsock in line 6 and then goes on to describe several characteristics of Lebsock’s book. In lines 20–22, the author introduces Lebsock’s claim that the historiographical debate about women’s status is dependent on frame of reference and calls that claim important; the passage then gives an example showing how frame of reference affects views of women’s status. In so doing, the author displays an implicit agreement with Lebsock’s discussion on this point.
Explanation A: A. The author of the passage portrays neither the place nor time period that Lebsock focuses on as having been neglected by historians.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The author describes as important Lebsock’s idea that frame of reference informs the debate about women’s status.
Explanation C: C. According to the passage, Lebsock’s book deals with women’s status in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, not the present status of women.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not mention or imply that Lebsock analyzed statistics in writing her book.
Explanation E: E. Although the passage does describe Lebsock’s book as pertaining to an ongoing historiographical debate, it identifies the book’s topic as women in one southern community (lines 7–8), not the life of a single woman.

Inference This question requires making an inference based on information given in the passage. As part of the passage’s description of Lebsock’s contribution to the historiographical debate about women’s status in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Lebsock’s conclusions about women’s autonomy are described. As part of this description, the passage cites Lebsock’s conclusion that nineteenth-century women lost economic autonomy when compared to eighteenth-century women (lines 17–20).
Explanation A: A. The passage states that in many ways women in the nineteenth century lost power in relation to men (line 23), which would imply that in those respects eighteenth-century women had more power in relation to men, not less. The only increase mentioned in nineteenth-century women’s power is associated with owning more real estate.
Explanation B: B. The passage states that more nineteenth-century women owned real estate.
Explanation C: C. Correct. As the passage states, Lebsock concluded that nineteenth-century women lost economic autonomy compared to eighteenth-century women.
Explanation D: D. The passage states that nineteenth-century women gained more independence in their private lives.

### Question:
The passage suggests that Buel and Buel’s biography of Mary Fish provides evidence for which of the following views of women’s history?
A: A. Women have lost power in relation to men since the colonial era.
B: B. Women of the colonial era were not as likely to be concerned with their status as were women in the nineteenth century.
C: C. The colonial era was not as favorable for women as some historians have believed.
D: D. Women had more economic autonomy in the colonial era than in the nineteenth century.
E: E. Women’s occupations were generally more respected in the colonial era than in the nineteenth century.

### Response:

Inference This question requires understanding what the passage implies. The approach that Buel and Buel’s work takes is specifically described in lines 3–6 and again in lines 28–34. In lines 29–32, the passage states that Buel and Buel’s work provides ample raw material for questioning the myth . . . of a colonial golden age in the eighteenth century, referring to a myth about women’s status. In describing this golden age as a myth fostered by some historians, the passage suggests that this era was not as favorable to women as these historians suggest.
Explanation A: A. The passage describes Lebsock’s work as providing such evidence, not Buel and Buel’s work.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not pertain to the level of concern women had for their status.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The final paragraph of the passage describes Buel and Buel’s work as providing material that calls into question claims that the eighteenth century was especially favorable to women.
Explanation D: D. The passage refers to the economic autonomy of women in relation to Lebsock’s work, not Buel and Buel’s work.

### Passage:
Acting on the recommendation of a British government committee investigating the high incidence in white lead factories of illness among employees, most of whom were women, the Home Secretary proposed in 1895 that Parliament enact legislation that would prohibit women from holding most jobs in white lead factories. Although the Women’s Industrial Defence Committee (WIDC), formed in 1892 in response to earlier legislative attempts to restrict women’s labor, did not discount the white lead trade’s potential health dangers, it opposed the proposal, viewing it as yet another instance of limiting women’s work opportunities.  Also opposing the proposal was the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women (SPEW), which attempted to challenge it by investigating the causes of illness in white lead factories. SPEW contended, and WIDC concurred, that controllable conditions in such factories were responsible for the development of lead poisoning. SPEW provided convincing evidence that lead poisoning could be avoided if workers were careful and clean and if already extant workplace safety regulations were stringently enforced. However, the Women’s Trade Union League (WTUL), which had ceased in the late 1880s to oppose restrictions on women’s labor, supported the eventually enacted proposal, in part because safety regulations were generally not being enforced in white lead factories, where there were no unions (and little prospect of any) to pressure employers to comply with safety regulations.

### Question:
The passage suggests that WIDC differed from WTUL in which of the following ways?
A: A. WIDC believed that the existing safety regulations were adequate to protect women’s health, whereas WTUL believed that such regulations needed to be strengthened.
B: B. WIDC believed that unions could not succeed in pressuring employers to comply with such regulations, whereas WTUL believed that unions could succeed in doing so.
C: C. WIDC believed that lead poisoning in white lead factories could be avoided by controlling conditions there, whereas WTUL believed that lead poisoning in such factories could not be avoided no matter how stringently safety regulations were enforced.
D: D. At the time that the legislation concerning white lead factories was proposed, WIDC was primarily concerned with addressing health conditions in white lead factories, whereas WTUL was concerned with improving working conditions in all types of factories.
E: E. At the time that WIDC was opposing legislative attempts to restrict women’s labor, WTUL had already ceased to do so.

### Response:
<think>
Inference To answer this question, you need to understand the differences between WIDC and WTUL as they are described in the passage. The only information about WTUL in the passage is that it had stopped opposing restrictions on women’s labor in the late 1880s, and that, because existing safety regulations were not being enforced, it supported the proposal to prohibit women from working in white lead factories. WIDC, on the other hand, was formed in 1892 specifically to oppose restrictions on women’s labor, and it opposed the proposal.
Explanation A: A. According to the passage, WIDC did believe that existing safety regulations, if enforced, could prevent lead poisoning. WTUL may or may not have believed that the safety regulations needed to be strengthened; all the passage states is that WTUL did not believe that the safety regulations were likely to be enforced.
Explanation B: B. The passage states that WTUL believed that because there were no unions to pressure employers, the employers would not comply with safety regulations. The passage does not present any information on which to base a conclusion about WIDC’s beliefs regarding union pressure on employers.
Explanation C: C. Based on information in the passage, both WIDC and SPEW believed that enforcing safety regulations could protect women against lead poisoning. WIDC supported SPEW’s position on the matter. WTUL believed that safety regulations were unlikely to be enforced because of the lack of unions.
Explanation D: D. The passage states that WIDC viewed the proposal to restrict women’s employment in white lead factories as an instance of legislation designed to limit women’s work opportunities—precisely the legislation that WIDC was formed to oppose. Thus, WIDC was not primarily concerned with the factories’ health conditions.
Explanation E: E. Correct. WIDC began opposing legislative attempts to restrict women’s labor in 1892 and continued to do so through at least 1895, when the Home Secretary proposed prohibiting women from working in white lead factories. WTUL stopped opposing restrictions on women’s labor in the late 1880s, before WIDC was even founded. Thus, the passage suggests that WTUL had stopped opposing restrictions on women’s labor well before WIDC worked to oppose such legislation.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, would most clearly support the contention attributed to SPEW in lines 17–20?
A: A. Those white lead factories that most strongly enforced regulations concerning worker safety and hygiene had the lowest incidences of lead poisoning among employees.
B: B. The incidence of lead poisoning was much higher among women who worked in white lead factories than among women who worked in other types of factories.
C: C. There were many household sources of lead that could have contributed to the incidence of lead poisoning among women who also worked outside the home in the late nineteenth century.
D: D. White lead factories were more stringent than were certain other types of factories in their enforcement of workplace safety regulations.
E: E. Even brief exposure to the conditions typically found in white lead factories could cause lead poisoning among factory workers.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question requires the reader to find a statement that would provide additional support for the contention made in the following statement: SPEW contended, and WIDC concurred, that controllable conditions in such factories were responsible for the development of lead poisoning. Information suggesting that when conditions were controlled, lead poisoning was less likely to develop would provide support for SPEW’s contention.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If incidences of lead poisoning were low in those factories that enforced hygiene and safety regulations, that would suggest that lead poisoning was not an inevitable result of working in a white lead factory—but rather that lead poisoning was the result of poor hygiene and safety practices.
Explanation B: B. It would not be particularly surprising for the incidence of lead poisoning to be higher among women working in white lead factories than among women working in other kinds of factories—but such a finding would say nothing about whether controllable conditions had any effect on the development of lead poisoning.
Explanation C: C. The existence of household sources of lead that might contribute to lead poisoning would weaken, not support, SPEW’s contention that controllable factory conditions were responsible for the development of lead poisoning.
Explanation D: D. If white lead factories enforced workplace safety regulations more stringently than did some other types of factories, it might be the case that SPEW’s contention was incorrect: that even controlled conditions could not prevent a high incidence of lead poisoning.
Explanation E: E. If the conditions typically found in white lead factories were particularly bad with regard to safety and hygiene, it could conceivably be the case that SPEW’s contention was true— that is, that the conditions that caused lead poisoning were controllable. But it might also be the case that an uncontrollable aspect of those conditions caused lead poisoning. Thus, this neither supports nor undermines SPEW’s contention clearly.

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea Answering this question depends on identifying the overall point of the passage. The passage is mainly concerned with explaining the reasons behind the positions taken by WIDC and SPEW, which opposed the proposal to enact legislation prohibiting women from holding most white lead factory jobs, and the reasoning of WTUL, which supported the proposal.
Explanation A: A. The passage explains how WIDC viewed the proposal, but it does not indicate what any of the groups believed about the motivations of the Home Secretary, who made the proposal.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage contrasts the reasoning of the WIDC and SPEW, both of which believed that enforcing safety regulations would make the proposed legislation unnecessary, with the reasoning of WTUL, which thought that safety regulations were unlikely to be enforced and thus supported the proposal.
Explanation C: C. The passage simply states that the proposal was eventually enacted; it does not trace the process by which this occurred.
Explanation D: D. The passage implies that WIDC and SPEW were unsuccessful in their opposition to the proposed legislation, but it identifies only one tactic used in opposition to it: SPEW’s attempt to challenge it by investigating the causes of lead poisoning.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not evaluate the groups’ arguments concerning the proposed legislation; rather, it presents those arguments without comment on their quality or value.

### Passage:
It is an odd but indisputable fact that the seventeenth-century English women who are generally regarded as among the forerunners of modern feminism are almost all identified with the Royalist side in the conflict between Royalists and Parliamentarians known as the English Civil Wars. Since Royalist ideology is often associated with the radical patriarchalism of seventeenth-century political theorist Robert Filmer—a patriarchalism that equates family and kingdom and asserts the divinely ordained absolute power of the king and, by analogy, of the male head of the household— historians have been understandably puzzled by the fact that Royalist women wrote the earliest extended criticisms of the absolute subordination of women in marriage and the earliest systematic assertions of women’s rational and moral equality with men. Some historians have questioned the facile equation of Royalist ideology with Filmerian patriarchalism; and indeed, there may have been no consistent differences between Royalists and Parliamentarians on issues of family organization and women’s political rights, but in that case one would expect early feminists to be equally divided between the two sides.  Catherine Gallagher argues that Royalism engendered feminism because the ideology of absolute monarchy provided a transition to an ideology of the absolute self. She cites the example of the notoriously eccentric author Margaret Cavendish (1626–1673), duchess of Newcastle. Cavendish claimed to be as ambitious as any woman could be, but knowing that as a woman she was excluded from the pursuit of power in the real world, she resolved to be mistress of her own world, the “immaterial world” that any person can create within her own mind—and, as a writer, on paper. In proclaiming what she called her “singularity,” Cavendish insisted that she was a self-sufficient being within her mental empire, the center of her own subjective universe rather than a satellite orbiting a dominant male planet. In justifying this absolute singularity, Cavendish repeatedly invoked the model of the absolute monarch, a figure that became a metaphor for the self-enclosed, autonomous nature of the individual person. Cavendish’s successors among early feminists retained her notion of woman’s sovereign self, but they also sought to break free from the complete political and social isolation that her absolute singularity entailed.

### Question:
The author of the passage refers to Robert Filmer (see line 9) primarily in order to
A: A. show that Royalist ideology was somewhat more radical than most historians appear to realize
B: B. qualify the claim that patriarchalism formed the basis of Royalist ideology
C: C. question the view that most early feminists were associated with the Royalist faction
D: D. highlight an apparent tension between Royalist ideology and the ideas of early feminists
E: E. argue that Royalists held conflicting opinions on issues of family organization and women’s political rights

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question asks about the role of Filmer in the passage. The author states that Filmer’s radical patriarchalism is associated with Royalist ideology and then goes on to define radical patriarchalism as an ideology that asserts the power of the king and the male head of the household. Early feminists, however, questioned the subordination of women in marriage. Thus, there seems to be a conflict between these two sets of ideas.
Explanation A: A. Although the passage refers to Filmer’s view as radical patriarchalism, it provides no evidence regarding any differences in the degrees to which historians consider that view, or Royalism in general, to be radical.
Explanation B: B. Filmer’s work supports the claim that patriarchalism was the basis of Royalist ideology; it does not qualify such a claim.
Explanation C: C. That Filmer’s approach was one of radical patriarchalism makes it surprising that early feminists were associated with the Royalist faction, but it does not provide any grounds for questioning whether they were so associated.
Explanation D: D. Correct. There is apparent tension between Filmer’s radical patriarchalism, if that is indeed essential to Royalist ideology, and the ideas of early feminists, who questioned such patriarchalism.
Explanation E: E. The author refers to Filmer in order to suggest, initially, a uniformity among Royalists regarding family and women; it is only later in the passage that this view becomes more complicated.

### Question:
The passage suggests which of the following about the seventeenth-century English women mentioned in line 2?
A: A. Their status as forerunners of modern feminism is not entirely justified.
B: B. They did not openly challenge the radical patriarchalism of Royalist Filmerian ideology.
C: C. Cavendish was the first among these women to criticize women’s subordination in marriage and assert women’s equality with men.
D: D. Their views on family organization and women’s political rights were diametrically opposed to those of both Royalist and Parliamentarian ideology.
E: E. Historians would be less puzzled if more of them were identified with the Parliamentarian side in the English Civil Wars.

### Response:
<think>
Inference The first sentence of the passage refers to women who are both regarded as forerunners of modern feminism and identified as Royalists. The passage goes on to suggest that, given Royalist ideology’s association with Filmer’s radical patriarchalism (equating absolute power of the king with absolute power of the male head of household), it is surprising that feminism would find any footing within such an ideology.
Explanation A: A. Nothing in the passage disputes the idea that the seventeenth-century English women in question should be considered the forerunners of modern feminism.
Explanation B: B. Gallagher provides the example of Margaret Cavendish as a writer who did openly challenge radical patriarchalism—albeit only in her writings.
Explanation C: C. The passage states that Cavendish had successors among early feminists, but it does not indicate whether she herself was the first seventeenth-century English woman to assert women’s equality.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not indicate what the Parliamentarian view of family organization and women’s political rights was, so there is no way to determine whether the Royalist forerunners of modern feminism were opposed to that view.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The basic puzzle the passage sets out to solve is why the forerunners of modern feminism would have been associated with the Royalist side, which seems to have been based on radical patriarchalism. Historians would most likely have been less surprised if these women had been identified with the Parliamentarian side, which presumably did not embrace radical patriarchalism.

### Question:
The passage suggests that Margaret Cavendish’s decision to become an author was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to
A: A. justify her support for the Royalist cause
B: B. encourage her readers to work toward eradicating Filmerian patriarchalism
C: C. persuade other women to break free from their political and social isolation
D: D. analyze the causes for women’s exclusion from the pursuit of power
E: E. create a world over which she could exercise total control

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question asks about Margaret Cavendish’s reasons for becoming an author. The second paragraph describes her as someone who insisted that she was a self-sufficient being; she understood that, given the real-world strictures in place, she could achieve this self-sufficiency in her own mind and on paper as a writer. So her decision to become a writer can be inferred to be motivated by her desire to exercise power and control.
Explanation A: A. The passage states that Cavendish justified her being the center of her own universe by invoking the Royalist figure of the absolute monarch; there is no suggestion in the passage that Cavendish felt the need to justify any support for the actual Royalist cause.
Explanation B: B. The passage gives no direct indication that Cavendish was even aware of Filmerian patriarchalism.
Explanation C: C. The second paragraph states that Cavendish’s idea of absolute singularity carried with it the idea of social and political isolation; Cavendish was most likely not motivated by a desire to persuade other women to break free from such isolation.
Explanation D: D. Cavendish took the exclusion of women from the pursuit of power for granted; the passage does not suggest that she was concerned with its causes.
Explanation E: E. Correct. According to the passage, Cavendish considered herself a self-sufficient being who was at the center of her own universe; in her writing, she wanted to create a world in which this was also true.

### Question:
The phrase “a satellite orbiting a dominant male planet” (lines 41–42) refers most directly to
A: A. Cavendish’s concept that each woman is a sovereign self
B: B. the complete political and social isolation of absolute singularity
C: C. the immaterial world that a writer can create on paper
D: D. the absolute subordination of women in a patriarchal society
E: E. the metaphorical figure of the absolute monarch

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation The phrase in question is a satellite orbiting a dominant male planet. The passage states that this was the idea that Cavendish was reacting against; she preferred instead the idea that she was the center of her own universe, her own sovereign, subject to no one.
Explanation A: A. The idea of a satellite orbiting a dominant male planet refers not to Cavendish’s idea that each woman is a sovereign self, but rather to the idea directly opposed to that: each woman must submit to a dominant male.
Explanation B: B. A satellite orbiting a dominant male planet is by definition not isolated, nor is it singular.
Explanation C: C. According to the passage, Cavendish wished to create her own world as a writer so that she did not have to be a satellite.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The phrase refers to the idea that in a patriarchal society, women are as satellites to men, who are the dominant planets.
Explanation E: E. While radical patriarchy does equate the monarch with the male head of the household, the phrase in question is most directly about the relationship, under patriarchy, between women and men.

E: E. call attention to some points of agreement between opposing sides in an ideological debate

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question asks about the passage as a whole. The passage is mainly concerned with outlining Catherine Gallagher’s attempt to explain why, given Royalist ideology’s apparent association with radical patriarchalism, Royalist women offered feminist critiques of women’s subordination in marriage and asserted their equality with men.
Explanation A: A. The passage makes no connection between early feminism and its modern form.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage presents a puzzling historical phenomenon, that Royalist women critiqued patriarchalism, in the first paragraph, and then presents Catherine Gallagher’s explanation for that phenomenon in the second paragraph.
Explanation C: C. While the passage discusses the political conflict between the Royalists and Parliamentarians in the English Civil Wars in the first paragraph, neither this conflict, nor its ideological origins are the focus of the passage. Furthermore, the passage does not offer any interpretations of the origins of the conflict.
Explanation D: D. The passage attempts to unlink the ideology of political theorist Robert Filmer and the eccentric author Margaret Cavendish by suggesting that Filmer’s radical patriarchalism was not the only way of understanding Royalist ideology. Cavendish provided a different understanding entirely.
Explanation E: E. While both sides of the ideological debate did agree on the absolute monarchy, the passage as a whole does not focus on this agreement, but rather on the disagreement about where, theoretically, the idea of absolute monarchy leads.

### Passage:
It is an odd but indisputable fact that the seventeenth-century English women who are generally regarded as among the forerunners of modern feminism are almost all identified with the Royalist side in the conflict between Royalists and Parliamentarians known as the English Civil Wars. Since Royalist ideology is often associated with the radical patriarchalism of seventeenth-century political theorist Robert Filmer—a patriarchalism that equates family and kingdom and asserts the divinely ordained absolute power of the king and, by analogy, of the male head of the household— historians have been understandably puzzled by the fact that Royalist women wrote the earliest extended criticisms of the absolute subordination of women in marriage and the earliest systematic assertions of women’s rational and moral equality with men. Some historians have questioned the facile equation of Royalist ideology with Filmerian patriarchalism; and indeed, there may have been no consistent differences between Royalists and Parliamentarians on issues of family organization and women’s political rights, but in that case one would expect early feminists to be equally divided between the two sides.  Catherine Gallagher argues that Royalism engendered feminism because the ideology of absolute monarchy provided a transition to an ideology of the absolute self. She cites the example of the notoriously eccentric author Margaret Cavendish (1626–1673), duchess of Newcastle. Cavendish claimed to be as ambitious as any woman could be, but knowing that as a woman she was excluded from the pursuit of power in the real world, she resolved to be mistress of her own world, the “immaterial world” that any person can create within her own mind—and, as a writer, on paper. In proclaiming what she called her “singularity,” Cavendish insisted that she was a self-sufficient being within her mental empire, the center of her own subjective universe rather than a satellite orbiting a dominant male planet. In justifying this absolute singularity, Cavendish repeatedly invoked the model of the absolute monarch, a figure that became a metaphor for the self-enclosed, autonomous nature of the individual person. Cavendish’s successors among early feminists retained her notion of woman’s sovereign self, but they also sought to break free from the complete political and social isolation that her absolute singularity entailed.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, would most clearly undermine Gallagher’s explanation of the link between Royalism and feminism?
A: A. Because of their privileged backgrounds, Royalist women were generally better educated than were their Parliamentarian counterparts.
B: B. Filmer himself had read some of Cavendish’s early writings and was highly critical of her ideas.
C: C. Cavendish’s views were highly individual and were not shared by the other Royalist women who wrote early feminist works.
D: D. The Royalist and Parliamentarian ideologies were largely in agreement on issues of family organization and women’s political rights.
E: E. The Royalist side included a sizable minority faction that was opposed to the more radical tendencies of Filmerian patriarchalism.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question asks about how to undermine the way in which Gallagher connects Royalism and feminism. According to Gallagher, Cavendish’s work exemplifies the connection between these ideas, because Cavendish took the idea of absolute monarchy and extended that to the idea of absolute self, an idea that should, Cavendish believed, apply to women as well as men.
Explanation A: A. Gallagher’s explanation of the link between Royalism and feminism does not depend on the education level of Royalist women relative to Parliamentarian women.
Explanation B: B. Filmer most likely would have been critical of Cavendish’s ideas, had he encountered them, but the passage does not indicate that Gallagher’s argument had anything to do with whether Filmer read Cavendish’s writings.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Gallagher uses Cavendish’s work to explain how Royalism gave rise to feminism, but if Cavendish’s views were completely atypical of other Royalist women, then those views cannot explain the link as Gallagher suggests they do.
Explanation D: D. The passage states in the first paragraph that if the Royalists and Parliamentarians were in agreement on issues of family organization and women’s political rights, then feminists should have been divided between the two sides—but they were not. So this idea, if true, would undermine that statement, but not Gallagher’s argument about the link between Royalists and feminists.
Explanation E: E. If more Royalists were opposed to Filmer’s radical patriarchalism, then Cavendish’s writings would seem to be more representative of tendencies in Royalist ideology, thus making Gallagher’s case stronger, not weaker.

### Passage:
Frazier and Mosteller assert that medical research could be improved by a move toward larger, simpler clinical trials of medical treatments. Currently, researchers collect far more background information on patients than is strictly required for their trials— substantially more than hospitals collect—thereby escalating costs of data collection, storage, and analysis. Although limiting information collection could increase the risk that researchers will overlook facts relevant to a study, Frazier and Mosteller contend that such risk, never entirely eliminable from research, would still be small in most studies. Only in research on entirely new treatments are new and unexpected variables likely to arise.  Frazier and Mosteller propose not only that researchers limit data collection on individual patients but also that researchers enroll more patients in clinical trials, thereby obtaining a more representative sample of the total population with the disease under study. Often researchers restrict study participation to patients who have no ailments besides those being studied. A treatment judged successful under these ideal conditions can then be evaluated under normal conditions. Broadening the range of trial participants, Frazier and Mosteller suggest, would enable researchers to evaluate a treatment’s efficacy for diverse patients under various conditions and to evaluate its effectiveness for different patient subgroups. For example, the value of a treatment for a progressive disease may vary according to a patient’s stage of disease. Patients’ ages may also affect a treatment’s efficacy.

### Question:
The passage is primarily concerned with
A: A. identifying two practices in medical research that may affect the accuracy of clinical trials
B: B. describing aspects of medical research that tend to drive up costs
C: C. evaluating an analysis of certain shortcomings of current medical research practices

### Question:
Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about a study of the category of patients referred to in lines 20–22?
A: A. Its findings might have limited applicability.
B: B. It would be prohibitively expensive in its attempt to create ideal conditions.
C: C. It would be the best way to sample the total population of potential patients.
D: D. It would allow researchers to limit information collection without increasing the risk that important variables could be overlooked.
E: E. Its findings would be more accurate if it concerned treatments for a progressive disease than if it concerned treatments for a nonprogressive disease.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question requires drawing an inference from information given in the passage. In describing the proposals put forth by Frazier and Mosteller, the passage states in lines 15–20 that they propose using more patients in clinical trials than are currently being used, and that the trials would thereby obtain a more representative sample of the total population with the disease under study. The passage then states that researchers often restrict (lines 20–22) their trials to certain types of patients, therefore limiting the applicability of their findings.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage states that the researchers preferred to restrict the types of patients used in their studies, thereby using a less representative sample than if they used a more inclusive group of patients.
Explanation B: B. The passage mentions the added expense of clinical trials only in relation to data storage, collection, and analysis.
Explanation C: C. The passage describes the category of patients referred to as restricted and therefore unrepresentative of the total population.
Explanation D: D. While the passage does mention the amount of data collected about an individual patient, that topic is not connected to the category of patients referred to in lines 20–22.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not suggest that a study using the category of patients referred to would be more effective in investigating progressive diseases.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that a study limited to patients like those mentioned in lines 20–22 would have which of the following advantages over the kind of study proposed by Frazier and Mosteller?
A: A. It would yield more data, and its findings would be more accurate.
B: B. It would cost less in the long term, though it would be more expensive in its initial stages.
C: C. It would limit the number of variables researchers would need to consider when evaluating the treatment under study.
D: D. It would help researchers to identify subgroups of patients with secondary conditions that might also be treatable.
E: E. It would enable researchers to assess the value of an experimental treatment for the average patient.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question requires understanding what the information in the passage implies. The passage explains that Frazier and Mosteller’s proposal involves enrolling more patients in clinical trials (lines 18–19) than is the case with the category of patients referred to. The passage then explains that broadening the range of trial participants would allow an evaluation of particular treatments under various conditions and for different patient subgroups (line 29). This strongly suggests that limiting the patients used to those described in the referred text would limit the number of variables researchers would need to consider.
Explanation A: A. The passage suggests that not limiting the patients used in clinical trials will yield more data than restricting them will.
Explanation B: B. The passage refers to the costs of clinical trials only as they concern the collection, storage, and analysis of data collected from participants.
Explanation C: C. Correct. By limiting the patients used to those having the ailment under study, the passage suggests that researchers need to consider fewer variables in their assessment of a treatment.
Explanation D: D. The passage suggests that not limiting the types of patients used in clinical trials will better allow researchers to evaluate subgroups.
Explanation E: E. The passage suggests that limiting the types of patients available for clinical trials results in data for specific, rather than average, populations.

Evaluation Answering this question requires understanding how a particular piece of information functions in the passage as a whole. The passage is concerned with describing the proposals of Frazier and Mosteller. One of these proposals, described in the second paragraph, involves broadening the range of participants used in clinical trials. The passage states that in following this proposal, Frazier and Mosteller suggest that the effectiveness of treatments can be assessed for different patient subgroups. To affirm the value of broadening the range of participants, the passage then cites two examples of criteria by which relevant subgroups might be identified: disease stages and patients’ ages.
Explanation A: A. The passage makes no judgment as to the value of the subgroups it refers to in relation to broadened participation in clinical trials.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not call into question the potential effectiveness of Frazier and Mosteller’s proposals.
Explanation C: C. The passage’s example of patients’ ages is not intended to be causally connected to its previous example regarding progressive diseases.
Explanation D: D. Correct. Patients’ ages are referred to in the passage to identify subgroups that could be evaluated if the range of participants in clinical trials were broadened.
Explanation E: E. The passage refers to patients’ ages in support of Frazier and Mosteller’s proposal that more patients be used in clinical trials.

Supporting Idea This question asks for an identification of specific information given in the passage. The passage describes the proposals of Frazier and Mosteller as attempting to improve the way clinical trials have generally been conducted. In describing how current trials are generally conducted, the passage states that researchers collect far more background information on patients than is strictly required for their trials (lines 4–6) and that they therefore escalate the costs of the trials.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage states that researchers generally collect more information than they need to perform their clinical trials, which drives up the costs of the trials.
Explanation B: B. The passage makes no judgment about the accuracy of the information collected by researchers who currently hold clinical trials.
Explanation C: C. The passage states that the risk of overlooking relevant information in clinical trials is never entirely eliminable (line 11).
Explanation D: D. The passage states that researchers generally collect more information than is relevant, not that they overlook relevant information.
Explanation E: E. The passage states that, in general, researchers currently collect more information than hospitals do (line 6).

### Passage:
There are recent reports of apparently drastic declines in amphibian populations and of extinctions of a number of the world’s endangered amphibian species. These declines, if real, may be signs of a general trend toward extinction, and many environmentalists have claimed that immediate environmental action is necessary to remedy this “amphibian crisis,” which, in their view, is an indicator of general and catastrophic environmental degradation due to human activity.  To evaluate these claims, it is useful to make a preliminary distinction that is far too often ignored. A declining population should not be confused with an endangered one. An endangered population is always rare, almost always small, and, by definition, under constant threat of extinction even without a proximate cause in human activities. Its disappearance, however unfortunate, should come as no great surprise. Moreover, chance events—which may indicate nothing about the direction of trends in population size—may lead to its extinction. The probability of extinction due to such random factors depends on the population size and is independent of the prevailing direction of change in that size.  For biologists, population declines are potentially more worrisome than extinctions. Persistent declines, especially in large populations, indicate a changed ecological context. Even here, distinctions must again be made among declines that are only apparent (in the sense that they are part of habitual cycles or of normal fluctuations), declines that take a population to some lower but still acceptable level, and those that threaten extinction (e.g., by taking the number of individuals below the minimum viable population). Anecdotal reports of population decreases cannot distinguish among these possibilities, and some amphibian populations have shown strong fluctuations in the past.  It is indisputably true that there is simply not enough long-term scientific data on amphibian populations to enable researchers to identify real declines in amphibian populations. Many fairly common amphibian species declared all but extinct after severe declines in the 1950s and 1960s have subsequently recovered, and so might the apparently declining populations that have generated the current appearance of an amphibian crisis. Unfortunately, long-term data will not soon be forthcoming, and postponing environmental action while we wait for it may doom species and whole ecosystems to extinction.

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. assess the validity of a certain view
B: B. distinguish between two phenomena

D: D. describe a disturbing trend
E: E. allay concern about a particular phenomenon

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question requires understanding, in general terms, the purpose of the passage as a whole. The first paragraph identifies an area of concern: declines in amphibian populations may constitute a crisis, one that indicates humans’ catastrophic effects on the environment. The rest of the passage then goes on to evaluate, as the second paragraph states, whether claims of crisis-level extinctions as a result of human activity are valid. In making this evaluation, the passage discusses the possible causes of extinctions, biologists’ prioritization of population declines over extinctions, and the fact that we lack extensive long-term data on amphibian populations.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage’s main purpose is to assess whether the view that humans are causing crisis-level declines in amphibian populations is valid.
Explanation B: B. The passage takes care, particularly in the third paragraph, to distinguish between population declines and extinctions, but this is not its primary purpose.
Explanation C: C. The passage makes clear that it is difficult to identify the real extent of the problem facing amphibian populations, much less identify its causes.
Explanation D: D. The first paragraph notes what may seem to be a disturbing trend—the decline in amphibian populations—but the rest of the passage is concerned not with describing that trend in greater detail, but rather with determining whether it is in fact occurring.
Explanation E: E. While the passage provides possible grounds for concluding that concern about declining amphibian populations is overblown, it concludes by suggesting that we might, because we lack data, doom species and ecosystems to extinction. Thus, the overall purpose is not to allay concern.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that the author believes which of the following to be true of the environmentalists mentioned in lines 5–6?
A: A. They have wrongly chosen to focus on anecdotal reports rather than on the long-term data that are currently available concerning amphibians.
B: B. Their recommendations are flawed because their research focuses too narrowly on a single category of animal species.
C: C. Their certainty that population declines in general are caused by environmental degradation is not warranted.
D: D. They have drawn premature conclusions concerning a crisis in amphibian populations from recent reports of declines.
E: E. They have overestimated the effects of chance events on trends in amphibian populations.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question asks about the author’s view of the environmentalists mentioned in the first paragraph. These environmentalists have claimed, based on amphibian population declines, that the situation is a crisis and that immediate action must be taken. The author, however, states that the declines are only apparently drastic and questions whether they are real, thus suggesting that the environmentalists are drawing conclusions in the absence of a complete consideration of the situation.
Explanation A: A. The passage indicates that anecdotal reports are insufficient, but so too are other resources. The fourth paragraph of the passage makes clear that there is not enough long-term data available on which to base conclusions about amphibian populations.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not indicate that the environmentalists under discussion have conducted research on any animal species.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate that the environmentalists in question hold, with certainty, any particular view regarding population declines in general.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The author argues that the recent declines may have several different causes, and that environmentalists have jumped to a conclusion about the cause of the declines as well as their significance.
Explanation E: E. The environmentalists, in attributing population declines to intentional human activity, have more likely underestimated than overestimated the effects of chance events on amphibian populations.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that the author believes which of the following to be true of the amphibian extinctions that have recently been reported?
A: A. They have resulted primarily from human activities causing environmental degradation.
B: B. They could probably have been prevented if timely action had been taken to protect the habitats of amphibian species.
C: C. They should not come as a surprise, because amphibian populations generally have been declining for a number of years.
D: D. They have probably been caused by a combination of chance events.
E: E. They do not clearly constitute evidence of general environmental degradation.

### Response:
<think>
Inference The author suggests throughout the passage that recently reported amphibian extinctions may have several different causes: they may be due to any number of chance events, for example, or may simply be the result of a small population that finds itself unable to continue under difficult conditions, whatever causes those conditions.
Explanation A: A. The author states in the second paragraph that extinctions may occur without a proximate cause in human activities and does not make a commitment to any particular explanation of the amphibian extinctions.
Explanation B: B. That chance events can cause extinctions suggests that even if habitats had been protected, extinctions still might have occurred.
Explanation C: C. In the second paragraph, the author says that extinctions should come as no great surprise, but this option is imprecise. The amphibian populations have not generally been declining for a number of years. The author says in the third paragraph that amphibian populations show strong fluctuations; further, in the fourth paragraph, the author says that there is insufficient long-term data to conclude that amphibian populations have been, or are, in decline.
Explanation D: D. The author suggests that the extinctions may have been caused by chance events, but there is not enough data to know whether or not this is probable.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The reported extinctions could have resulted from several different causes; thus, they are not clear evidence of general environmental degradation.

### Passage:
There are recent reports of apparently drastic declines in amphibian populations and of extinctions of a number of the world’s endangered amphibian species. These declines, if real, may be signs of a general trend toward extinction, and many environmentalists have claimed that immediate environmental action is necessary to remedy this “amphibian crisis,” which, in their view, is an indicator of general and catastrophic environmental degradation due to human activity.  To evaluate these claims, it is useful to make a preliminary distinction that is far too often ignored.

### Question:
According to the passage, each of the following is true of endangered amphibian species EXCEPT:
A: A. They are among the rarest kinds of amphibians.
B: B. They generally have populations that are small in size.
C: C. They are in constant danger of extinction.
D: D. Those with decreasing populations are the most likely candidates for immediate extinction.
E: E. They are in danger of extinction due to events that sometimes have nothing to do with human activities.

### Response:
<think>
Application This question asks what the passage does not say is true of endangered amphibian species. The second paragraph discusses endangered species, stating that they are always rare, almost always small, and, by definition, under constant threat of extinction, which may be caused by chance events. The possibility of their extinction, the passage states, depends only on the population size, and not whether that population is increasing or decreasing.
Explanation A: A. The second paragraph mentions rarity as a characteristic of endangered amphibian species.
Explanation B: B. According to the second paragraph, endangered amphibian species are generally those of small populations.
Explanation C: C. The second paragraph states that an endangered population is under constant threat of extinction.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The last sentence of the second paragraph states that the probability of extinction due to chance events is independent of how a population changes in size. Immediate extinction would more likely come from such events, whereas population decline is gradual, even if fairly rapid.
Explanation E: E. Endangered species, according to the second paragraph, may become extinct due to chance events—that is, events that have nothing to do with human activities.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question asks about the organization of the passage as a whole. In the first paragraph, the author tells about a situation that has been interpreted in a particular way by environmentalists. The passage then proceeds to consider whether that interpretation is valid, and while it does not come to a definitive conclusion on that point, the final paragraph warns about the possible consequences of not taking the action recommended by the environmentalists.
Explanation A: A. The passage does initially raise a question regarding whether the environmentalists’ interpretation of events is valid, but it does not answer that question, for the appropriate long-term data are not available.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage presents environmentalists’ interpretation of recent news regarding amphibians, then examines the soundness of that interpretation. Finally, the author warns that postponing environmental action may have disastrous consequences.
Explanation C: C. The first paragraph describes a situation of possibly drastic declines in amphibian populations but does not follow this description with an analysis of its consequences.
Explanation D: D. The passage suggests that apparent declines in amphibian populations may or may not constitute a crisis, but it does not reject either idea.
Explanation E: E. While the passage does imply, in its final paragraph, that long-term data on amphibian populations should be collected, the passage does not compare two methods for analyzing amphibian populations or population declines in those populations.

### Question:

D: D. To provide support for a view presented in the first paragraph
E: E. To introduce an idea that will be countered in the following paragraph

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation The sentence in question discusses the way in which anecdotal reports of population decreases cannot help biologists determine whether those decreases are normal fluctuations, take populations to lower levels that are not actually worrisome, or actually threaten extinctions. This indicates that the view mentioned in the first paragraph—reports of declines indicate a catastrophic crisis—may be mistaken.
Explanation A: A. The sentence does not address a particular kind of study; it objects to the use of anecdotal reports in place of actual study.
Explanation B: B. The previous sentence describes the possibilities referred to in the sentence in question. The sentence does not cast doubt on any of those possibilities.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The view that reports of amphibian population declines indicate a crisis, as presented in the first paragraph, is countered by the objection here that there are several possible causes for population declines, and anecdotal reports cannot distinguish among those possibilities.
Explanation D: D. The first paragraph is concerned with articulating the view that amphibian population declines constitute a crisis. This sentence does not support that view; instead, it offers reason to question it.
Explanation E: E. The sentence introduces the idea that amphibian populations have fluctuated in the past, and the following paragraph supports this idea by stating that several amphibian species that appeared almost extinct in the 1950s and 1960s have recovered. Thus, the paragraph does not counter the sentence.
</think>
C Main Idea Summary The main idea of the passage is that attempts to identify keystone species are complicated by multiple factors, including the difficulty of directly testing for keystone status with controlled experiments and the fact that keystone status appears to depend in complex ways on the contexts in which the species are found. The passage defines a keystone species as one whose effects on its ecosystem are much larger than would be predicted from its abundance. It notes that testing for keystone status by removing species from their environment and observing the effects of their absence is problematic. It then discusses one species of starfish to exemplify the difficulties inherent in determining whether a species is a keystone one. Drawing on those examples, the passage describes some ways in which keystone status depends on species’ contexts."

Focus on understanding the main idea, supporting details, author's purpose, and inferences that can be drawn from the passage. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
While the most abundant and dominant species within a particular ecosystem is often crucial in perpetuating the ecosystem, a “keystone” species, here defined as one whose effects are much larger than would be predicted from its abundance, can also play a vital role. But because complex species interactions may be involved, identifying a keystone species by removing the species and observing changes in the ecosystem is problematic. It might seem that certain traits would clearly define a species as a keystone species; for example, Pisaster ochraceus is often a keystone predator because it consumes and suppresses mussel populations, which in the absence of this starfish can be a dominant species. But such predation on a dominant or potentially dominant species occurs in systems that do as well as in systems that do not have species that play keystone roles. Moreover, whereas P. ochraceus occupies an unambiguous keystone role on wave-exposed rocky headlands, in more wave-sheltered habitats the impact of P. ochraceus predation is weak or nonexistent, and at certain sites sand burial is responsible for eliminating mussels. Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of such factors as community diversity (for example, a reduction in species diversity may thrust more of the remaining species into keystone roles) and length of species interaction (since newly arrived species in particular may dramatically affect ecosystems).

### Question:
The passage mentions which of the following as a factor that affects the role of P  ochraceus as a keystone species within different habitats?
A: A. The degree to which the habitat is sheltered from waves
B: B. The degree to which other animals within a habitat prey on mussels
C: C. The fact that mussel populations are often not dominant within some habitats occupied by P. ochraceus
D: D. The size of the P. ochraceus population within the habitat
E: E. The fact that there is great species diversity within some habitats occupied by P. ochraceus

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question depends on recognizing what the passage states about the factors affecting P. ochraceus’s role as a keystone species, which is different in different habitats. According to the passage, P. ochraceus consumes and suppresses mussel populations in some habitats— specifically, those that are wave-exposed—making it a keystone predator in those habitats. But in wave-sheltered habitats, P. ochraceus does not play the same role in suppressing mussel populations.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage clearly states that P. ochraceus’s role in wave-exposed habitats differs from its role in wave-sheltered habitats.
Explanation B: B. The passage says that the impact of P. ochraceus predation on mussels is not strong in wave-sheltered habitats, but this is not the case—at least not at all sites—because other animals are preying on the mussels; rather, at least at some sites, it is because mussels are controlled by sand burial.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not suggest that mussel populations are dominant in any habitats occupied by P. ochraceus.
Explanation D: D. The size of the P. ochraceus population affects the size of the mussel population within wave-exposed habitats, but the passage does not suggest that P. ochraceus’s role as a keystone species depends on the size of its population within those habitats.
Explanation E: E. The only other species the passage mentions in conjunction with P. ochraceus habitats is the mussel; the passage does not address species diversity in these habitats.

Which of the following hypothetical experiments most clearly exemplifies the method of identifying species’ roles that the author considers problematic?
A: A. A population of seals in an Arctic habitat is counted in order to determine whether it is the dominant species in that ecosystem.
B: B. A species of fish that is a keystone species in one marine ecosystem is introduced into another marine ecosystem to see whether the species will come to occupy a keystone role.
C: C. In order to determine whether a species of monkey is a keystone species within a particular ecosystem, the monkeys are removed from that ecosystem and the ecosystem is then studied.
D: D. Different mountain ecosystems are compared to determine how geography affects a particular species’ ability to dominate its ecosystem.
E: E. In a grassland experiencing a changing climate, patterns of species extinction are traced in order to evaluate the effect of climate changes on keystone species in that grassland.

### Response:
<think>
Application Answering this question depends on recognizing what the author says about identifying species’ roles in habitats and then extending that to another situation. The author considers a particular method of studying keystone species problematic: removing a suspected keystone species from its habitat and observing what happens to the ecosystem. The author finds this problematic because interactions among species are complex.
Explanation A: A. The author does not discuss counting the members of a population as a problematic way of determining whether that population is a dominant species.
Explanation B: B. The method that the author finds problematic has to do with observing what happens to an ecosystem when a keystone species is removed from it, not with observing what happens to a different ecosystem when the species is introduced into it.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The author states explicitly that removing a species from a habitat in order to determine its keystone status is problematic. Removing the monkeys from their habitat is a clear example of this problematic practice.
Explanation D: D. Comparison of habitats in order to determine geography’s effect on a particular species’ dominance would most likely find favor with the author, for this is the approach the author seems to advocate in investigating P. ochraceus’s keystone status.
Explanation E: E. The author does not discuss tracing patterns of extinction or changing climates in the passage.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, would most clearly support the argument about keystone status advanced in the last sentence of the passage (lines 24–31)?
A: A. A species of bat is primarily responsible for keeping insect populations within an ecosystem low, and the size of the insect population in turn affects bird species within that ecosystem.
B: B. A species of iguana occupies a keystone role on certain tropical islands but does not play that role on adjacent tropical islands that are inhabited by a greater number of animal species.
C: C. Close observation of a savannah ecosystem reveals that more species occupy keystone roles within that ecosystem than biologists had previously believed.
D: D. As a keystone species of bee becomes more abundant, it has a larger effect on the ecosystem it inhabits.
E: E. A species of moth that occupies a keystone role in a prairie habitat develops coloration patterns that camouflage it from potential predators.

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation To answer this question, focus on the argument advanced in the last sentence of the passage and identify what information would support that argument. In the last sentence of the passage, the author claims that keystone status depends on context. The author then offers three contextual factors that may affect a species’ keystone status: geography, community diversity (i.e., the number of species in a given habitat), and length of species interaction. Evidence supporting this argument would show that context is important to a species’ keystone status.
Explanation A: A. This scenario does not indicate anything about keystone status; this is simply a description of how species populations in a single ecosystem affect one another.
Explanation B: B. Correct. That the iguana is a keystone species in a location that has limited species diversity but not a keystone species in a location that has greater species diversity suggests that keystone status does indeed depend on context. Thus, this example supports the author’s argument in the last sentence of the passage.
Explanation C: C. That biologists were mistaken about keystone species in a particular ecosystem does not have a bearing on whether keystone status is context dependent.
Explanation D: D. It is not surprising that an increase in a species’ population would lead to that species having a larger effect on its ecosystem—but this does not speak directly to the question of whether keystone status itself depends on context.
Explanation E: E. A keystone species enhancing its ability to survive in a single ecosystem does not lend any support to the idea that keystone status depends on context. The moth’s keystone status would have to undergo some change for this to have a bearing on the question of context.

The passage suggests which of the following about the identification of a species as a keystone species?
A: A. Such an identification depends primarily on the species’ relationship to the dominant species.
B: B. Such an identification can best be made by removing the species from a particular ecosystem and observing changes that occur in the ecosystem.
C: C. Such an identification is likely to be less reliable as an ecosystem becomes less diverse.
D: D. Such an identification seems to depend on various factors within the ecosystem.
E: E. Such an identification can best be made by observing predation behavior.

### Response:
<think>
Inference Answering this question requires identifying how the passage suggests that keystone species should be identified. The passage identifies a particular way in which keystone status should not be determined: removing a species and observing what happens to the ecosystem. The passage also argues that keystone status depends strongly on context: that is, an ecosystem’s characteristics, including its geography and inhabitants, determine its keystone species.
Explanation A: A. While the passage uses an example of a keystone species, P. ochraceus, which preys on a species that would, in the keystone species’ absence, be dominant, there is nothing to suggest that a keystone species must have a particular relationship with the dominant, or potentially dominant, species in an ecosystem.
Explanation B: B. The passage explicitly states that this method of identification would be problematic.
Explanation C: C. A reduction in an ecosystem’s diversity might alter which species occupy keystone roles in that ecosystem, the passage suggests, but there is no indication that identifying such species would become more difficult.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If, as the passage suggests, keystone status for any given species depends on the context of the ecosystem in which it lives, then it is likely that identifying keystone species depends strongly on understanding what factors of the ecosystem contribute to creating keystone status. The passage lists such factors as geography, community diversity, and species interaction.
Explanation E: E. While the passage uses a predator, P. ochraceus, as its example of a keystone species, there is no indication that predation is an essential component of the actual definition of keystone species (one whose effects are much larger than would be predicted from its abundance).
</think>
D Main Idea Summary The first paragraph of the passage indicates that the 1981 discovery of fossil remains of the tiny soft-bodied animals known as conodonts shed light on hypotheses regarding the development of vertebrate skeletons. The second paragraph states that the traditional view was that the vertebrate skeleton had developed as a defensive mechanism and that teeth were secondary features. The paragraph mentions, however, that other paleontologists argued that certain characteristics of vertebrates would not have evolved had the vertebrates not been predators and that teeth were more primitive than external armor. The final paragraph argues that certain features of conodonts suggest that hard parts first evolved in the mouth to improve predation, and aggression rather than protection drove the origin of the vertebrate skeleton. Supporting these latter claims is the primary purpose of the passage."

Conodonts, the spiky phosphatic remains (bones and teeth composed of calcium phosphate) of tiny marine animals that probably appeared about 520 million years ago, were once among the most controversial of fossils. Both the nature of the organism to which the remains belonged and the function of the remains were unknown. However, since the 1981 discovery of fossils preserving not just the phosphatic elements but also other remains of the tiny soft-bodied animals (also called conodonts) that bore them, scientists’ reconstructions of the animals’ anatomy have had important implications for hypotheses concerning the development of the vertebrate skeleton.  The vertebrate skeleton had traditionally been regarded as a defensive development, champions of this view postulating that it was only with the much later evolution of jaws that vertebrates became predators. The first vertebrates, which were softbodied, would have been easy prey for numerous invertebrate carnivores, especially if these early vertebrates were sedentary suspension feeders. Thus, traditionalists argued, these animals developed coverings of bony scales or plates, and teeth were secondary features, adapted from the protective bony scales. Indeed, external skeletons of this type are common among the well-known fossils of ostracoderms, jawless vertebrates that existed from approximately 500 to 400 million years ago. However, other paleontologists argued that many of the definitive characteristics of vertebrates, such as paired eyes and muscular and skeletal adaptations for active life, would not have evolved unless the first vertebrates were predatory. Teeth were more primitive than external armor according to this view, and the earliest vertebrates were predators.  The stiffening notochord along the back of the body, V-shaped muscle blocks along the sides, and posterior tail fins help to identify conodonts as among the most primitive of vertebrates. The lack of any mineralized structures apart from the elements in the mouth indicates that conodonts were more primitive than the armored jawless fishes such as the ostracoderms. It now appears that the hard parts that first evolved in the mouth of an animal improved its efficiency as a predator, and that aggression rather than protection was the driving force behind the origin of the vertebrate skeleton.

### Question:
According to the passage, the anatomical evidence provided by the preserved soft bodies of conodonts led scientists to conclude that
A: A. conodonts had actually been invertebrate carnivores
B: B. conodonts’ teeth were adapted from protective bony scales
C: C. conodonts were primitive vertebrate suspension feeders
D: D. primitive vertebrates with teeth appeared earlier than armored vertebrates
E: E. scientists’ original observations concerning the phosphatic remains of conodonts were essentially correct

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question depends on understanding how a particular type of evidence—the preserved soft bodies of conodonts—supports a particular conclusion stated in the passage. The third paragraph makes this relationship explicit, explaining that certain features of conodonts show them to be more primitive than other vertebrates. Further, those features indicate that they came before ostracoderms and other armored jawless fishes. These remains support the conclusion stated in the second paragraph regarding teeth being more primitive than external armor.
Explanation A: A. The passage states explicitly that conodonts were not invertebrates but rather vertebrates.
Explanation B: B. This view is attributed to certain traditionalists but is contradicted by other paleontological evidence presented in the second and third paragraphs. According to the third paragraph, the evidence provided by the preserved soft bodies of conodonts undermines this traditional view.
Explanation C: C. The final sentence of the passage indicates that the evidence in question supports the conclusion that conodonts were predators rather than suspension feeders.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The third paragraph explains how conodonts’ remains support the conclusion that teeth were more primitive than external armor.
Explanation E: E. The second paragraph explains that originally, scientists thought that early vertebrates were not predators—but the remainder of the passage indicates that this idea is inconsistent with more recent evidence described in the passage.

### Question:
The second paragraph in the passage serves primarily to
A: A. outline the significance of the 1981 discovery of conodont remains to the debate concerning the development of the vertebrate skeleton
B: B. contrast the traditional view of the development of the vertebrate skeleton with a view derived from the 1981 discovery of conodont remains
C: C. contrast the characteristics of the ostracoderms with the characteristics of earlier soft- bodied vertebrates
D: D. explain the importance of the development of teeth among the earliest vertebrate predators
E: E. present the two sides of the debate concerning the development of the vertebrate skeleton

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question depends on understanding the second paragraph in the context of the passage as a whole. The second paragraph begins by noting the traditional view of the vertebrate skeleton—that it was a defense against predators—and then goes on to explain that other paleontologists argued against this idea, claiming instead that vertebrates began as predators and that teeth were a more primary feature than external armor.
Explanation A: A. The second paragraph focuses on describing the debate rather than on the distinctive contribution of the 1981 discovery to that debate.
Explanation B: B. The second paragraph does not explicitly indicate whether the opposition to the traditional view originally rested on the 1981 discovery of conodont remains. In fact, the surrounding discussion, in the first and third paragraphs, suggests that the discovery in 1981 turned out to support the opposing view, which some paleontologists already held at that time.
Explanation C: C. The mention of ostracoderms in the second paragraph merely serves to indicate how the traditionalists’ arguments might have seemed plausible. The paragraph as a whole is not devoted to contrasting the ostracoderms with earlier soft-bodied vertebrates.
Explanation D: D. The development of teeth figures in the second paragraph, but this development is mentioned first as a feature that some believed to have been adapted from protective scales; only the final sentence of the paragraph connects teeth to early vertebrate predators.
Explanation E: E. Correct. According to the passage, the debate concerning the development of the vertebrate skeleton hinges on whether vertebrates began as predators, with teeth, or whether skeletal defenses such as external armor evolved first. The primary purpose of the second paragraph is to distinguish these two sides.

### Question:
It can be inferred that on the basis of the 1981 discovery of conodont remains, paleontologists could draw which of the following conclusions?
A: A. The earliest vertebrates were sedentary suspension feeders.
B: B. Ostracoderms were not the earliest vertebrates.
C: C. Defensive armor preceded jaws among vertebrates.
D: D. Paired eyes and adaptations for activity are definitive characteristics of vertebrates.
E: E. Conodonts were unlikely to have been predators.

### Response:
<think>
Inference What could paleontologists conclude, based on the 1981 discovery of conodont remains? That discovery, according to the passage, supported the view of certain paleontologists that the earliest vertebrates were predators with teeth—unlike the ostracoderms, which had no jaws.
Explanation A: A. According to the second paragraph, traditionalists believed that early vertebrates were sedentary suspension feeders. But the 1981 discovery supported the hypothesis that early vertebrates were predators instead.
Explanation B: B. Correct. According to the third paragraph, the conodonts’ body structures indicated that they were more primitive than the ostracoderms, so the ostracoderms must not have been the earliest vertebrates.
Explanation C: C. Traditionalists argued that teeth were adapted from bony scales that provided defensive armor, but the 1981 discovery suggested that teeth preceded such scales.
Explanation D: D. Paleontologists knew prior to the 1981 discovery that paired eyes and other adaptations are characteristics of vertebrates. They used this knowledge to help them interpret the 1981 discovery.
Explanation E: E. The third paragraph indicates that conodonts, given their teeth, were most likely predators.

### Passage:
Jon Clark’s study of the effect of the modernization of a telephone exchange on exchange maintenance work and workers is a solid contribution to a debate that encompasses two lively issues in the history and sociology of technology: technological determinism and social constructivism.  Clark makes the point that the characteristics of a technology have a decisive influence on job skills and work organization. Put more strongly, technology can be a primary determinant of social and managerial organization. Clark believes this possibility has been obscured by the recent sociological fashion, exemplified by Braverman’s analysis, that emphasizes the way machinery reflects social choices. For Braverman, the shape of a technological system is subordinate to the manager’s desire to wrest control of the labor process from the workers. Technological change is construed as the outcome of negotiations among interested parties who seek to incorporate their own interests into the design and configuration of the machinery. This position represents the new mainstream called social constructivism.  The constructivists gain acceptance by misrepresenting technological determinism: technological determinists are supposed to believe, for example, that machinery imposes appropriate forms of order on society. The alternative to constructivism, in other words, is to view technology as existing outside society, capable of directly influencing skills and work organization.  Clark refutes the extremes of the constructivists by both theoretical and empirical arguments. Theoretically, he defines “technology” in terms of relationships between social and technical variables. Attempts to reduce the meaning of technology to cold, hard metal are bound to fail, for machinery is just scrap unless it is organized functionally and supported by appropriate systems of operation and maintenance. At the empirical level, Clark shows how a change at the telephone exchange from maintenance-intensive electromechanical switches to semielectronic switching systems altered work tasks, skills, training opportunities, administration, and organization of workers. Some changes Clark attributes to the particular way management and labor unions negotiated the introduction of the technology, whereas others are seen as arising from the capabilities and nature of the technology itself. Thus, Clark helps answer the question: “When is social choice decisive and when are the concrete characteristics of technology more important?”

### Question:
The primary purpose of the passage is to
A: A. advocate a more positive attitude toward technological change
B: B. discuss the implications for employees of the modernization of a telephone exchange
C: C. consider a successful challenge to the constructivist view of technological change
D: D. challenge the position of advocates of technological determinism
E: E. suggest that the social causes of technological change should be studied in real situations

### Response:
<think>
Main Idea This question asks for an assessment of what the passage as a whole is doing. The passage introduces Clark’s study as a solid contribution (line 3) to the debate between technological determinists and social constructivists. In the second paragraph, Braverman is introduced as holding a position of social constructivism, a position that Clark takes issue with. In the final paragraph, the passage holds that Clark refutes the extremes of the constructivists (line 31), and Clark’s arguments challenging social constructivism are then described.
Explanation A: A. The passage takes no position on the merits of technological change but is concerned only with the role of such change in society.
Explanation B: B. The passage mentions telephone exchange workers as an example that helps illustrate the more central debate between determinists and constructivists.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage is mainly concerned with portraying Clark’s view as a successful challenge to constructivism.
Explanation D: D. The passage describes Clark’s view as a successful challenge to social constructivism, not technological determinism.
Explanation E: E. The passage is concerned with describing a challenge to social constructivism and not with suggesting the context in which technological change ought to be studied.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question requires recognizing information contained in the passage. The passage states in the first paragraph that Clark’s study focused on the modernization of a telephone exchange and the effect this had on maintenance work and workers. After describing Braverman’s analysis in the second paragraph as being at odds with Clark’s views, the passage discusses Clark’s views in more detail in the final paragraph. As part of this discussion, the passage notes that Clark shows how a change from maintenance-intensive electromechanical switches to semielectronic switching systems at the telephone exchange altered work tasks, skills, training opportunities, administration, and organization of workers (lines 42–44). Thus, the passage shows that the modernization of the telephone exchange affected much more than maintenance routines.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not discuss whether new technology reduces the role of managers in labor negotiations.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not discuss the role of employee consent in the modernization of the telephone exchange.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The passage states that the modernization of the telephone exchange affected tasks, skills, training, administration, and the organization of workers.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not suggest that maintenance workers felt victimized by the modernization of the telephone exchange.
Explanation E: E. The passage describes modernization as a fact viewable from a perspective of social constructivism or technological determinism, but that does not in itself support either view.

E: E. He is sympathetic to its concern about the impact of modern technology on workers.

### Response:
<think>
Inference Answering this question requires inferring what the passage’s author likely believes. The passage describes Braverman’s position as one of mainstream social constructivism (lines 23– 24), a position that Clark takes issue with. Although it describes Braverman’s position, the rest of the passage is devoted to showing how Clark’s position takes issue with Braverman’s. In the second paragraph, the passage describes Clark as holding that technology can be a primary determinant of social and managerial organization (lines 9–11), which suggests that managers are sometimes subordinate to technological change. In lines 15–17, however, Braverman is described as holding that the shape of a technological system is subordinate to the manager’s desire to wrest control of the labor process from the workers, which shows that Clark and Braverman are at odds on this point.
Explanation A: A. Since the passage says that Clark believes an important insight has been obscured by the recent sociological fashion that Braverman’s views exemplify (lines 11–14), one cannot infer that Clark respects the popularity of Braverman’s views.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The passage shows that Clark believes managers to have less influence over how technology affects an organization than Braverman claims that they have.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate that Clark admires any aspect of Braverman’s position.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not indicate that Clark considers impediments to modernization.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not indicate that Clark is sympathetic to any concerns attributed to Braverman.

Application This question requires understanding different points of view discussed in the passage. In the first paragraph, the passage mentions the debate involving technological determinism and social constructivism. In the second and third paragraphs, the passage uses Braverman’s analysis to illustrate the social constructivists’ position and in the third paragraph suggests that the constructivists are misrepresenting technological determinism (line 24). In lines 29–30, the constructivists are reported to hold that technological determinism views technology as existing outside society, capable of directly influencing skills and work organization.
Explanation A: A. Correct. This statement is consistent with the constructivists’ view that technological determinism sees technology as outside of society, influencing workers’ skills.
Explanation B: B. The passage states that the constructivists hold that technological determinists are supposed to believe . . . that machinery imposes appropriate forms of order on society (lines 25–27), suggesting that no negotiation is present.
Explanation C: C. According to the description of them in the passage, constructivists portray technological determinists as believing that technology, not people, drives organizational change.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not portray either constructivists or determinists as being concerned with technological research and development.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not portray either constructivists or determinists as being concerned with technology-driven job elimination or creation.

### Passage:
Jon Clark’s study of the effect of the modernization of a telephone exchange on exchange maintenance work and workers is a solid contribution to a debate that encompasses two lively issues in the history and sociology of technology: technological determinism and social constructivism.  Clark makes the point that the characteristics of a technology have a decisive influence on job skills and work organization. Put more strongly, technology can be a primary determinant of social and managerial organization. Clark believes this possibility has been obscured by the recent sociological fashion, exemplified by Braverman’s analysis, that emphasizes the way machinery reflects social choices. For Braverman, the shape of a technological system is subordinate to the manager’s desire to wrest control of the labor process from the workers. Technological change is construed as the outcome of negotiations among interested parties who seek to incorporate their own interests into the design and configuration of the machinery. This position represents the new mainstream called social constructivism.  The constructivists gain acceptance by misrepresenting technological determinism: technological determinists are supposed to believe, for example, that machinery imposes appropriate forms of order on society. The alternative to constructivism, in other words, is to view technology as existing outside society, capable of directly influencing skills and work organization.  Clark refutes the extremes of the constructivists by both theoretical and empirical arguments. Theoretically, he defines “technology” in terms of relationships between social and technical variables. Attempts to reduce the meaning of technology to cold, hard metal are bound to fail, for machinery is just scrap unless it is organized functionally and supported by appropriate systems of operation and maintenance. At the empirical level, Clark shows how a change at the telephone exchange from maintenance-intensive electromechanical switches to semielectronic switching systems altered work tasks, skills, training opportunities, administration, and organization of workers. Some changes Clark attributes to the particular way management and labor unions negotiated the introduction of the technology, whereas others are seen as arising from the capabilities and nature of the technology itself. Thus, Clark helps answer the question: “When is social choice decisive and when are the concrete characteristics of technology more important?”

### Question:
According to the passage, constructivists employed which of the following to promote their argument?
A: A. Empirical studies of business situations involving technological change
B: B. Citation of managers supportive of their position
C: C. Construction of hypothetical situations that support their view
D: D. Contrasts of their view with a misstatement of an opposing view
E: E. Descriptions of the breadth of impact of technological change

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea Answering this question involves recognizing information given in the passage. The passage indicates that a debate exists between technological determinists and social constructivists, suggesting that these views are in opposition. The passage goes on to state that constructivists gain acceptance by misrepresenting technological determinism (lines 23–24). This misrepresentation is presented as the alternative to constructivism (lines 27–28), suggesting that constructivists promoted their own view by contrasting it with a misrepresentation of determinists’ views.
Explanation A: A. The passage mentions empirical studies in relation to Clark’s study but not Braverman’s analysis.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not mention that managers were supportive of any particular point of view within the sociology of technology.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not mention any hypothetical situations as being used by the constructivists in support of their view.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The passage indicates that the constructivists have come into fashion by contrasting their own views with a misrepresentation of the views of technological determinists.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not describe the constructivists as making determinations regarding the degree of impact that technological change has on social or managerial organization.

Evaluation This question requires understanding how a particular phrase functions in the passage as a whole. In the third paragraph, the passage states that constructivists gain acceptance by misrepresenting technological determinism (lines 23–24) and follows this claim with an example of this misrepresentation, stating that technological determinists are supposed to believe, for example (lines 25–26). This line implies that the constructivist view of the determinists is inaccurate.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage uses the expression in part to provide an example of the constructivists’ misrepresentation of the determinists.
Explanation B: B. The passage indicates that the view attributed to the determinists is a misrepresentation, not one that is generally accepted by determinists.
Explanation C: C. The expression in the passage is part of a discussion about the motivation of constructivists, not determinists.
Explanation D: D. The expression in the passage is part of a discussion that is critical of the constructivists, not the determinists.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not describe either the historical position of determinists or their position on the exchange modernization.

### Question:
Which of the following statements about Clark’s study of the telephone exchange can be inferred from information in the passage?
A: A. Clark’s reason for undertaking the study was to undermine Braverman’s analysis of the function of technology.
B: B. Clark’s study suggests that the implementation of technology should be discussed in the context of conflict between labor and management.
C: C. Clark examined the impact of changes in the technology of switching at the exchange in terms of overall operations and organization.
D: D. Clark concluded that the implementation of new switching technology was equally beneficial to management and labor.
E: E. Clark’s analysis of the change in switching systems applies only narrowly to the situation at the particular exchange that he studied.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question requires understanding what the passage implies in its discussion of a point of view. The details of Clark’s views are discussed primarily in the final paragraph. The passage states that on an empirical level, Clark demonstrates that technological change regarding switches at the telephone exchange altered work tasks, skills, training opportunities, administration, and organization of workers (lines 42–44). The passage goes on to state Clark’s contention that these changes even influenced negotiations between management and labor unions.
Explanation A: A. The passage indicates that Clark’s study addressed the extremes of both technological determinism and social constructivism. It cites Braverman as a proponent of social constructivism but provides no evidence that Clark’s motivation in beginning his study was specifically to target an analysis offered by Braverman.
Explanation B: B. The passage indicates that Clark attributed some organizational change to the way labor and management negotiated the introduction of technology but does not mention conflict between them.
Explanation C: C. Correct. According to the passage, Clark concludes that changes to the technology of switches had an influence on several aspects of the overall operations and organization of the telephone exchange.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not indicate that Clark assesses the benefits of technological change to either labor or management.
Explanation E: E. The passage indicates that Clark believes the change in switching technology influenced many aspects of the overall operations of the telephone exchange.

C Main Idea Summary The central question addressed by the passage is whether, during the period 1794 to 1830, judges in the United States were prejudiced against patent holders. After a brief introduction to the history of patents, the author presents some purported evidence that the courts during this period had an antipatent bias. The passage then presents some considerations that weigh against such a conclusion. The main idea of the passage, implied in the chain of reasoning in the second paragraph but not explicitly stated, is that the pattern of judgments against patentees during the period in question was probably due to the fact that many patents had been awarded without merit rather than to an antipatent bias of the judges."

### Passage:
Because the framers of the United States Constitution (written in 1787) believed that protecting property rights relating to inventions would encourage the new nation’s economic growth, they gave Congress—the national legislature—a constitutional mandate to grant patents for inventions. The resulting patent system has served as a model for those in other nations. Recently, however, scholars have questioned whether the American system helped achieve the framers’ goals. These scholars have contended that from 1794 to roughly 1830, American inventors were unable to enforce property rights because judges were “antipatent” and routinely invalidated patents for arbitrary reasons. This argument is based partly on examination of court decisions in cases where patent holders (“patentees”) brought suit alleging infringement of their patent rights. In the 1820s, for instance, 75 percent of verdicts were decided against the patentee. The proportion of verdicts for the patentee began to increase in the 1830s, suggesting to these scholars that judicial attitudes toward patent rights began shifting then.  Not all patent disputes in the early nineteenth century were litigated, however, and litigated cases were not drawn randomly from the population of disputes. Therefore, the rate of verdicts in favor of patentees cannot be used by itself to gauge changes in judicial attitudes or enforceability of patent rights. If early judicial decisions were prejudiced against patentees, one might expect that subsequent courts—allegedly more supportive of patent rights—would reject the former legal precedents. But pre-1830 cases have been cited as frequently as later decisions, and they continue to be cited today, suggesting that the early decisions, many of which clearly declared that patent rights were a just recompense for inventive ingenuity, provided a lasting foundation for patent law. The proportion of judicial decisions in favor of patentees began to increase during the 1830s because of a change in the underlying population of cases brought to trial. This change was partly due to an 1836 revision to the patent system: an examination procedure, still in use today, was instituted in which each application is scrutinized for its adherence to patent law. Previously, patents were automatically granted upon payment of a $30 fee.

### Question:
The passage implies that which of the following was a reason that the proportion of verdicts in favor of patentees began to increase in the 1830s?
A: A. Patent applications approved after 1836 were more likely to adhere closely to patent law.
B: B. Patent laws enacted during the 1830s better defined patent rights.
C: C. Judges became less prejudiced against patentees during the 1830s.
D: D. After 1836, litigated cases became less representative of the population of patent disputes.
E: E. The proportion of patent disputes brought to trial began to increase after 1836.

### Response:
<think>
Inference The question asks which statement can be reasonably inferred, from information provided in the passage, to be a reason for the increase in proportion of verdicts favoring patentees, starting in the 1830s. The second paragraph argues that what changed in that decade was not judges’ attitudes toward patent law but the types of patent cases that were litigated. It explains that a law passed in 1836 required that, for the first time in U.S. history, applications for patents had to be examined for their adherence to patent law before a patent would be issued. This information implies that patents granted after 1836 were more likely to adhere to patent law and were thus more likely to be upheld in court.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The passage implies that patents granted after the 1836 law went into effect were more likely to adhere to patent law.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not indicate that any law mentioned made changes to the definition of patent rights; rather, the passage indicates that the patent system was revised to require that patent applications be reviewed for adherence to existing law.
Explanation C: C. The passage rejects the explanation that judges’ attitudes toward patent rights became more favorable.
Explanation D: D. The passage indicates that the population of disputes that were litigated changed after 1836, but it does not suggest that the population of litigated disputes differed from that of patent disputes as a whole.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not indicate any change in the proportion of patent disputes brought to trial.

### Question:
The passage implies that the scholars mentioned in line 8 would agree with which of the following criticisms of the American patent system before 1830?
A: A. Its definition of property rights relating to inventions was too vague to be useful.
B: B. Its criteria for the granting of patents were not clear.
C: C. It made it excessively difficult for inventors to receive patents.
D: D. It led to excessive numbers of patent-infringement suits.
E: E. It failed to encourage national economic growth.

### Response:
<think>
Inference This question asks about a statement implied by the passage. The scholars mentioned in line 8 question whether U.S. patent law achieved its goal. That goal is described in the first sentence of the passage: to encourage America’s economic growth. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the scholars would criticize the pre-1830 patent system for failing to encourage economic growth.
Explanation A: A. The scholars contend that judges rejected patents for arbitrary reasons, not because the definition of property rights was vague.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not indicate that the scholars were critical of the criteria for granting patents.
Explanation C: C. The scholars are concerned with inventors’ attempts to protect their patents, not the difficulty of acquiring a patent in the first place.
Explanation D: D. The passage does not imply that the scholars in question believed that too many patent- infringement suits were brought to court, but rather that too few succeeded.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The scholars doubt that patent law helped to achieve its goal, which was to encourage economic growth.

Previously, patents were automatically granted upon payment of a $30 fee.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that the frequency with which pre-1830 cases have been cited in court decisions is an indication that
A: A. judicial support for patent rights was strongest in the period before 1830
B: B. judicial support for patent rights did not increase after 1830
C: C. courts have returned to judicial standards that prevailed before 1830
D: D. verdicts favoring patentees in patent-infringement suits did not increase after 1830
E: E. judicial bias against patentees persisted after 1830

### Response:
<think>
Inference The question asks what is indicated by the frequency with which pre-1830 cases have been cited in court decisions. The second paragraph rejects some scholars’ claims that judges prior to the 1830s were antipatent, while judges after that time were more accepting of patent rights. The passage supports its critique by pointing out that decisions made by judges before the 1830s have been cited as precedents by later judges just as frequently as post-1830s decisions have been. This implies that later judges’ attitudes toward patent rights were similar to those of pre-1830s judges. Thus, there is no reason to believe judges’ attitudes toward patent rights changed at that time.
Explanation A: A. The passage argues that judicial support for patents did not change in the 1830s.
Explanation B: B. Correct. Pre-1830s court decisions have been cited as frequently as later decisions, suggesting no change in judges’ attitudes.
Explanation C: C. The passage does not indicate that judicial standards changed from, and then returned to, those that prevailed before 1830.
Explanation D: D. Although actual numbers of favorable verdicts are not mentioned, the passage indicates that the proportion of verdicts decided in favor of patentees did, in fact, increase beginning in the 1830s.
Explanation E: E. The passage rejects the notion that judges were biased against patentees either before or after 1830.

Previously, patents were automatically granted upon payment of a $30 fee.

### Question:
It can be inferred from the passage that the author and the scholars referred to in line 21 disagree about which of the following aspects of the patents defended in patent-infringement suits before 1830?
A: A. Whether the patents were granted for inventions that were genuinely useful
B: B. Whether the patents were actually relevant to the growth of the United States economy
C: C. Whether the patents were particularly likely to be annulled by judges
D: D. Whether the patents were routinely invalidated for reasons that were arbitrary
E: E. Whether the patents were vindicated at a significantly lower rate than patents in later suits

### Response:
<think>
Inference The question depends on recognizing differences between two explanations—one favored by the scholars mentioned in line 21, the other favored by the author—for the frequency with which patents were invalidated in U.S. courts prior to 1830. The first paragraph describes the scholars’ view that judges before 1830 were antipatent and rejected patentees’ claims for arbitrary reasons. The author of the passage rejects that view. As an alternate explanation, the author implies in the second paragraph that earlier patents often violated copyright law; this view is supported with reference to an 1836 revision to the patent system which instituted a procedure by which patent applications were inspected to ensure adherence to patent law.
Explanation A: A. The author and the scholars are both focused on protecting inventors’ property rights, not with their inventions’ utility.
Explanation B: B. Although the passage suggests that the scholars thought America’s patent system did not help encourage economic growth, there is no suggestion that either the scholars or the author believes actual patents defended in court were irrelevant to economic growth.
Explanation C: C. Both the scholars and the author believe that patents defended in court prior to 1830 were more likely to be invalidated than were patents in later legal disputes.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The scholars claim that judges before 1830 decided against patentees for arbitrary reasons, but the passage suggests that the patents may have been invalidated because they failed to adhere to patent law.
Explanation E: E. Both the scholars and the author accept that patents were upheld in court less often before 1830 than after.

These scholars have contended that from 1794 to roughly 1830, American inventors were unable to enforce property rights because judges were “antipatent” and routinely invalidated patents for arbitrary reasons. This argument is based partly on examination of court decisions in cases where patent holders (“patentees”) brought suit alleging infringement of their patent rights. In the 1820s, for instance, 75 percent of verdicts were decided against the patentee. The proportion of verdicts for the patentee began to increase in the 1830s, suggesting to these scholars that judicial attitudes toward patent rights began shifting then.  Not all patent disputes in the early nineteenth century were litigated, however, and litigated cases were not drawn randomly from the population of disputes. Therefore, the rate of verdicts in favor of patentees cannot be used by itself to gauge changes in judicial attitudes or enforceability of patent rights. If early judicial decisions were prejudiced against patentees, one might expect that subsequent courts—allegedly more supportive of patent rights—would reject the former legal precedents. But pre-1830 cases have been cited as frequently as later decisions, and they continue to be cited today, suggesting that the early decisions, many of which clearly declared that patent rights were a just recompense for inventive ingenuity, provided a lasting foundation for patent law. The proportion of judicial decisions in favor of patentees began to increase during the 1830s because of a change in the underlying population of cases brought to trial. This change was partly due to an 1836 revision to the patent system: an examination procedure, still in use today, was instituted in which each application is scrutinized for its adherence to patent law. Previously, patents were automatically granted upon payment of a $30 fee.

### Question:
The author of the passage cites which of the following as evidence challenging the argument referred to in lines 14–15?
A: A. The proportion of cases that were decided against patentees in the 1820s
B: B. The total number of patent disputes that were litigated from 1794 to 1830
C: C. The fact that later courts drew upon the legal precedents set in pre-1830 patent cases
D: D. The fact that the proportion of judicial decisions in favor of patentees began to increase during the 1830s
E: E. The constitutional rationale for the 1836 revision of the patent system

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea The question asks what evidence the author brings to bear against the argument referred to in lines 14–15. In the first paragraph, the author summarizes scholars’ arguments to the conclusion that judges’ attitudes toward patent rights shifted in the 1830s, based on the fact that judges earlier had routinely ruled against patentees in lawsuits whereas judges after that time provided more protection for patent rights. In the second paragraph, the author challenges the claim that judges’ attitudes shifted. The author provides evidence that judges after the 1830s cited legal precedents set in pre-1830s cases, suggesting that their views had not changed.
Explanation A: A. The proportion of cases decided against patentees in the 1920s is cited as evidence that supports the scholars’ argument in the first paragraph, not as evidence challenging their views.
Explanation B: B. The total number of disputes litigated is not mentioned in the passage.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The fact that judges after 1830 cited earlier cases as precedents is used as evidence to challenge scholars’ claims that judges’ attitudes shifted around 1830.
Explanation D: D. The change in the proportion of decisions in favor of patentees is a fact that both the scholars and the author of the passage attempt to explain.
Explanation E: E. No constitutional rationale for the 1836 law is mentioned in the passage.

C Main Idea Summary The passage is primarily concerned with surveying various views of the social standing of European women during the Renaissance. The first paragraph discusses Jacob Burckhardt’s view that the Renaissance was a period in which women had equality with men; Joan Kelly’s contrary view that the Renaissance was a period in which women’s status relative both to men and to medieval women was in decline; and a more complex view, held by various feminist scholars, who suggest that Burckhardt and Kelly each drew too heavily on observations of upper-class Italian women. The second paragraph warns of the risks of conflating “women” and “women writers” in studying the status of Renaissance women, but, despite such a caveat regarding Tina Krontiris’s research, praises her contributions to the field. The author sees her as representative of a cautiously optimistic assessment of Renaissance women’s achievements while stressing the social obstacles Renaissance women faced and the caution they exercised when opposing cultural stereotypes."

### Passage:
Jacob Burckhardt’s view that Renaissance European women “stood on a footing of perfect equality” with Renaissance men has been repeatedly cited by feminist scholars as a prelude to their presentation of rich historical evidence of women’s inequality. In striking contrast to Burckhardt, Joan Kelly in her famous 1977 essay, “Did Women Have a Renaissance?” argued that the Renaissance was a period of economic and social decline for women relative both to Renaissance men and to medieval women. Recently, however, a significant trend among feminist scholars has entailed a rejection of both Kelly’s dark vision of the Renaissance and Burckhardt’s rosy one. Many recent works by these scholars stress the ways in which differences among Renaissance women—especially in terms of social status and religion—work to complicate the kinds of generalizations both Burckhardt and Kelly made on the basis of their observations about upper-class Italian women.  The trend is also evident, however, in works focusing on those middle- and upper-class European women whose ability to write gives them disproportionate representation in the historical record. Such women were, simply by virtue of their literacy, members of a tiny minority of the population, so it is risky to take their descriptions of their experiences as typical of “female experience” in any general sense. Tina Krontiris, for example, in her fascinating study of six Renaissance women writers, does tend at times to conflate “women” and “women writers,” assuming that women’s gender, irrespective of other social differences, including literacy, allows us to view women as a homogeneous social group and make that group an object of analysis. Nonetheless, Krontiris makes a significant contribution to the field and is representative of those authors who offer what might be called a cautiously optimistic assessment of Renaissance women’s achievements, although she also stresses the social obstacles Renaissance women faced when they sought to raise their “oppositional voices.” Krontiris is concerned to show women intentionally negotiating some power for themselves (at least in the realm of public discourse) against potentially constraining ideologies, but in her sober and thoughtful concluding remarks, she suggests that such verbal opposition to cultural stereotypes was highly circumscribed; women seldom attacked the basic assumptions in the ideologies that oppressed them.

### Question:
The author of the passage discusses Krontiris primarily to provide an example of a writer who
A: A. is highly critical of the writings of certain Renaissance women
B: B. supports Kelly’s view of women’s status during the Renaissance
C: C. has misinterpreted the works of certain Renaissance women
D: D. has rejected the views of both Burckhardt and Kelly
E: E. has studied Renaissance women in a wide variety of social and religious contexts

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question focuses on the author’s reason for mentioning Krontiris’s work. The passage states that Krontiris, in her discussion of six Renaissance women writers, is an example of scholars who are optimistic about women’s achievements but also suggest that these women faced significant obstacles. She is a writer who, in other words, agrees with neither Kelly’s negative views nor Burckhardt’s positive approach.
Explanation A: A. The passage indicates that Krontiris uses the Renaissance women writers’ works as historical evidence, not that she offered any criticism of the works themselves.
Explanation B: B. Krontiris’s work, according to the author, is cautiously optimistic about women’s achievements during the Renaissance. This contradicts Kelly’s view that the status of women declined during this time.
Explanation C: C. The author suggests that Krontiris may have erred in taking her six subjects as representative of all women during the Renaissance, not that she made any misinterpretations of their actual writing.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The author uses Krontiris as an example of those feminist scholars who have rejected the overgeneralized approaches of both Kelly and Burckhardt.
Explanation E: E. The author makes clear that Krontiris’s study focuses on literate Renaissance women, who constituted a small minority.

### Question:
According to the passage, Krontiris’s work differs from that of the scholars mentioned in line 12 in which of the following ways?
A: A. Krontiris’s work stresses the achievements of Renaissance women rather than the obstacles to their success.
B: B. Krontiris’s work is based on a reinterpretation of the work of earlier scholars.
C: C. Krontiris’s views are at odds with those of both Kelly and Burkhardt.
D: D. Krontiris’s work focuses on the place of women in Renaissance society.
E: E. Krontiris’s views are based exclusively on the study of a privileged group of women.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question asks what the passage directly states about the difference between Krontiris’s work and the feminist scholars mentioned in the first paragraph. The feminist scholars mentioned in the first paragraph explore differences among Renaissance women, particularly their social status and religion, and thus complicate Burckhardt’s and Kelly’s generalizations. Krontiris’s work, on the other hand, focuses on Renaissance women writers, who are a distinctly privileged and small social group.
Explanation A: A. The second paragraph makes clear that Krontiris addresses the obstacles faced by Renaissance women.
Explanation B: B. The passage does not suggest that Krontiris is reinterpreting or drawing on reinterpretations of the work of earlier scholars.
Explanation C: C. The second paragraph shows that Krontiris’s work does complicate both Burckhardt’s and Kelly’s views, but in this, she is in agreement with the feminist scholars mentioned in the first paragraph.
Explanation D: D. Both Krontiris and the feminist scholars mentioned in the first paragraph are concerned with the place of women in Renaissance society.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The feminist scholars mentioned in the first paragraph are concerned with women of different social classes and religions, whereas Krontiris’s work focuses on a limited social group.

### Question:
According to the passage, feminist scholars cite Burckhardt’s view of Renaissance women primarily for which of the following reasons?
A: A. Burckhardt’s view forms the basis for most arguments refuting Kelly’s point of view.
B: B. Burckhardt’s view has been discredited by Kelly.
C: C. Burckhardt’s view is one that many feminist scholars wish to refute.
D: D. Burckhardt’s work provides rich historical evidence of inequality between Renaissance women and men.
E: E. Burckhardt’s work includes historical research supporting the arguments of the feminist scholars.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea This question asks what the passage says explicitly about why feminist scholars reference Burckhardt’s view of Renaissance women. The first paragraph states that Burckhardt’s view is that Renaissance women enjoyed perfect equality with men, and then follows that by noting how feminist scholars have repeatedly cited this view to contrast it with extensive evidence of women’s inequality during the Renaissance.
Explanation A: A. The passage does not indicate that any feminist scholars cite Burckhardt to refute Kelly’s view. It uses Krontiris as an example of scholars who refute Kelly’s point of view to a certain degree, but Krontiris does not use Burckhardt’s view as her basis for doing so; Krontiris argues against Burckhardt as well.
Explanation B: B. According to the first paragraph, Kelly’s work was in certain ways inconsistent with Burckhardt’s view, but that is not a reason why Burckhardt’s view is cited by feminist scholars. Rather, according to the passage, they cite it in order to argue against it.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Many feminist scholars wish to refute Burckhardt’s view that Renaissance women and men were equal.
Explanation D: D. As the first paragraph makes clear, Burckhardt’s work emphasizes equality, not inequality, between Renaissance women and men.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not discuss the historical research on which Burckhardt based his work.

### Question:
It can be inferred that both Burckhardt and Kelly have been criticized by the scholars mentioned in line 12 for which of the following?
A: A. Assuming that women writers of the Renaissance are representative of Renaissance women in general
B: B. Drawing conclusions that are based on the study of an atypical group of women
C: C. Failing to describe clearly the relationship between social status and literacy among Renaissance women
D: D. Failing to acknowledge the role played by Renaissance women in opposing cultural stereotypes
E: E. Failing to acknowledge the ways in which social status affected the creative activities of Renaissance women

### Response:
<think>
Inference Line 12 refers to feminist scholars who have rejected both Kelly’s and Burckhardt’s views of the status of Renaissance women. The next sentence states that the feminist scholars use class and religious differences among Renaissance women to argue against Kelly’s and Burckhardt’s generalizations, which were based on upper-class Italian women.
Explanation A: A. The second paragraph suggests that Krontiris at times conflates Renaissance women writers and women in general, but the passage does not indicate that the feminist scholars believe this of Kelly or Burckhardt.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The feminist scholars mentioned study different types of Renaissance women and so reject Kelly’s and Burckhardt’s conclusions that were based on a group that was not in fact typical.
Explanation C: C. Krontiris, not Kelly and Burckhardt, is the scholar who, according to the passage, fails to address the relationship between literacy and social status.
Explanation D: D. The passage provides no grounds for determining whether Kelly, Burckhardt, or the feminist scholars mentioned in the first paragraph dealt with Renaissance women’s opposition to cultural stereotypes; Krontiris’s work is concerned with this question.
Explanation E: E. The first paragraph suggests that feminist scholars criticized Kelly and Burckhardt for failing to acknowledge the ways in which social status complicates any generalizations that can be made about Renaissance women’s lives, not their creative activities specifically.

### Question:
The author of the passage suggests that Krontiris incorrectly assumes that
A: A. social differences among Renaissance women are less important than the fact that they were women
B: B. literacy among Renaissance women was more prevalent than most scholars today acknowledge
C: C. during the Renaissance, women were able to successfully oppose cultural stereotypes relating to gender
D: D. Renaissance women did not face many difficult social obstacles relating to their gender
E: E. in order to attain power, Renaissance women attacked basic assumptions in the ideologies that oppressed them

### Response:
<think>
Inference The first statement the author makes about Krontiris, in the second paragraph, concerns what the author characterizes as a problem with Krontiris’s work. Krontiris takes the Renaissance women writers she studies as representative of all Renaissance women; the author says that designating women as the most important grouping fails to consider whether other social differences might make for differences in experience.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The author indicates that Krontiris’s error lies in assuming that women’s identity as women trumps social and other differences.
Explanation B: B. The author does not suggest that Krontiris assumes inappropriate literacy levels among Renaissance women, but rather that Krontiris does not give sufficient consideration to the idea that women who could read and write most likely led lives very different from those of women who could not read and write.
Explanation C: C. The author says that Krontiris suggests that there were many cultural stereotypes that women were not able to oppose effectively.
Explanation D: D. Krontiris, according to the author, acknowledges the many social obstacles faced by women on the basis of their gender.
Explanation E: E. According to the author, Krontiris’s concluding remarks suggest that Renaissance women seldom attacked the basic assumptions in the ideologies that oppressed them.

### Question:
The last sentence in the passage serves primarily to
A: A. suggest that Krontiris’s work is not representative of recent trends among feminist scholars
B: B. undermine the argument that literate women of the Renaissance sought to oppose social constraints imposed on them
C: C. show a way in which Krontiris’s work illustrates a “cautiously optimistic” assessment of Renaissance women’s achievements
D: D. summarize Krontiris’s view of the effect of literacy on the lives of upper- and middle-class Renaissance women
E: E. illustrate the way in which Krontiris’s study differs from the studies done by Burckhardt and Kelly

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation The function of the final sentence of the passage is to indicate how Krontiris’s work takes neither a completely positive nor completely negative view of Renaissance women’s experiences—i.e., how her work is representative of those authors who are cautiously optimistic about the achievements of Renaissance women.
Explanation A: A. The passage discusses Krontiris’s work as an example of the trend described in the latter part of the first paragraph and mentioned in the first line of the second paragraph. The last sentence in the passage shows that Krontiris’s work is in fact representative of recent trends among feminist scholars.
Explanation B: B. The last sentence in the passage states that Renaissance women’s opposition to cultural stereotypes was circumscribed, but it also suggests that these women did gain some power for themselves. Thus, the sentence does not serve primarily to undermine the argument that the women sought to oppose social constraints.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Krontiris’s work illustrates the “cautiously optimistic” view by embracing both the idea that Renaissance women could gain a certain amount of power and the idea that the extent of their opposition was limited.
Explanation D: D. The last sentence in the passage summarizes Krontiris’s view, but that view does not, according to the passage, take into account the effect of literacy on the members of a particular social class.
Explanation E: E. The main function of the final sentence of the passage is to take up the idea of the “cautiously optimistic” assessment offered in the penultimate sentence. This does mark a significant departure from both Burckhardt and Kelly, but the distinction between their work and that of other feminist scholars is marked more clearly earlier in the passage.

Nonetheless, Krontiris makes a significant contribution to the field and is representative of those authors who offer what might be called a cautiously optimistic assessment of Renaissance women’s achievements, although she also stresses the social obstacles Renaissance women faced when they sought to raise their “oppositional voices.” Krontiris is concerned to show women intentionally negotiating some power for themselves (at least in the realm of public discourse) against potentially constraining ideologies, but in her sober and thoughtful concluding remarks, she suggests that such verbal opposition to cultural stereotypes was highly circumscribed; women seldom attacked the basic assumptions in the ideologies that oppressed them.

### Question:
The author of the passage implies that the women studied by Krontiris are unusual in which of the following ways?
A: A. They faced obstacles less formidable than those faced by other Renaissance women.
B: B. They have been seen by historians as more interesting than other Renaissance women.
C: C. They were more concerned about recording history accurately than were other Renaissance women.
D: D. Their perceptions are more likely to be accessible to historians than are those of most other Renaissance women.
E: E. Their concerns are likely to be of greater interest to feminist scholars than are the ideas of most other Renaissance women.

### Response:
<think>
Inference The women Krontiris studied are unusual, the author suggests, because they were literate, thus putting them among the minority of Renaissance women. That they could write, however, means that their written reflections are part of the historical record, whereas the direct impressions of experiences had by Renaissance women who could not write about their lives are lost to history.
Explanation A: A. The author implies that the obstacles faced by Krontiris’s subjects may have been different from those faced by other women, not that they were less formidable.
Explanation B: B. The author does not imply that the women studied by Krontiris are seen as more interesting; rather, the author indicates that their work is that which is available for study.
Explanation C: C. The women Krontiris studies were able to record their own history because they, unlike most other Renaissance women, were literate. This does not imply that they were more concerned with recording history accurately.
Explanation D: D. Correct. Because Krontiris’s subjects were literate, they were able to write down, and thus preserve for historians, their perceptions in a way that most other Renaissance women were not.
Explanation E: E. The author does not suggest that feminist scholars in general are more interested in the concerns of middle- and upper-class literate women than they are with women of other classes.

D Main Idea Summary The main idea of the passage is that observations of asteroid collisions and computer simulations of such collisions indicate that most observed asteroids are loose collections of rocks and only small asteroids are individual, solid rocks. The passage begins by describing how, in theory, one could determine the structure of asteroids by observing the rates at which they spin after collisions. The passage then reports that, using this method, scientists have found that most observed asteroids spin in ways that are inconsistent with their being solid rocks. The second paragraph indicates that the conclusions are supported by computer modeling and then presents a causal explanation for the observed phenomena."

Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
When asteroids collide, some collisions cause an asteroid to spin faster; others slow it down. If asteroids are all monoliths—single rocks—undergoing random collisions, a graph of their rotation rates should show a bell-shaped distribution with statistical “tails” of very fast and very slow rotators. If asteroids are rubble piles, however, the tail representing the very fast rotators would be missing, because any loose aggregate spinning faster than once every few hours (depending on the asteroid’s bulk density) would fly apart. Researchers have discovered that all but five observed asteroids obey a strict limit on rate of rotation. The exceptions are all smaller than 200 meters in diameter, with an abrupt cutoff for asteroids larger than that.  The evident conclusion—that asteroids larger than 200 meters across are multicomponent structures or rubble piles—agrees with recent computer modeling of collisions, which also finds a transition at that diameter. A collision can blast a large asteroid to bits, but after the collision, those bits will usually move slower than their mutual escape velocity. Over several hours, gravity will reassemble all but the fastest pieces into a rubble pile. Because collisions among asteroids are relatively frequent, most large bodies have already suffered this fate. Conversely, most small asteroids should be monolithic, because impact fragments easily escape their feeble gravity.

### Question:
The passage implies which of the following about the five asteroids mentioned in line 12?
A: A. Their rotation rates are approximately the same.
B: B. They have undergone approximately the same number of collisions.
C: C. They are monoliths.
D: D. They are composed of fragments that have escaped the gravity of larger asteroids.
E: E. They were detected only recently.

### Response:
<think>
Inference In line 12, five observed asteroids refers to the five asteroids whose rotation rates are exceptions to the strict limit on the rate of rotation found in all other observed asteroids. These five asteroids all have diameters smaller than 200 meters. The passage indicates that if asteroids were all monoliths—that is, single rocks—then their rotation rates would form a bell curve when graphed, but if asteroids were piles of rubble, the tail of the bell curve indicating very fast rotation rates would be missing. Among asteroids larger than 200 meters, this tail is missing, and only the five asteroids described as exceptions have rotation rates falling at the very high end of the bell curve.
Explanation A: A. All that the passage states about the rotation rates of these five asteroids is that they do not obey a strict limit. The passage does not rule out that their rates of rotation are significantly different from one another.
Explanation B: B. According to the passage, frequent collisions occur among asteroids. But the passage does not suggest that asteroids that are of similar sizes, or that have particularly high rotation rates, will be similar in terms of the number of collisions that they have undergone to reach those distinctive states.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The second paragraph states that most small asteroids should be monolithic, and the five observed asteroids are all smaller than 200 meters in diameter.
Explanation D: D. The five asteroids are most likely not composed of fragments because, as the passage states, small asteroids should be monoliths.
Explanation E: E. The passage notes that researchers have observed these five asteroids, along with others, but it does not indicate when these asteroids were originally detected.

### Question:
The discovery of which of the following would call into question the conclusion mentioned in line 16?
A: A. An asteroid 100 meters in diameter rotating at a rate of once per week
B: B. An asteroid 150 meters in diameter rotating at a rate of 20 times per hour
C: C. An asteroid 250 meters in diameter rotating at a rate of once per week
D: D. An asteroid 500 meters in diameter rotating at a rate of once per hour
E: E. An asteroid 1,000 meters in diameter rotating at a rate of once every 24 hours

### Response:
<think>
Application The conclusion that the text in line 16 points to is that asteroids with diameters greater than 200 meters are multicomponent structures or rubble piles. To call that conclusion into question, an observation would have to suggest that asteroids larger than 200 meters across are not such multicomponent structures. According to the first paragraph, rubble piles cannot be fast rotators: spinning faster than once every few hours would make them fly apart.
Explanation A: A. Nothing in the passage suggests that the behavior of an asteroid 100 meters in diameter is relevant to a conclusion about the behavior of asteroids greater than 200 meters in diameter.
Explanation B: B. Nothing in the passage suggests that the behavior of an asteroid 150 meters in diameter would have any effect on a conclusion about the constitution of asteroids with diameters greater than 200 meters.
Explanation C: C. An asteroid 250 meters in diameter rotating at a rate of once per week would be rotating at a slow enough rate to hold together a pile of rubble. Thus, this observation would be entirely consistent with the conclusion about asteroids larger than 200 meters in diameter.
Explanation D: D. Correct. Assuming that an asteroid composed of a pile of rubble is of a great enough density, a rotation rate greater than one revolution every few hours would make it fly apart. So a 500-meter asteroid rotating at a rate of once per hour—that is, faster than the crucial speed—would fly apart if it were not a monolith. The conclusion states that all asteroids larger than 200 meters are multicomponent structures—that is, are not monoliths—so the discovery of a 500-meter asteroid rotating at a rate of once an hour would call into question that conclusion.
Explanation E: E. An asteroid rotating at a rate of once every 24 hours would, regardless of size, be rotating much more slowly than the once every few hours that the passage claims would make a pile of rubble of a sufficient density fly apart. So an asteroid with a diameter of 1,000 meters that rotated once per day could be a pile of rubble and not conflict with the conclusion.

### Question:

A: A. Small asteroids will be few in number.
B: B. Small asteroids will be monoliths.
C: C. Small asteroids will collide with other asteroids very rarely.
D: D. Most small asteroids will have very fast rotation rates.
E: E. Almost no small asteroids will have very slow rotation rates.

### Response:
<think>
Supporting Idea Regarding small asteroids, the second paragraph states that they have feeble gravity. Any fragments from impacts would escape that gravity, and thus, the passage states, the small asteroids should be monolithic.
Explanation A: A. Small asteroids could be few in number, but the passage does not offer such a prediction.
Explanation B: B. Correct. This prediction is offered in the second paragraph, based on the fact that small asteroids do not have strong gravitational attraction. Any impact fragments will easily escape the weak gravitational attraction of the small asteroids.
Explanation C: C. The passage discusses large asteroids collisions in more detail than small-asteroid collisions, but it provides no basis for predicting how often large and small asteroids will, comparatively, be involved in such collisions.
Explanation D: D. The first paragraph indicates that the rotation rates of small asteroids can exceed the upper limit on the rotation rates of large asteroids, but it does not indicate that most small asteroids have rotation rates that exceed this upper limit.
Explanation E: E. The passage only indicates that there are few observed exceptions to the upper limit on rotation rates of large asteroids, and these exceptions are all smaller than 200 meters in diameter; the passage does not indicate that there are few small asteroids that have very slow rotation rates.

Conversely, most small asteroids should be monolithic, because impact fragments easily escape their feeble gravity.

### Question:
The author of the passage mentions “escape velocity” (see line 22) in order to help explain which of the following?
A: A. The tendency for asteroids to become smaller rather than larger over time
B: B. The speed with which impact fragments reassemble when they do not escape an asteroid’s gravitational attraction after a collision
C: C. The frequency with which collisions among asteroids occur
D: D. The rotation rates of asteroids smaller than 200 meters in diameter
E: E. The tendency for large asteroids to persist after collisions

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question asks about the purpose of the author’s use of the phrase escape velocity in the second paragraph. The author is discussing what occurs after an asteroid collision, in which a large asteroid might be blasted to bits. The bits, according to the author, will move slower than their mutual escape velocity—that is, the speed at which they would have to move to get away from each other and not reassemble, under the influence of gravity, into a rubble pile.
Explanation A: A. The author is emphasizing the asteroid bits that do not escape rather than those that do. Asteroids may become smaller over time, but the fact that most bits move slower than their escape velocity would not help to explain this shrinkage.
Explanation B: B. That the bits of asteroid move slower than their escape velocity helps explain why the fragments reassemble, but it does not help explain the speed with which they reassemble.
Explanation C: C. According to the author, asteroid collisions occur frequently, but the escape velocity of the resulting fragments does not help to explain that frequency.
Explanation D: D. The concept of escape velocity may help explain why small asteroids are monoliths, but it has no relevance, at least as far as the passage indicates, to those asteroids’ rotation rates.
Explanation E: E. Correct. After a collision, it is the asteroid fragments’ failure to reach escape velocity that allows the fragments’ gravitational pull to reassemble them into a rubble pile.

E Main Idea Summary The primary purpose of the passage is to discuss the theory underlying attempts to get particles to travel faster than the speed of light by means of quantum tunneling. The passage states that quantum theory implies that there is a small probability that a particle can tunnel through a solid barrier. The time it takes a particle to tunnel through a barrier increases as the thickness of the barrier increases, but only up to a maximum amount of time; beyond that maximum, the amount of time does not vary no matter the thickness of the barrier. This implies that, given a certain thickness, the particle will exceed the speed of light, and this has received some empirical support."

Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Passage:
Most attempts by physicists to send particles faster than the speed of light involve a remarkable phenomenon called quantum tunneling, in which particles travel through solid barriers that appear to be impenetrable. If you throw a ball at a wall, you expect it to bounce back, not to pass straight through it. Yet subatomic particles perform the equivalent feat. Quantum theory says that there is a distinct, albeit small, probability that such a particle will tunnel its way through a barrier; the probability declines exponentially as the thickness of the barrier increases. Though the extreme rapidity of quantum tunneling was noted as early as 1932, not until 1955 was it hypothesized—by Wigner and Eisenbud—that tunneling particles sometimes travel faster than light. Their grounds were calculations that suggested that the time it takes a particle to tunnel through a barrier increases with the thickness of the barrier until tunneling time reaches a maximum; beyond that maximum, tunneling time stays the same regardless of barrier thickness. This would imply that once maximum tunneling time is reached, tunneling speed will increase without limit as barrier thickness increases. Several recent experiments have supported this hypothesis that tunneling particles sometimes reach superluminal speed. According to measurements performed by Raymond Chiao and colleagues, for example, photons can pass through an optical filter at 1.7 times the speed of light.

### Question:
The author of the passage mentions calculations about tunneling time and barrier thickness in order to
A: A. suggest that tunneling time is unrelated to barrier thickness
B: B. explain the evidence by which Wigner and Eisenbud discovered the phenomenon of tunneling
C: C. describe data recently challenged by Raymond Chiao and colleagues
D: D. question why particles engaged in quantum tunneling rarely achieve extremely high speeds
E: E. explain the basis for Wigner and Eisenbud’s hypothesis

### Response:
<think>
Evaluation This question asks why the author discusses calculations about tunneling time and barrier thickness. According to the passage, these calculations provided the grounds for Wigner and Eisenbud’s hypothesis that tunneling particles may travel faster than light.
Explanation A: A. The passage states that tunneling time is related to barrier thickness, up to the point at which tunneling time reaches a maximum.
Explanation B: B. The passage indicates that the phenomenon of tunneling was noted at least as early as 1932. It provides no evidence that Wigner and Eisenbud discovered it.
Explanation C: C. The passage uses Chiao’s work to support the idea that tunneling particles may move faster than light, not challenge it.
Explanation D: D. The author describes calculations about tunneling time and barrier thickness in order to explain that particles engaged in quantum tunneling may in fact achieve extremely high speeds, not to explain the rarity of the phenomenon.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The calculations about tunneling time and barrier thickness supported Wigner and Eisenbud’s hypothesis that quantum tunneling could occur at speeds faster than that of light.

### Question:
The passage implies that if tunneling time reached no maximum in increasing with barrier thickness, then
A: A. tunneling speed would increase with barrier thickness
B: B. tunneling speed would decline with barrier thickness
C: C. tunneling speed would vary with barrier thickness
D: D. tunneling speed would not be expected to increase without limit
E: E. successful tunneling would occur even less frequently than it does

### Response:
<think>
Inference The passage states that because tunneling time reaches a maximum, then tunneling speed must increase as barrier thickness increases. But if tunneling time did not reach such a maximum, then speed need not increase without limit; the particle could have as low a speed in thicker barriers as in thinner ones and take longer to tunnel through a barrier.
Explanation A: A. If tunneling time could not reach a maximum, then speed might increase, decrease, or remain the same as barrier thickness increases.
Explanation B: B. If tunneling time could not reach a maximum, then speed might increase, decrease, or remain the same as barrier thickness increases.
Explanation C: C. Tunneling speed could vary with barrier thickness if tunneling time could not reach a maximum, but there is no basis in the passage on which to conclude that this is definitely so.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The tunneling particle could have as low a speed in thicker barriers as in thinner ones and simply take longer to make its way through a thicker barrier.
Explanation E: E. The passage states that the probability of successful tunneling declines as the thickness of the barrier increases. However, it does not address the issue of whether the differences in probability of successful tunneling are due to the greater time required to go through thicker barriers.

E: E. They made use of photons to study the phenomenon of tunneling. Inference This question asks about the earliest investigators of quantum tunneling.

### Context:
Arts advocate: Few universities require that students who are specializing in science and technology take many art courses. However, real progress in science and technology requires an element of creativity, which the arts foster. Thus, to help science and technology students succeed in their careers, universities should increase the number of art courses required for them.

### Question:
Which of the following would, if true, most strengthen the argument above?
A: A. Universities required more art courses for science and technology students in the past.
B: B. Participation in art courses increases students’ creative thinking in their science and technology courses.
C: C. More students who are interested in art would specialize in science and technology if the number of art courses required for those programs were increased.
D: D. Some of the most prominent scientists began their careers as artists.
E: E. Discussion of science and technology topics in art courses increases creative thinking among students in those courses. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The arts advocate argues that universities should increase the number of art courses required for students specializing in science and technology, with the goal of helping these students succeed in their careers. Few universities require students in these fields to take many art courses.
### Reasoning: 
 What piece of information, if true and added to the argument, would most strengthen it? One of the arts advocate’s premises is that progress in science and technology requires creativity. Another premise is that courses in the arts foster creativity. The conclusion is that universities should, for the sake of promoting career success, require students specializing in science and technology to take more courses in art. Suppose that participation in art courses enriches students’ participation in the science and technology courses: that would be a further reason for universities to require that the students take more art courses.
Explanation A: A. This does not indicate that increasing art offerings now for science and technology students is the most prudent course of action. Universities’ past decision to offer fewer art courses for science and technology students may have resulted from review of data, careful analysis, and prudent policy assumptions. For example, the decision may have been required in order to finance provision of more science and technology courses.
Explanation B: B. Correct. This suggests that participation in art courses increases the value of science and technology courses, an additional piece of information that strengthens the argument.
Explanation C: C. The argument does not suggest that the goal of requiring science and technology students to take more art courses is to persuade more students interested in art to specialize in science and technology. This information is therefore largely irrelevant to the arts advocate’s Reasoning.
Explanation D: D. This information does not address the role art may have played in the scientists’ achievements in science and technology. Several of these scientists may well have been aspiring artists who failed or became disenchanted and discovered that they could better exploit their talents in science and technology.
Explanation E: E. The arts advocate does not advocate that science and technology topics be addressed in art courses. The arts advocate’s Reasoning focuses on the value of art courses in fostering creativity.

You are a GMAT expert specializing in Critical Reasoning. Your task is to analyze the argument presented in the passage and answer the question that follows. Focus on identifying the premises, conclusion, assumptions, and logical fallacies in the argument. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Context:
Ramirez: The film industry claims that pirated DVDs, which are usually cheaper than legitimate DVDs and become available well before a film’s official DVD release date, adversely affect its bottom line. But the industry should note what the spread of piracy indicates: consumers want lower prices and faster DVD releases. Lowering prices of DVDs and releasing them sooner would mitigate piracy’s negative effect on film industry profits.

### Question:
The argument above relies on which of the following assumptions?
A: A. Releasing legitimate DVDs earlier would not cause any reduction in the revenue the film industry receives from the films’ theatrical release.
B: B. Some people who would otherwise purchase pirated DVDs would be willing to purchase legitimate DVDs if they were less expensive and released earlier than they are now.
C: C. The film industry will in the future be able to produce DVDs more cheaply than is currently the case.
D: D. Some current sellers of pirated DVDs would likely discontinue their businesses if legitimate DVDs were released faster and priced lower.
E: E. Current purchasers of pirated DVDs are aware that those DVDs are not authorized by the film industry. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Pirated DVDs of films are released earlier than the film’s official DVD release day. They are also sold more cheaply. These practices cut into the revenue expected from a film’s official DVD sales. According to Ramirez, the prevalence of piracy indicates that consumers want lower prices and earlier releases. Ramirez concludes that if the official DVDs were sold more cheaply and released earlier, the impact of piracy on film industry profits might be reduced.
### Reasoning: 
 What must Ramirez assume for the argument to be logically correct? To evaluate which answer choice the argument relies on assuming, ask yourself about each answer choice, “If this statement were false, then would the argument’s conclusion also have to be false?” If the answer is yes, then the argument must be making that assumption. For example, suppose the statement made in answer choice B were false. That would mean that none of the people who would otherwise purchase pirated DVDs would be willing to purchase legitimate DVDs even if these were released earlier and at a significantly lower price. If that were so, then the measures Ramirez suggests would not mitigate piracy.
Explanation A: A. This does not have to be assumed for Ramirez’s reasoning to be logically good. Earlier release of the official DVDs at a lower price could somewhat reduce revenue from movie theater showings of the films. But if the revenue from official DVDs released earlier and priced lower were greatly boosted through greatly increased official DVD sales, overall revenue for each film could be higher than would be the case with widespread piracy.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If all existing purchasers of pirated film DVDs continued to purchase such DVDs even after implementation of the changes Ramirez advocates, then the changes would not mitigate the destructive consequences of piracy. Thus, Ramirez’s reasoning must assume that the recommended changes would cause at least some former purchasers of pirated DVDs to begin purchasing the official DVDs.
Explanation C: C. This might improve profits provided revenue did not also decline. Ramirez’s argument does not depend on the assumption that the cost of producing DVDs will decline. Ramirez’s reasoning assumes that total sales volume for official DVDs would increase if piracy were reduced.
Explanation D: D. Ideally, this would occur with the change Ramirez recommends, but it does not have to be assumed for Ramirez’s reasoning to be logically sound. For example, the result Ramirez predicts could occur if all existing sellers of pirated DVDs continued to sell them but sold fewer.
Explanation E: E. This is likely true but is not an assumption that Ramirez needs to make for the reasoning to be logically sound. Even if some DVDs sold by DVD sellers were pirated without the sellers being aware of it, e.g., if they purchased them from a fraudulent wholesaler, the fact that the pirated DVDs are sold more cheaply and before the release of the official DVD would reduce the filmmakers’ total revenue.

### Context:
Harunia Province has a relatively dry climate and is attracting a fast-growing population that has put increasing demands on its water supply. The two companies that supply water to the region have struggled to keep up with demand and still remain profitable. Yet now they are asking Harunian authorities to write residential water-use regulations that could reduce their revenues and restrict their future flexibility in supplying water profitably. Which of the following would, if true, most logically help explain why the water-supply

### Question:
companies are asking the authorities to regulate residential water use?
A: A. The companies are planning large water-transportation and irrigation systems that require the approval of neighboring provinces.
B: B. The companies believe regulation is inevitable and that having it in place now will allow better planning and thus future profitability.
C: C. Few, if any, Harunian government officials have investments in the companies or serve on their boards of directors.
D: D. The companies believe that the population is not likely to continue to grow.
E: E. Long-term climate projections suggest that greater rainfall will eventually increase the amount of water available. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Two water-supply companies are asking the authorities in Harunia Province to regulate residential water use, even though regulation could reduce their revenues and restrict their flexibility in supplying water profitably in the future.
### Reasoning: 
 Which piece of information would most help explain why the companies are advocating water-use regulations that would restrict their operations? The companies are already struggling to keep up with demand from a fast-growing population in the region. So why would they advocate regulations that could, at least in the immediate term, reduce their profits and restrict them? Is there any advantage that the companies perceive—an advantage that would outweigh any disadvantages—in getting regulations instituted soon?
Explanation A: A. It is unclear how this information bears on the companies’ request for regulations in Harunia Province, since neighboring provinces seem primarily involved.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The companies presumably must strategically plan their capital investments to cope with increasing water demand in Harunia Province and to receive adequate return on that investment. In that context it seems critically important for the companies to have certainty at the planning stage about future regulatory requirements. Moreover, given possible shortfalls in water supply, the companies would reasonably expect government regulation even if they did not request it.
Explanation C: C. This suggests that, in framing water regulations, Harunian government officials will not be influenced by financial interests, so the companies cannot expect to obtain special favors from the regulatory authorities in the framing of water regulations.
Explanation D: D. If anything, this suggests that the companies could continue to operate without any regulatory regime that might restrict their operations.
Explanation E: E. This would presumably result in a weakening of the case for residential water-use regulation and would also make it easier for the water-supply companies to meet demand.

### Context:
Loss of the Gocha mangrove forests has caused coastal erosion, reducing fish populations and requiring the Gocha Fishing Cooperative (GFC) to partially fund dredging and new shore facilities. However, as part of its subsidiary businesses, the GFC has now invested in a program to replant significant parts of the coast with mangrove trees. Given income from a controlled harvest of wood with continuing replanting, the mangrove regeneration effort makes it more likely that the cooperative will increase its net income. Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument that mangrove replanting

### Question:
will increase the Gocha cooperative’s net income?
A: A. The cost of dredging and shore facilities was shared with the local government.
B: B. The GFC will be able to hire local workers to assist with the mangrove replanting.
C: C. The GFC derives 10 percent of its revenue from salt-production facilities in an area previously cleared of mangroves.
D: D. Mangrove forests tend to increase the commercial fish populations in coastal fishing grounds.
E: E. A controlled harvesting of mangrove wood by the GFC would have little effect on coastal erosion. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A subsidiary business of the Gocha Fishing Cooperative (GFC) has invested in a program to replant significant parts of the coast with mangrove trees.
### Reasoning: 
 What additional information, if true, would most strengthen the argument’s support for the conclusion that the mangrove regeneration effort will increase the GFC’s net income? If the regeneration effort helped the GFC’s fishing operations, this could lead to an increase in GFC’s income.
Explanation A: A. If the local government helped with the cost of dredging and shore facilities, that would help reduce the GFC’s costs, but that is not directly related to the impact of the GFC’s mangrove regeneration effort on GFC’s net income.
Explanation B: B. It is unclear whether hiring local workers to assist with mangrove replanting would be less costly than hiring workers from elsewhere, so it is unclear whether this would help the GFC increase its net income.
Explanation C: C. The information provided does not indicate whether the mangrove regeneration effort will have any effect on its salt-production facilities, or any revenue or profit that it derives from these facilities, so this does not strengthen the argument.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If the mangrove restoration effort helps increase the commercial fish population in coastal fishing grounds, then there is a good chance that the GFC’s income from its fishing operations will increase as a result.
Explanation E: E. The information provided does not indicate what, if any, effect coastal erosion has on GFC’s net income, so the fact that controlled harvesting of mangrove wood would have little effect on coastal erosion does not strengthen the argument.

### Context:
Executives at the Fizzles Beverage Company plan to boost profits in Country X on their range of fruit-flavored drinks by introducing new flavors based on tropical fruits that are little known there. The executives reason that since the fruit drinks of other companies have none of these flavors, Fizzles will not have to compete for customers and thus will be able to sell the drinks at a higher price.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, presents the most serious potential weakness of the plan?
A: A. The new fruit drinks would be priced significantly higher than other Fizzles fruit drinks with more conventional flavors.
B: B. In a telephone survey, at least one of the consumers contacted said that they preferred many of the new flavors to all of the more familiar flavors.
C: C. To build widespread demand for the new flavors, Fizzles would have to launch an advertising campaign to familiarize consumers with them.
D: D. Consumers choosing among fruit-flavored drinks of different brands generally buy on the basis of name recognition and price rather than the specific fruit flavor.
E: E. Few consumers who are loyal to a specific brand of fruit-flavored drinks would willingly switch to another brand that costs more. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Fizzle Beverage Company’s executives plan to offer drinks with tropical fruit flavors that are little known in Country X in the hope that doing so will boost profits in that country. They reason that because their competitors in that country do not offer drinks with these flavors, Fizzle will be able to sell the drinks at a premium price.
### Reasoning: 
 What casts the most doubt on the claim that the executives’ plan will effectively allow them to sell fruit-flavored drinks at a higher price? The executives believe that the lack of a direct competitor to these drinks will allow the company to sell the drinks for a higher price. But any information indicating that something other than the specific fruit flavor of the drink drives sales of fruit-flavored drinks would cast doubt on the plan.
Explanation A: A. We have already been told that the prices will be higher. The question is whether they will be able to sell the drink successfully at these higher prices as a result of the plan.
Explanation B: B. This provides at least some very slight support for the belief that the plan would succeed (if no one at all preferred the new drinks, then the plan would almost certainly fail); however, the question asks for something that would cast doubt on the effectiveness of the plan.
Explanation C: C. When introducing a new product, companies usually have to launch advertising campaigns, and quite frequently such campaigns effectively create demand for the product, so the fact that Fizzles will have to launch an advertising campaign does not cast doubt on the plan.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The plan depends on consumers wanting the drinks because of their unique, unfamiliar flavors, and being willing to pay a higher price for them because of their uniqueness in the market. If price (presumably a lower one) and name recognition, rather than the specific fruit flavor, are what generally drive sales, then it seems unlikely that the executives’ plan will succeed.
Explanation E: E. Nothing in the information provided indicates how many consumers are loyal to any specific brand of fruit-flavored drinks. Perhaps the vast majority of consumers are willing to switch brands. If that is so, then the fact that the very few who are loyal to a specific brand would not be willing to switch would not cast much doubt on the effectiveness of the plan.

### Context:
Economist: In 2015, the average per-person amount paid for goods and services purchased by consumers in Country X was the equivalent of $17,570 in United States dollars, just 30 percent of the corresponding figure of $58,566 for Country Y. Yet in 2015, there was already a substantial middle class in Country X that had discretionary income for middle-class consumer goods such as new vehicles, computers, or major household appliances, while a significant portion of the middle class in Country Y did not have sufficient income to purchase such items. Which of the following, if true, most helps explain the discrepancy in the relationships

### Question:
described by the economist?
A: A. There are many consumer goods, such as household appliances, that are produced in Country X to be sold in the Country Y market.
B: B. The volume of trade between Country X and Country Y is increasing rapidly in both directions.
C: C. The economy of Country Y is recovering from a downturn that affected both Country Y and Country X.
D: D. Country X residents pay much less than their Country Y counterparts for housing, transportation, and child care.
E: E. In Country Y as well as in Country X, there are few assembly-line jobs in factories that pay a middle-class wage. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 An economist points out that even though in 2015 the average per-person amount paid for goods and services in Country X was only 30 percent of the corresponding figure in Country Y, a substantial middle class in Country X had discretionary income for consumer goods, whereas a substantial portion of the middle class in Country Y did not.
### Reasoning: 
 What, if true, would most help explain the discrepancies described by the economist? Information indicating that residents in Country X pay much less for nondiscretionary items than do residents of Country Y would help explain why, even though people in Country Y pay on average three times more for goods and services than people in Country X, Country X has a more substantial middle class capable of buying discretionary goods than does Country Y.
Explanation A: A. That many consumer goods produced in Country X are intended to be sold in Country Y does not help explain why many people in Country Y are not able to afford such goods.
Explanation B: B. An increasing volume of trade between Country X and Country Y—which, for all we know, is perfectly balanced—would not help explain any discrepancies between the two countries.
Explanation C: C. That the economies of both Country X and Country Y suffered a downturn, and Country Y is recovering, could not plausibly explain why many people in Country Y have trouble paying for discretionary goods unless we had the information that Country Y’s recovery was significantly slower than Country X’s. But we do not have that information.
Explanation D: D. Correct. That people in one nation pay far less for nondiscretionary goods than people in another nation would potentially be helpful in explaining how the people in the former nation would more easily be able to afford discretionary goods.
Explanation E: E. If a claim is true of both Country X and Country Y, it would not help explain a discrepancy between the two countries.

### Context:
Neuroscientist: Memory evolved to help animals react appropriately to situations they encounter by drawing on the past experience of similar situations. But this does not require that animals perfectly recall every detail of all their experiences. Instead, to function well, memory should generalize from past experiences that are similar to the current one. The neuroscientist’s statements, if true, most strongly support which of the following

### Question:
conclusions?
A: A. At least some animals perfectly recall every detail of at least some past experiences.
B: B. Perfectly recalling every detail of all their past experiences could help at least some animals react more appropriately than they otherwise would to new situations they encounter.
C: C. Generalizing from past experiences requires clear memories of most if not all the details of those experiences.
D: D. Recalling every detail of all past experiences would be incompatible with any ability to generalize from those experiences.
E: E. Animals can often react more appropriately than they otherwise would to situations they encounter if they draw on generalizations from past experiences of similar situations. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A neuroscientist claims that memory evolved to help animals learn how to react appropriately by generalizing from past experiences but that this does not require animals to remember all details of those experiences.
### Reasoning: 
 What conclusion would the neuroscientist’s theory about memory most strongly support? The neuroscientist asserts that the evolutionary function of memory is to help animals learn to react appropriately by drawing on generalizations from similar experiences they have had. If memory is to serve this function, drawing on generalizations must actually help animals learn to react more appropriately than they otherwise would, even when they do not remember all the details of past experiences.
Explanation A: A. Even if no animal ever recalls all the details of any past experience, animals could still learn through generalizations, as the neuroscientist claims.
Explanation B: B. This statement could be false even if all of what the neuroscientist says is true. Even if it were never helpful for any animal to recall every detail of all its past experiences, animals could still benefit by learning through generalizations.
Explanation C: C. Generalizations from experiences might be made while the experiences are occurring, so that only the generalizations and not the details need to be remembered.
Explanation D: D. The neuroscientist only claims that remembering perfect details is not required for memory to serve its function, not that such perfect recall is incompatible with memory serving its function.
Explanation E: E. Correct. If the evolutionary function of memory is to help animals react more appropriately by drawing on generalizations from past experiences, it follows that animal memories can often successfully serve this function in this manner.

### Context:
In Country X’s last election, the Reform Party beat its main opponent, the Conservative Party, although pollsters, employing in-person interviews shortly before the vote, had projected a Conservative Party victory. Afterward, the pollsters determined that, unlike Conservative Party supporters, Reform Party supporters were less likely to express their party preference during in-person interviews than they were during telephone interviews. Therefore, using only telephone interviews instead would likely result in more accurate projections for the next election.

### Question:
Which of the following statements, if true, would most support the argument in the passage?
A: A. The number of voters in Country X’s next election will be significantly larger than the number of voters in the last election.
B: B. The Conservative Party will win the next election.
C: C. For each person interviewed in telephone polls before the next election, pollsters will be able to reasonably determine the likelihood of that person voting.
D: D. People who expressed no party preference during the in-person interviews shortly before Country X’s last election did not outnumber the people who expressed a preference for the Conservative Party.
E: E. In the next election, pollsters will be able to conduct more in-person interviews than telephone interviews. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Pollsters, using in-person interviews shortly before the last election in Country X, incorrectly predicted that the Conservative Party would win that election, whereas the Reform Party won instead. The pollsters determined that Reform Party supporters, unlike Conservative Party supporters, are less likely to give their party preference in person than in telephone interviews.
### Reasoning: 
 What additional information, if true, would most strengthen the support, in light of the given information, for the prediction that using only telephone interviews would result in more accurate projections in the next election in Country X? Even if in telephone interviews pollsters are more likely to get accurate information about which party a person interviewed supports, the pollsters’ projections may not be accurate if the pollsters are unable to determine whether that person is actually likely to vote. So, information indicating that pollsters will be able to determine the likelihood that a person will vote would strengthen support for the conclusion.
Explanation A: A. If this larger number of voters in the next election is not anticipated by pollsters, then it may affect the accuracy of their predictions. However, the effect would likely be a decrease, rather than an increase, in accuracy. If the pollsters are able to accurately predict voter turnout, then their predictions for the next election could be more accurate. But we have no indication as to whether their turnout predictions will be accurate.
Explanation B: B. If the Conservative Party will win the next election, an underestimate of Reform Party support will be less important for the accuracy of the projection of which party will win.
Explanation C: C. Correct. It would certainly be helpful if the pollsters were able to determine how likely the person they were interviewing would be to vote.
Explanation D: D. This is irrelevant to the argument. The conclusion concerns the relative accuracy of telephone interviews in predicting voting numbers in the next election.
Explanation E: E. If pollsters are able to do more in-person interviews than telephone interviews for the next election, that at least weakly suggests that they might not be able to conduct a sufficient number of telephone interviews to get a representative sample—which would weaken support for the conclusion, not strengthen it.

### Context:
A company that manufactures plastic products from recyclable plastic is, surprisingly, unconcerned that economic conditions may worsen, despite analysts’ belief that consumers would then consider ecofriendly plastic products an expensive luxury. But the company reasons that it will be able to lower its prices because, in a weakened economy, other ecofriendly plastic manufacturers are likely to fail. Demand among manufacturers for recyclable plastics as raw materials would then plummet, creating an oversupply of such materials, making them less expensive for the manufacturer to purchase and thus lowering the company’s costs.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most weakens the company’s reasoning?
A: A. Smaller ecofriendly plastic manufacturers are more likely to fail in a weakened economy than larger ecofriendly manufacturers are.
B: B. Some retailers whose sales include various companies’ ecofriendly plastic products have struggled in recent years despite the overall good economy.
C: C. Consumers would likely soon learn of the oversupply of recyclable plastics and cease recycling them, significantly raising manufacturers’ raw-material costs.
D: D. Retailers, including retailers that cater to consumers seeking certain types of ecofriendly products, may lose some business if economic conditions worsen.
E: E. The plastics used by the company in its products were, after a recent investigation by a regulatory body, declared to be safe for consumers. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A company that manufactures products from recyclable plastics believes that if economic conditions worsen, it will be able to lower its prices. It believes its costs will decline because other ecofriendly plastic manufacturers will fail, thereby reducing the demand for recyclable plastics as raw materials.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most weaken the reasoning? Suppose the company’s costs did not decline and the company consequently could not reduce its prices. Even if demand for recyclable plastics as raw materials weakens in an economic downturn, the company’s costs may nonetheless not decline if for some reason the supply of recyclable plastics also declines. If so, then the company may well not be able to lower its prices and stay profitable.
Explanation A: A. We are not told whether the company in question is a smaller ecofriendly plastic manufacturer or a larger one. Given that, the fact that smaller such companies are more likely to fail than larger ones may strengthen the argument rather than weaken it (assuming the company in question is a larger such company).
Explanation B: B. If some retailers whose sales include various companies’ ecofriendly plastic products have struggled in a healthy economy, they may well struggle even more in a weak economy. This could help drive the company’s competitors out of business, which is what the company argues is likely to happen in an economic downturn. So, rather than weakening the argument, this arguably strengthens it.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Suppose consumers learn of the oversupply of recyclable plastics and stop recycling them as a result; the oversupply may therefore not last long, and indeed a shortage might arise. This would lead not to lower raw-material costs, as the company argues, but to higher raw-material costs.
Explanation D: D. The information that retailers’ lost business might result in a decrease in sales of the competing products does not weaken the argument. A loss of business due to worsening economic conditions is a presupposition of the argument.
Explanation E: E. The fact that the plastics used by the company have been declared safe has probably helped boost demand for the company’s products, and perhaps for the competing products as well, yet an economic downturn could still hurt the company’s competitors. So, this does little to weaken the company’s argument.

### Context:
Researchers asked volunteers to imagine they were running a five-kilometer race against 50 people and then against 500 people, races in each of which the top 10 percent would receive a $1,000 prize. Asked about the effort they would apply in the respective cases, the volunteers indicated, on average, that they would run slower in the race against the greater number of people. A likely explanation of this result is that those of the volunteers who were most comparatively inclined—those who most tended to compare themselves with others in the social environment—determined (perhaps unconsciously) that extreme effort would not be worthwhile in the 500-competitor race. Which of the following would, if known to be true, most help justify the explanation offered

### Question:
above?
A: A. The volunteers who were most comparatively inclined were also those that had the greatest desire to win a $1,000 prize.
B: B. The volunteers who were the least comparatively inclined had no greater desire to win the $1,000 than those who were the most comparatively inclined.
C: C. The volunteers who were most comparatively inclined were likely to indicate that they would run the two races at the same speed.
D: D. The most comparatively inclined volunteers believed that they were significantly less likely to finish in the top 10 percent in the race against 500 than in the race against 50.
E: E. Volunteers were chosen for participation in the study on the basis of answers to various questions designed to measure the degree to which the volunteers were comparatively inclined. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Volunteers were asked how much effort they would expend when running a five-kilometer race against 50 people and how much they would expend in such a race against 500 people, when the prize for each race is $1,000 for finishing in the top 10 percent. The volunteers indicated, on average, that they would run more slowly in the race against 500 people than in the race against 50 people. This result is likely because comparatively inclined volunteers believed that extreme effort would not have been worthwhile in the race against 500 competitors.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most help to justify the explanation proposed above? If comparatively inclined volunteers thought it was at least as likely that they would finish in the top 10 percent in the race against 500 as in the race against 50, the proposed explanation would fail. Thus, it would help justify the explanation if we knew that the comparatively inclined volunteers believed they were less likely to win in the race against 500 than in the race against 50.
Explanation A: A. If one knew that the volunteers who were most comparatively inclined had the greatest desire to win the $1,000, one might actually be more puzzled about why these volunteers said they would expend less effort against the 500 competitors. If they expended less effort, they would probably be less likely to finish in the top 10 percent.
Explanation B: B. If one knew that the volunteers who were more comparatively inclined had no less desire to win a $1,000 prize than those who were least comparatively inclined, one would have at least some reason to think the comparatively inclined volunteers wanted to win the $1,000; this clearly cannot explain why they would not expend as much effort in the 500- competitor race as in the 50-competitor race.
Explanation C: C. The claim that one would run the two races at the same speed contradicts the position expressed on average by the group as a whole (that they would run more slowly against the larger group of contestants). Therefore, if the most comparatively inclined volunteers said that they would run the two races at the same speed, their position would be inconsistent with that of the group as a whole. So, if this answer choice were true, it would weaken, rather than strengthen, the explanation that the views of the most comparatively inclined volunteers account for the fact that the volunteers said, on average, that they would run more slowly against the greater number of contestants.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If the most comparatively inclined volunteers believed they would be far less likely to finish in the top 10 percent in the race against 500 than in the race against 50, then they would likely believe that extreme effort would not be worthwhile in the race with more people. This therefore is likely to be at least part of the explanation.
Explanation E: E. Even if volunteers were chosen on the basis of answers to questions designed to measure how comparatively inclined they were, we are not told whether the volunteers were chosen because of the degree to which they were comparatively inclined.

### Context:
According to a study, after a week of high-altitude living, twenty men had slimmed down  The men, middle-aged residents of low-altitude areas, had been taken to a research station at 2,650 meters (8,694 feet) above sea level. They had unrestricted access to food and were forbidden vigorous exercise, yet they lost an average of 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) during their one-week stay. Clearly, the lower availability of oxygen at higher altitudes, or hypobaric hypoxia, can be said to have caused the weight loss, since __________.

### Question:
Which of the following would, if true, most logically complete the argument?
A: A. a decrease in oxygen intake has been shown to depress appetite
B: B. the men all participated in the same kinds of exercise during their stay
C: C. the foods available to the men had fewer calories than the foods they usually ate
D: D. exercise at higher altitudes is more difficult than exercise at lower altitudes is
E: E. several weeks after returning home, the men still weighed less than they had before the study Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Twenty middle-aged men lived at a high-altitude research station for one week. They had unrestricted access to food but did no vigorous exercise. By the end of their stay, they had lost an average 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) of weight.
### Reasoning: 
 Which additional information, if true, would most help support the claim that lower availability of oxygen at higher altitudes caused the weight loss? The puzzlement arises from the fact that the twenty men had free access to food and did no vigorous exercise. And consuming less of the types of food they would normally eat would have caused weight loss. But suppose one or both of these behaviors had not occurred?
Explanation A: A. Correct. This information helps support the explanatory hypothesis that lower oxygen levels accounted for the weight loss. The men’s intake of oxygen certainly decreased at an altitude of 2,650 meters (8694 feet), since they normally lived in low-altitude areas. Moreover, reduced appetite would provide a mechanism by which weight loss could have occurred.
Explanation B: B. The men were forbidden vigorous exercise, and we can assume that, in a research context, they followed this restriction. Mild exercise would be unlikely to explain the weight loss.
Explanation C: C. This does not support the explanatory hypothesis concerning the role of oxygen reduction in the weight loss.
Explanation D: D. Even if this is generally true, it does not support the hypothesis that lower oxygen levels accounted for the weight loss.
Explanation E: E. This provides no support for the explanatory hypothesis that lower oxygen levels accounted for the weight loss. It might even cast some doubt on the hypothesis, since over a period of several weeks following the study, the men’s weight did not increase with their return to their normal oxygen levels.

### Context:
Editorial: Our city’s public transportation agency is facing a budget shortfall  The fastest growing part of the budget has been employee retirement benefits, which are exceptionally generous. Unless the budget shortfall is resolved, transportation service will be cut, and many transportation employees will lose their jobs. Thus, it would be in the employees’ best interest for their union to accept cuts in retirement benefits.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption the editorial’s argument requires?
A: A. The transportation employees’ union should not accept cuts in retirement benefits if doing so would not be in the employees’ best interest.
B: B. The only feasible way for the agency to resolve the budget shortfall would involve cutting transportation service and eliminating jobs.
C: C. Other things being equal, it is in the transportation employees’ interest to have exceptionally generous retirement benefits.
D: D. Cutting the retirement benefits would help resolve the agency’s budget shortfall.
E: E. The transportation employees’ union will not accept cuts in retirement benefits if doing so will not allow more transportation employees to keep their jobs. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 An editorial indicates that the fastest growing part of a particular city’s public transportation agency’s budget is employee retirement benefits. The agency’s budget has a shortfall. If the shortfall is not resolved, transportation service will be cut, and many of the employees will lose their jobs.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true if we are to accept the editorial’s conclusion, that it is in the employees’ best interest to accept cuts in retirement benefits? If cutting the employees’ retirement benefits would not be sufficient to resolve the budget shortfall, then it may well not be in the employees’ best interest to accept such cuts. The reasons given for accepting the cuts are related to the undesirable consequences of a continued shortfall.
Explanation A: A. The argument is about whether the union’s accepting the cuts is in fact in the employees’ best interest and does not require any assumption about whether employees should accept what is in their best interest.
Explanation B: B. This is incompatible with an assumption made by the argument. The argument assumes that cutting the retirement benefits of the employees would help resolve the budget shortfall.
Explanation C: C. The argument would actually be stronger if it were NOT the case that it is in the employees’ best interest to have exceptionally generous retirement benefits.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If cutting retirement benefits would not help resolve the agency’s budget shortfall, then cutting those benefits would not help the employees avoid job cuts.
Explanation E: E. The argument does not depend on assuming anything regarding what factors would motivate the union’s acceptance.

### Context:
Researchers hope to find clues about the A’mk peoples who lived in the Kaumpta region about one thousand years ago but who left few obvious traces. The researchers plan to hire the few remaining shamans of the modern-day indigenous people in Kaumpta, who are believed to be descended from the A’mk, to lead them to ancestral sites that may be the remains of A’mk buildings or ceremonial spaces. The shamans were taught the location of such sites as part of their traditional training as youths, and their knowledge of traditional Kaumpta customs may help determine the nature of any sites the researchers find.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the success of the plan depends?
A: A. The researchers have reliable evidence that the A’mk of one thousand years ago built important ceremonial spaces.
B: B. The shamans have a reasonably accurate memory of A’mk sites they learned about as youths.
C: C. Kaumpta shamans are generally held in high esteem for their traditional knowledge.
D: D. Modern technologies available to the researchers are likely to be able to find some A’mk sites easily.
E: E. Most or all A’mk sites are likely to be found within the Kaumpta region. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Researchers wish to find sites of an ancient people, the A’mk, who lived in the Kaumpta region one thousand years ago. Indigenous people believed to be descended from the A’mk live in that region today. Their shamans, as youths, were taught about such sites. To discover some of these sites, the researchers plan to hire the shamans.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true for the success of the researchers’ plan to find the sites by relying on the shamans’ assistance? The plan would fail, for example, if there were no such sites in the Kaumpta region. Therefore, the researchers’ plan depends on assuming that Kaumpta have some such sites—but not that most of the sites are there. The plan also requires that the shamans collectively have reasonably accurate recall of what they learned about the sites as youths.
Explanation A: A. The researchers hope to find buildings or ceremonial spaces or both. However, the plan does not require ceremonial spaces to be found or that the researchers have evidence of them.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If the shamans collectively have no “reasonably accurate memory” of what they learned of the location of such sites, then the researchers’ plan is not a useful one and can have no reasonable expectation of success.
Explanation C: C. This is likely to be so if the indigenous group from which they come is still committed to maintaining their traditional knowledge. But the plan does not rely on the shamans being honored among their own people. It must be assumed, of course, that the shamans currently possess “traditional knowledge” and are willing to share it.
Explanation D: D. The researchers’ reliance on the shamans’ assistance suggests that it is not so easy for the researchers to rely entirely on “modern technologies” in this case.
Explanation E: E. The plan can succeed even if this is not correct. What must be assumed is that at least some of the A’mk sites are within the Kaumpta region; it need not be assumed that most or all are.

### Context:
Astronomer: Most stars are born in groups of thousands, each star in a group forming from the same parent cloud of gas. Each cloud has a unique, homogeneous chemical composition. Therefore, whenever two stars have the same chemical composition as each other, they must have originated from the same cloud of gas.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the astronomer’s argument?
A: A. In some groups of stars, not every star originated from the same parent cloud of gas.
B: B. Clouds of gas of similar or identical chemical composition may be remote from each other.
C: C. Whenever a star forms, it inherits the chemical composition of its parent cloud of gas.
D: D. Many stars in vastly different parts of the universe are quite similar in their chemical compositions.
E: E. Astronomers can at least sometimes precisely determine whether a star has the same chemical composition as its parent cloud of gas. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Most stars are born in groups, any one of which forms from a parent gas cloud with a unique, homogenous chemical composition.
### Reasoning: 
 What would be additional evidence that any two stars with the same chemical composition originated from the same gas cloud? The implicit reasoning is that since the chemical composition of each gas cloud is unique and homogenous, any two stars that formed from gas with the same chemical composition must have originated from the same cloud. The astronomer then infers that if two stars have the same composition now, they must have originated from the same cloud. This inference requires the assumption that the composition each star has now depends only on the composition of the cloud in which it originated. Any evidence that supports this assumption will strengthen the argument.
Explanation A: A. Whether or not stars born in different clouds of gas are ever in the same “group” is not clearly relevant to whether or not they ever have the same chemical composition.
Explanation B: B. How remote clouds of similar compositions are from each other is not clearly relevant to whether stars that have the same chemical composition may have formed from different clouds of gas. Also, the suggestion that different gas clouds may have identical compositions conflicts with the astronomer’s premise that the composition of each cloud from which stars form is unique.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If each star’s composition is identical to that of its parent cloud, and each cloud’s composition is unique, then any two stars identical in composition must have formed from the same parent cloud.
Explanation D: D. If anything, this would suggest that stars with the same composition might have formed from different clouds, so it would weaken rather than strengthen the argument.
Explanation E: E. If astronomers could do this, they might be able to obtain additional evidence for or against the position taken in the argument, but the mere fact that they can do this does not, in itself, provide any support for the astronomer’s argument because it tells us nothing about whether two stars with the same chemical composition as one another actually did originate from the same parent cloud of gas.

### Context:
With employer-paid training, workers have the potential to become more productive not only in their present employment but also in any number of jobs with different employers. To increase the productivity of their workforce, many firms are planning to maintain or even increase their investments in worker training. But some training experts object that if a trained worker is hired away by another firm, the employer that paid for the training has merely subsidized a competitor. They note that such hiring has been on the rise in recent years. Which of the following would, if true, contribute most to defeating the training experts’

### Question:
objection to the firms’ strategy?
A: A. Firms that promise opportunities for advancement to their employees get, on average, somewhat larger numbers of job applications from untrained workers than do firms that make no such promise.
B: B. In many industries, employees that take continuing-education courses are more competitive in the job market.
C: C. More and more educational and training institutions are offering reduced tuition fees to firms that subsidize worker training.
D: D. Research shows that workers whose training is wholly or partially subsidized by their employer tend to get at least as much training as do workers who pay for all their own training.
E: E. For most firms that invest in training their employees, the value added by that investment in employees who stay exceeds the value lost through other employees’ leaving to work for other companies. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Many firms pay to train their workers in order to increase their workforces’ productivity. But in recent years, firms have been increasingly hiring away from each other workers who have had such training.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most help address the concern that firms that pay to train workers are thereby subsidizing competitors that hire away those workers? In order for the employer-paid training to be worthwhile for a given firm despite the risk of subsidizing competitors that may hire away the trained workers, that firm has to gain more benefits from the training than it loses by subsidizing such competitors. Any evidence that this is true for most firms would help to address the experts’ concern.
Explanation A: A. A typical firm does not necessarily want larger numbers of applications from unqualified workers. And if hired, those workers can still be hired away by competitors after the firm has paid to train them, just as the experts warned.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that in many industries, companies, rather than investing in employee training, prefer to hire employees who already have specifically relevant training (perhaps funded by other companies). If anything, this slightly supports, rather than defeats, the training experts’ view. No firm has an interest in making its own employees more competitive in the job market unless the firm is likely to benefit from their being so.
Explanation C: C. Even firms that pay reduced tuition fees for worker training may lose the money they pay for those fees and effectively subsidize competitors that hire the trained employees away. So this does not defeat the training experts’ objection.
Explanation D: D. The more highly trained workers—regardless of whether their training was company subsidized or not—would presumably be prime targets for recruitment by competing firms, just as the experts warned. The research finding in question does not help defeat the experts’ objection.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This explicitly indicates that most firms gain more than they lose from the general practice of firms paying to train their workers.

### Context:
In emerging economies in Africa and other regions, large foreign banks that were set up during the colonial era have long played a major economic role. These institutions have tended to confine their business to the wealthier of banks’ potential customers. But development of these countries’ economies requires financing of the small businesses that dominate their manufacturing, farming, and services sectors. So economic growth will be likely to occur if local banks take on this portion of the financial services markets, since __________.

### Question:
Which of the following completions would produce the strongest argument?
A: A. local banks tend not to strive as much as large foreign banks to diversify their investments
B: B. small farming and manufacturing businesses contribute to economic growth if they obtain adequate investment capital
C: C. large foreign banks in emerging economies could, with local employees and appropriate local consultation, profitably expand their business to less wealthy clients
D: D. some small businesses are among the wealthier customers of foreign banks in emerging economies
E: E. local banks in emerging economies tend to be less risk-averse than foreign banks Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Large foreign banks have long played an economic role in emerging economies, but they have typically confined their business to wealthier customers. Economic development in these countries requires the financing of small businesses that dominate their manufacturing, farming, and services sectors.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most help support the claim that growth in emerging economies will likely occur if local banks help finance small businesses in the relevant sectors of these emerging markets? If it were the case that these small businesses would actually be likely to contribute to economic growth, given adequate investment capital, then economic growth would indeed be likely to occur if local banks provided the investment capital.
Explanation A: A. It could be the case that whatever sorts of investments local banks make—diversified or not—economic growth will not tend to occur; for instance, it could be that the businesses they invest in do not use the capital wisely. So, this claim does not help support the conclusion.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If small farming and manufacturing businesses will contribute to economic growth if they obtain adequate investment capital, then we have fairly good reason to think that economic growth is likely to occur if local banks take on the financing of such small businesses (we merely need to also assume that they will provide adequate investment capital when they take on this financing).
Explanation C: C. Even if large foreign banks could profitably expand their businesses to less-wealthy clients, we have been given no reason to think they will. Furthermore, the claim in need of support is that economic growth will occur if local, rather than foreign, banks financially support these small businesses.
Explanation D: D. The claim that economic growth will occur if local banks finance small businesses in certain sectors is not supported by the claim that there are some small businesses supported by foreign banks. If these businesses are already financially supported and yet there is not the sort of economic growth discussed, then that might even suggest that economic growth is unlikely to occur.
Explanation E: E. It could be that, if local banks are less risk-averse than foreign banks, they will invest in risky businesses that fail, which would not tend to support the claim that economic growth will likely result if local banks in emerging counties provide financial support for the relevant sectors.

### Context:
Exporters in Country X are facing lower revenues due to a shortage of the large metal shipping containers in which they send their goods by sea to other countries. Fewer containers arrive in Country X due to reductions in imports. This has meant lost orders, costly delays, and a scramble for alternatives, such as air freight, all of which are costlier. Moreover, the revenues of exporters in Country X will probably continue to decline in the near future. This is because other countries are likely to find it increasingly unprofitable to export their goods to Country X, and because __________.

### Question:
Which of the following would most logically complete the passage?
A: A. production of shipping containers in Country X is growing rapidly as a response to the shortage
B: B. shipping companies are willing to move containers from country to country only when the containers are full
C: C. the cost of shipping alternatives such as air freight is likely to stabilize in the near future
D: D. consumers in Country X are purchasing more products than ever before
E: E. the worldwide demand for goods made in Country X has only recently begun to rise after a long decline Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Exporters in Country X are finding that there is an insufficient number of shipping containers for them to use for their exports, because the number of such containers arriving in Country X has declined because of reduced imports. Also, alternative methods of shipping are relatively costly. Furthermore, other countries will likely find shipping goods to Country X to be less and less profitable.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most support the prediction that Country X’s exporters’ revenues will likely see further declines in revenue in the near future? If the number of shipping containers available to exporters is likely to decrease, then the prediction would have further support. We know that other countries exporting to Country X will find it increasingly unprofitable, so there is reason to believe their exports will decline further—meaning there will be fewer imports into Country X, which means fewer shipping containers arriving in Country X carrying imported goods, unless the shipping containers shipped in the future are less full than when they are shipped now. If shipping companies are willing to move such containers to another country only when the containers are full, then that will not occur.
Explanation A: A. If production of shipping containers in Country X were rapidly increasing, then the reason given for the decline in revenue for exporters in Country X—that there is an insufficient number of shipping containers—would be undermined, and so therefore would be the conclusion.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If shipping companies are unwilling to move containers from country to country unless the containers are full, then, given Country X’s decline in imports, there will likely be fewer shipping containers available to Country X’s exporters, which provides support for the claim that their revenues will likely decline.
Explanation C: C. If the cost of shipping alternatives such as air freight is likely to stabilize, then those alternative methods of shipping might become economically viable, which would undermine rather than support the conclusion.
Explanation D: D. The fact that consumers in Country X are purchasing more goods than ever before does not affect how much revenue is generated by exporting goods from Country X.
Explanation E: E. If there is increased demand for goods from Country X, then the price of such goods might increase sufficiently to make alternative methods of shipping economically viable, which would undermine rather than support the conclusion.

### Context:
Candle Corporation’s television stations are likely to have more income from advertisers than previously. This is because advertisers prefer to reach people in the 18- to 49-year-old age group and the number of people in that group watching Candle television is increasing. Furthermore, among Candle viewers, the percentage of viewers 18 to 49 years old is increasing. Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument that Candle Corporation

### Question:
will receive more income from advertisers?
A: A. Advertisers carefully monitor the demographic characteristics of television audiences and purchase advertising time to reach the audiences they prefer to reach.
B: B. Among people over 49 years old, fewer viewers of Candle stations buy products advertised on television than do viewers of other stations.
C: C. There will be increasingly more advertisements on television that are directed at viewers who are over 49 years old.
D: D. Candle stations plan to show reruns of television shows during hours when other stations run shows for the first time.
E: E. People 18 to 49 years old generally have less disposable income to spend than do people over 49 years old. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Both the number and the percentage of Candle television viewers who are 18 to 49 years old are increasing. Advertisers prefer to reach people in this age group.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence, when combined with the cited facts, would most support the prediction that Candle will receive more income from advertisers? The argument assumes that the increasing number and percentage of Candle viewers in the age group that advertisers prefer to reach will probably encourage advertisers to spend more on advertising with Candle. This assumption could be supported by evidence that the advertisers realize that Candle is getting more viewers in that preferred age range or by evidence that this awareness will influence the advertisers’ purchase of advertising time.
Explanation A: A. Correct. Advertisers monitoring demographics will probably realize that Candle has increasing numbers of viewers in their preferred age range. If they purchase advertising to reach viewers in that age range, then they will probably purchase more advertising time with Candle.
Explanation B: B. This gives advertisers less reason to advertise on Candle to reach viewers over 49 years old. Other things being equal, that makes Candle likely to receive less income from advertisers, not more income.
Explanation C: C. Since the percentage of Candle viewers 18 to 49 years old is growing, the percentage over 49 years old is probably shrinking. This could make advertisers seeking to reach older viewers less inclined to advertise on Candle even as they increase their overall television advertising.
Explanation D: D. Advertisers are not necessarily inclined to purchase more advertising during showings of reruns than during original airings of television shows and may even be inclined to purchase less advertising during such showings.
Explanation E: E. This gives advertisers less incentive to try to reach audiences between 18 and 49 years old and hence less reason to purchase advertising on Candle.

### Context:
A provincial government plans to raise the gasoline tax to give people an incentive to drive less, reducing traffic congestion in the long term. However, skeptics point out that most people in the province live in areas where cars are the only viable transportation to jobs and stores and therefore cannot greatly change their driving habits in response to higher gasoline prices. In light of the skeptics’ objection, which of the following, if true, would most logically support

### Question:
the prediction that the government’s plan will achieve its goal of reducing traffic congestion?
A: A. The revenue from the tax will be used to make public transportation a viable means of transportation to jobs and stores for far more people.
B: B. The tax will encourage many residents to switch to more fuel-efficient cars, reducing air pollution and other problems.
C: C. Because gasoline has been underpriced for decades, the province has many neighborhoods where cars are the only viable means of transportation.
D: D. Most residents who cannot greatly change their driving habits could compensate for high gasoline prices by reducing other expenses.
E: E. Traffic congestion is an especially serious problem for people for whom cars are the only viable means of transportation. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A provincial government plans to raise the gasoline tax in order to reduce traffic congestion by discouraging people from driving. But skeptics point out that most people in the province have no viable form of transportation other than driving.
### Reasoning: 
 What would suggest that raising the gasoline tax will reduce traffic congestion even though most people in the province have no viable form of transportation other than driving? The skeptics point out that since most people in the province have no way to reach jobs or stores except by car, they will not be able to reduce their driving much even if the gasoline tax increases. Any evidence that raising the gasoline tax would reduce traffic congestion despite this obstacle would help to support the plan in light of the skeptics’ objection.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If the tax will fund these public transit improvements, then far more people will have a viable means of transportation other than driving, undermining the basis of the skeptics’ objection.
Explanation B: B. People switching to fuel-efficient cars would not reduce traffic congestion.
Explanation C: C. This essentially only tends to support the skeptics’ objection. Unless the plan somehow helps to alleviate the necessity of driving (by, for example, making alternative transportation available), the information provided gives no reason to suppose that the higher costs would significantly reduce traffic congestion.
Explanation D: D. If residents cannot greatly change their driving habits, then the tax will not reduce traffic congestion.
Explanation E: E. This suggests that many residents in the province could benefit if the plan did reduce traffic congestion, but it does not provide a reason to believe the plan will have that effect.

### Context:
Editorial: The roof of Northtown’s municipal equipment-storage building collapsed under the weight of last week’s heavy snowfall. The building was constructed recently and met local building-safety codes in every particular, except that the nails used for attaching roof supports to the building’s columns were of a smaller size than the codes specify for this purpose. Clearly, this collapse exemplifies how even a single, apparently insignificant departure from safety standards can have severe consequences.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the editorial’s argument?
A: A. The only other buildings to suffer roof collapses from the weight of the snowfall were older buildings constructed according to less exacting standards than those in the codes.
B: B. The amount of snow that accumulated on the roof of the equipment-storage building was greater than the predicted maximum that was used in drawing up the safety codes.
C: C. Because the equipment-storage building was not intended for human occupation, some safety-code provisions that would have applied to an office building did not apply to it.
D: D. The municipality of Northtown itself has the responsibility for ensuring that buildings constructed within its boundaries meet the provisions of the building-safety codes.
E: E. Because the equipment-storage building was used for storing snow-removal equipment, the building was almost completely empty when the roof collapsed. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The roof of a recently constructed building collapsed under heavy snowfall. The only way the building did not meet safety standards was that some nails for the roof supports were smaller than prescribed by the building codes.
### Reasoning: 
 What would make it less likely that the building’s collapse resulted from a single, apparently minor departure from safety standards? The building met safety standards except for the size of the nails. So if the collapse exemplifies how a departure from safety standards can have severe consequences, as the conclusion claims, then the size of the nails had to be responsible for the collapse. Thus, evidence that a factor other than the size of the nails could fully account for the collapse would weaken the argument.
Explanation A: A. This suggests that the snow would not have been heavy enough to collapse the roof if the construction had completely met the safety standards, so it strengthens, rather than weakens, the argument.
Explanation B: B. Correct. This suggests that the snow could have collapsed the roof even if the nails had met the safety standards, thus casting doubt on the assumption that the nails’ inadequacy was responsible for the collapse.
Explanation C: C. The claim that the safety requirements for this building were weaker than some others tends slightly to strengthen, rather than weaken, the hypothesis that the bad consequences resulted partly from a failure to comply. Even if safety-code provisions for an equipment-storage building differ from those for an office building, they may still be adequate to ensure the roof’s stability.
Explanation D: D. The question of who was responsible for ensuring compliance with the safety codes is irrelevant to whether a failure to comply was responsible for the roof’s collapse.
Explanation E: E. This suggests that the alleged consequences of failing to meet safety standards were less severe than they could have been, but it is irrelevant to determining the cause of the collapse.

### Context:
Political theorist: Even with the best spies, area experts, and satellite surveillance, foreign policy assessments can still lack important information. In such circumstances intuitive judgment is vital. A national leader with such judgment can make good decisions about foreign policy even when current information is incomplete, since __________.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most logically completes the argument?
A: A. the central reason for failure in foreign policy decision making is the absence of critical information
B: B. those leaders whose foreign policy decisions have been highly ranked have also been found to have good intuitive judgment
C: C. both intuitive judgment and good information are required for sound decision-making
D: D. good foreign policy decisions often lead to improved methods of gathering information
E: E. intuitive judgment can produce good decisions based on past experience, even when there are important gaps in current information Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 National leaders sometimes must make foreign policy decisions while lacking important information.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most help support the claim that a national leader with intuitive judgment can make good foreign policy decisions without complete information? The word since preceding the blank indicates that the blank should be filled with a premise supporting the statement immediately before the blank. So, an observation that supports the claim that a national leader with intuitive judgment can make good foreign policy decisions without complete information would logically complete the argument.
Explanation A: A. This gives us no reason to suppose that intuitive judgment helps national leaders avoid such failures.
Explanation B: B. This does not specify who ranked the foreign policy decisions, nor how they determined the rankings, so it gives us no reason to accept those rankings. For all we know, the anonymous rankers may have used the dubious rankings they created as the sole evidence for their so-called findings about which leaders have good intuitive judgment.
Explanation C: C. This implies that intuitive judgment alone is inadequate without good information, so it undermines rather than supports the claim that national leaders can make good foreign policy decisions with intuitive judgment while lacking complete information.
Explanation D: D. This gives us no reason to suppose that good foreign policy decisions can be made in the first place by leaders lacking important information.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This suggests that national leaders can make good foreign policy decisions using intuitive judgment based on their past foreign policy experience, even without complete information about the current situations they’re facing.

### Context:
Supply shortages and signs of growing demand are driving cocoa prices upward  Unusually severe weather in cocoa-producing regions—too much rain in Brazil and too little in West Africa—has limited production. Further, Europe and North America recently reported stronger demand for cocoa. In the first quarter, grinding of cocoa beans—the first stage in processing cocoa for chocolate—rose 8.1 percent in Europe and 16 percent in North America. Analysts have concluded that cocoa’s price will continue to rise at least into the near future.

### Question:
Which of the following would, if true, most strengthen the reasoning above?
A: A. Ground cocoa beans can be stored for long periods before they spoil.
B: B. Several European and North American manufacturers that use cocoa have recently improved their processing capacity.
C: C. It takes new cocoa trees five or six years before they start bearing fruit.
D: D. Governments in Europe and North America are likely to change current restrictions on cocoa imports.
E: E. Historically, cocoa production has varied widely from year to year. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 There has been limited production of cocoa beans due to severe weather and also increased demand for cocoa; as a result, cocoa prices have risen.
### Reasoning: 
 What would help support the analysts’ inference that cocoa prices will continue to rise at least into the near future? If the price of cocoa is to continue to rise, then the conditions that have led to the recent increase in price must not be ameliorated. They would be ameliorated if demand for cocoa beans declined, e.g., because price increases made people less likely to want ground cocoa; they would also be ameliorated if supply increased, e.g., because many new cocoa trees were planted and very quickly started bearing fruit. If we had reason to believe that one or more of these ameliorating factors is unlikely to happen, then we have more reason to think that prices might stay high, and possibly even rise further.
Explanation A: A. That ground cocoa beans can be stored for long periods without spoiling does not tell us whether supply and demand conditions will stay stable, improve, or get worse.
Explanation B: B. The fact that these manufacturers have recently improved their processing capacity might help explain why the grinding of cocoa beans has increased recently, but it does not indicate that this increased capacity will be fully utilized. Often, if end-product demand decreases, industrial capacity will become underutilized.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If it takes new cocoa trees several years to start bearing fruit, then it is less likely that supply can quickly be increased, which in turn makes it less likely that supply can quickly meet any increased demand and thereby relieve pricing pressures.
Explanation D: D. These governments may change current restrictions on cocoa imports, but for all we know, they may make them more restrictive rather than less restrictive. If they made them more restrictive, demand might decrease, in which case prices might actually fall.
Explanation E: E. If cocoa production varies from year to year, it could be that next year cocoa production increases, in which case, as long as demand does not increase as well, prices might fall.

### Context:
During the earliest period of industrialization in Britain, steam engines were more expensive to build and operate than either windmills or water mills, the other practicable sources of power for factories. Yet despite their significant cost disadvantage, steam-powered factories were built in large numbers well before technical improvements brought their cost down. Furthermore, they were built even in regions where geographical conditions permitted the construction of wind- and water-powered factories close to major markets. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the proliferation of steam-powered

### Question:
factories during the earliest period of industrialization in Britain?
A: A. In many areas of Britain, there were fewer steam-powered factories than wind- or water- powered factories in the earliest period of industrialization.
B: B. Unlike wind- or water-powered factories, steam-powered factories were fueled with coal, which sometimes had to be transported significant distances from the mine to the site of the factory.
C: C. It was both difficult and expensive to convert a factory from wind power or water power to steam power.
D: D. In the early period of industrialization, many goods sold in towns and cities could not be mass-produced in factories.
E: E. In Britain, the number of sites where a wind- or water-powered factory could be built was insufficient to provide for all of the demand for factory-produced goods at the time. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Although steam engines were more expensive than windmills and water mills in early industrial Britain, many steam-powered factories were built even in regions where the construction of wind- and water-powered factories was geographically feasible.
### Reasoning: 
 Why might steam-powered factories have proliferated despite their cost disadvantage? Early industrialists would have needed some positive reason to choose steam over less expensive power sources for their factories. For example, steam engines might have operated faster or more effectively than windmills or water mills. Or steam engines might have received government subsidies. Or conditions restricting the number or locations of windmills and water mills might have forced industrialists to use steam power instead.
Explanation A: A. This suggests that the steam-powered factories did not initially proliferate as widely as they might have, but it does not explain why they proliferated to the extent that they did.
Explanation B: B. The inconvenience of transporting coal for steam-powered factories would have made those factories less likely to proliferate, not more likely.
Explanation C: C. The difficulty of converting factories to steam power would have made steam-powered factories less likely to proliferate, not more likely.
Explanation D: D. The technological inability to mass-produce popular products in factories would have made factories in general less likely to proliferate, including steam-powered factories.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The inadequate number of sites for wind- and water-powered factories might have encouraged early industrialists to build steam-powered factories instead, since the high demand for factory-produced goods could have made these factories profitable despite their cost disadvantage.

### Context:
Snowmaking machines work by spraying a mist that freezes immediately on contact with cold air. Because the sudden freezing kills bacteria, QuickFreeze is planning to market a wastewater purification system that works on the same principle.

E: E. Places where the winters are cold rarely have a problem of water shortage. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 QuickFreeze is planning to market wastewater purification systems that work by spraying a mist that freezes on contact with cold air. The sudden freezing kills bacteria. Because the system works only at cold temperatures, municipalities using it will still need to maintain a conventional system.
### Reasoning: 
 Which statement provides the strongest grounds for thinking that at least some municipalities will buy the purification system despite the need to maintain a conventional purification system as well? The passage tells us why a municipality using a QuickFreeze wastewater purification system would still need a conventional system. But why would a municipality want the QuickFreeze system in addition to a conventional system? If conventional systems are not fully effective at cold temperatures, the QuickFreeze system would allow municipalities that sometimes experience cold temperatures to purify their wastewater more effectively.
Explanation A: A. This neither weakens nor strengthens the prediction. There is no basis in the passage for determining whether the QuickFreeze system could help remove impurities other than bacteria from wastewater. If it did, the effect of this information would be neutral, because we are already told that the municipalities would be unable to use the QuickFreeze system as a stand-alone purification system. Without further information, the need to remove other impurities would have no effect on the strength of the prediction.
Explanation B: B. The passage states that municipalities using the QuickFreeze system would still need a conventional system. Thus, the old conventional wastewater systems would still need to be replaced with new conventional systems. This answer choice provides no reason to think municipalities would buy the QuickFreeze system.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This statement, if true, would strengthen the prediction, because it provides a valid reason why the QuickFreeze system could be needed alongside conventional ones: it is more effective than the conventional systems in cold weather.
Explanation D: D. Although this claim does undercut one reason for thinking municipalities might not be likely to purchase the QuickFreeze system, it provides little reason to think that they will purchase such a system. Perhaps in times of cold weather, the QuickFreeze system is very expensive to maintain.
Explanation E: E. The issue of whether or not there are water shortages in places where winters are cold is not directly relevant. If conventional wastewater systems are sufficient to purify water in such places, municipalities would not need the QuickFreeze system (as they would still need to maintain a conventional purification system).

### Context:
Plant scientists have used genetic engineering on seeds to produce crop plants that are highly resistant to insect damage. Unfortunately, the seeds themselves are quite expensive, and the plants require more fertilizer and water to grow well than normal ones. Accordingly, for most farmers the savings on pesticides would not compensate for the higher seed costs and the cost of additional fertilizer. However, since consumer demand for grains, fruits, and vegetables grown without the use of pesticides continues to rise, the use of genetically engineered seeds of this kind is likely to become widespread.

### Question:
In the argument given, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first supplies a context for the argument; the second is the argument’s main conclusion.
B: B. The first introduces a development that the argument predicts will have a certain outcome; the second is a state of affairs that, according to the argument, contributes to bringing about that outcome.
C: C. The first presents a development that the argument predicts will have a certain outcome; the second acknowledges a consideration that tends to weigh against that prediction.
D: D. The first provides evidence to support a prediction that the argument seeks to defend; the second is that prediction.
E: E. The first and the second each provide evidence to support the argument’s main conclusion. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Seeds genetically engineered by plant scientists produce crops that are highly resistant to insect damage, and such crops can be grown with less use of pesticides. The seeds would be costly to use, and the savings on pesticides would not be sufficient, in themselves, to increase most farmers’ profitability. Nonetheless, consumer demand for pesticide-free food materials is increasing, so genetically engineered seeds are likely to become widely used.
### Reasoning: 
 What function is served by the statement that plant scientists have used genetic engineering on seeds to produce insect-resistant crop plants? What function is served by the statement that for most farmers the savings on pesticides would not outweigh other associated costs? The first statement describes an innovation— genetically engineered seeds—that allows crops to be grown with little or no use of pesticides. The second statement notes that savings on pesticide use would not outweigh the higher costs of the genetically engineered seeds. The argument’s main conclusion, however, is the prediction, expressed in the second clause of the final sentence of the passage, that use of such genetically engineered seeds will become widespread.
Explanation A: A. The second statement is not the main conclusion. Instead, it is an intermediate conclusion, which is based on the preceding statements. The main conclusion is presented in the final clause of the passage.
Explanation B: B. This correctly characterizes the first statement but not the second. The second statement is not meant to indicate a factor that contributes to the predicted outcome; instead, it indicates a factor that could hypothetically count against the argument’s prediction.
Explanation C: C. Correct. The first boldfaced portion reports a development in agricultural technology. In the final sentence, the argument goes on to predict that an outcome of this development will be the widespread adoption of insect-resistant genetically engineered seeds. The second boldfaced portion acknowledges a financial consideration that would tend to count against that prediction.
Explanation D: D. The first statement does provide partial support for the prediction stated in the argument’s main conclusion. The second statement does not provide any support for the prediction that the argument seeks to defend. That prediction is expressed in the final clause of the passage and is the main conclusion of the argument.
Explanation E: E. The second statement cannot accurately be described as giving evidence to support the prediction stated in the argument’s main conclusion. Instead, it tangentially acknowledges a consideration that could plausibly be thought to count against the conclusion.

Which of the following most logically completes the passage? Leptin, a protein occurring naturally in the blood, appears to regulate how much fat the body carries by speeding up the metabolism and decreasing the appetite when the body has too much fat.

used as a dietary supplement to control fat, since __________.
A: A. the digestive system breaks down proteins before they can enter the bloodstream
B: B. there are pharmaceuticals already available that can contribute to weight loss by speeding up the metabolism
C: C. people with unusually low levels of leptin in their blood tend to have a high percentage of body fat
D: D. the mice that do not naturally produce leptin were from a specially bred strain of mice
E: E. mice whose bodies did produce leptin also lost some of their body fat when given leptin injections Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Leptin, a protein naturally occurring in the bloodstream, speeds up metabolism to induce loss of excessive fat. Mice that lack leptin have more fat than other mice, but they lose fat when given leptin injections. However, leptin cannot be used as a dietary supplement to control fat.
### Reasoning: 
 What would explain the fact that a dietary supplement of leptin will not help to control fat? Leptin injected into the bloodstream—but not leptin taken as a dietary supplement—helps control fat. So, leptin taken as a dietary supplement is either inactivated in the gastrointestinal system or for some other reason fails to enter the bloodstream.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The digestive system breaks down proteins and would therefore break down leptin, which is a protein. This means that leptin given as a dietary supplement would never reach the bloodstream.
Explanation B: B. The question concerns leptin alone, and this new information fails to explain why leptin cannot help control fat if administered as a dietary supplement.
Explanation C: C. It is unsurprising that this would be so, but this information does nothing to explain why leptin consumed as a supplement would fail to control fat.
Explanation D: D. Presumably leptin administered as a dietary supplement was first tested on mice bred to lack leptin. However, the question about leptin does not concern only mice but presumably humans and other mammals.
Explanation E: E. This suggests that boosting existing normal leptin levels with injections can induce further fat loss. However, this has no obvious relevance to the question raised about why dietary supplements of leptin fail to produce fat loss.

C: C. In certain districts, profits made from cattle ranching are more heavily taxed than profits made from any other industry.
D: D. Some of the cattle that are raised on land cleared in the Amazon are killed by wildcats.
E: E. The amount of money required to begin a rubber-tapping operation is twice as high as the amount needed to begin a cattle ranch. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Suncorp is a new corporation with limited funds. It has been clearing large sections of the tropical Amazon forest for ranching, even though rubber- tapping would be more profitable.
### Reasoning: 
 What would explain why Suncorp is clearing sections of the rain forest for ranching, even though rubber tapping would be more profitable? Because Suncorp has limited funds, if rubber tapping has much higher start-up costs, Suncorp might not have enough money to start rubber-tapping operations. If cattle ranching has much lower start-up costs than rubber tapping, Suncorp might be able to afford such an operation.
Explanation A: A. This statement gives a reason why cattle ranching in the Amazon might be more profitable than one might otherwise think it would be. However, we already know from the passage that rubber tapping would be more profitable than cattle ranching. So, this answer choice does not help explain why cattle ranching might be preferable to rubber tapping.
Explanation B: B. The comparison between the profitableness of cattle ranching in tropical climates and in cold-weather climates is irrelevant. The passage only covers cattle ranching in the tropical Amazon forest. This answer choice would at most explain why Suncorp is undertaking cattle ranching in the Amazon rather than in some cold-weather location.
Explanation C: C. This statement makes what needs to be explained harder to understand, for it indicates that cattle ranching in the Amazon might be less profitable than one would otherwise think.
Explanation D: D. Like answer choice C, this statement indicates a disadvantage of cattle ranching in the Amazon. So, it does not explain why cattle ranching would be preferred to some other economic activity.
Explanation E: E. Correct. Because it costs less to begin cattle ranching than it does to begin rubber tapping, Suncorp—which has limited funds—would have a reason to pursue cattle ranching over a potentially more profitable activity.

### Context:
Archaeologists use technology to analyze ancient sites  It is likely that this technology will advance considerably in the near future, allowing archaeologists to gather more information than is currently possible. If they study certain sites now, they risk contaminating or compromising them for future studies. Therefore, in order to maximize the potential for gathering knowledge in the long run, a team of archaeologists plans to delay the examination of a newly excavated site. Which of the following would be most useful to investigate for the purpose of evaluating the

### Question:
plan’s prospects for achieving its goal?
A: A. Whether any of the contents of the site will significantly deteriorate before the anticipated technology is available
B: B. Whether there will continue to be improvements on the relevant technology
C: C. Whether the team can study a site other than the newly excavated site for the time being
D: D. Whether the site was inhabited by a very ancient culture
E: E. Whether the anticipated technology will damage objects under study Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 To avoid prematurely compromising a newly excavated site, an archaeological team plans to postpone examining it until more advanced technology is developed that will let them gather more information from it. Their goal is to maximize the potential for gathering knowledge.
### Reasoning: 
 What would be most helpful to investigate in order to assess how likely it is that delaying examination of the site will maximize the potential for gathering knowledge from it? In order to maximize (or even increase) the potential for gathering knowledge from the site by delaying its examination, the risk of compromising the site by examining it now has to be greater than the risk that the site will be compromised as much or more by delaying the examination. The delay might also increase the risk that the site will never be examined at all —for example, the team might lose its funding while it delays, or changes in local political conditions might prevent the site’s future examination. Investigating any of these risks could be helpful in assessing the likelihood that the team’s plan will achieve its goal.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If any of the site’s contents will significantly deteriorate before the technology becomes available, that could reduce the ability to gather future information from the site even more than examining and compromising the site now would.
Explanation B: B. The passage already tells us that it is likely the technology will advance considerably in the near future. Given this information, further inquiry into whether there will be any ongoing (perhaps minor) improvements is somewhat redundant and probably of minimal value with respect to evaluating the plan’s likelihood of success.
Explanation C: C. Even if the team can study a second site in the meantime, they might maximize the overall potential for gathering knowledge by delaying the examination of either site, both sites, or neither site until more advanced technology is available.
Explanation D: D. The age of the culture that inhabited the site is irrelevant to assessing the risks of delaying the site’s examination until more advanced technology is available.
Explanation E: E. Even if the anticipated technology will damage or destroy the objects under study, it might still maximize the amount of knowledge that can be gathered from those objects. Without any comparison between the damage risk that would be incurred by proceeding with the current technology and the damage risk that would be incurred by waiting, the mere fact that some damage would occur is irrelevant.

E: E. Firms working under the contingency-fee arrangement take in fewer cases per year than do firms working under the hourly rate arrangement. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Law firms of a certain type are increasingly working on a contingency-fee basis, whereby the firm is only paid if the case is won. For the individual cases that are thus taken and won, the payments are generally greater than the total payments would have been if the firms had been paid on an hourly basis. Furthermore, although cases taken on a contingency-fee basis present a significant risk of working for many hours on a case and not being paid, the passage claims that most firms are likely to make more money, on average, than they would if they took their cases on an hourly basis.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most strongly indicate that, despite the risks, the law firms working on a contingency-fee basis are likely to make more money, on average, than they would have otherwise? Our task is to find the statement that would most strongly support this prediction. A primary risk of using contingency fees is that a firm might have so many unsuccessful cases that the average revenue (and profit) is less than it would have been with hourly fees. Anything indicating that the firms might be able to reduce that risk would provide some support for the prediction that they would make more money with contingency fees than with hourly fees.
Explanation A: A. Supposing that the firms mentioned in this option changed from working on an hourly rate basis to working on a contingency-fee basis, we would not have enough information to predict what the results would be. For example, we may have no reason to expect that the firm would accept the same cases that they would have accepted if they were working on an hourly rate basis. As such, patterns of work on cases taken on an hourly rate basis may be irrelevant for determining how much the firms would make if they were to take their cases on a contingency-fee basis.
Explanation B: B. This answer choice indicates that firms taking cases on a contingency-fee basis can work on the cases for years without payment. Rather than supporting the point that firms would make more money if they worked on a contingency-fee basis, the option illustrates an aspect of the risks associated with this payment arrangement.
Explanation C: C. This answer choice does not support the prediction that most firms are likely to make more; it could mean either that they are likely to have greater total revenue or that they are likely to have a greater amount of profit. With regard to gross revenue, the cost of staff time tells us nothing about how much money the firms are likely to take in. With regard to profits, the need to pay employees even for work on unsuccessful cases slightly weakens the prediction: all else being equal, profits would be higher if employees were not paid for work on such cases. However, we are given no information about whether firms might be able to have some alternative arrangement whereby they pay employees only for successful cases, or about whether they would have to pay considerably more with such arrangements.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This answer choice suggests that firms working on a contingency-fee basis would be able to select cases that they would be likely to win and therefore be paid for. Thus, they could mitigate the risk of having too few successful cases to offset the lack of income from the unsuccessful ones. This increases the probability that the firms would be able to bring in more total revenue in the long run with a contingency-fee system than they would if they charged hourly fees. And since we are given no evidence that the ability to select high-win-probability cases would lead to greater costs, this also tends slightly to strengthen the prediction that the firms’ profits would be greater in the long run.
Explanation E: E. Although the difference in numbers of cases described in this option could, given certain possible facts, be relevant to the prediction made by the argument, we have not been given any such facts.

### Context:
Pretzel vendor: The new license fee for operating a pretzel stand outside the art museum is prohibitively expensive. Charging typical prices, I would need to sell an average of 25 pretzels per hour to break even. At my stand outside City Hall, with about as many passers-by as at the art museum, I average only 15 per hour. So I could not break even running a stand outside the art museum, much less turn a profit.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the pretzel vendor’s argument?
A: A. The pretzel vendor does not sell anything other than pretzels.
B: B. People who visit the art museum are more likely to buy pretzels than are people who go to City Hall.
C: C. The license fee for operating a pretzel stand outside City Hall will not increase.
D: D. People who buy pretzels at pretzel stands are more likely to do so during the lunch hour than at other times.
E: E. The city will grant more licenses for pretzel stands outside the art museum than the number it grants for stands outside City Hall. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Because of a new license fee for operating a pretzel stand outside the art museum, a pretzel vendor would have to sell on average 25 pretzels per hour to break even, which is 10 more on average than the vendor sells outside City Hall. But the museum would have no more passers-by than City Hall has. The vendor concludes that a pretzel stand outside the museum would not break even.
### Reasoning: 
 What additional information, if true, would most weaken the support, in light of the given information, for the prediction that the vendor would not break even running a stand outside the art museum? The vendor’s prediction that a pretzel stand outside the art museum would not break even is based on the following considerations: (1) the vendor would have to sell 10 more pretzels on average per hour than the vendor sells outside City Hall, and (2) there are no more passers-by outside the museum than outside City Hall. But what matters is not how many potential customers pass by the art museum. What matters is how many actual customers there will be. If the people who pass by the stand outside the museum are more likely to buy pretzels than the people who pass by the stand at City Hall are, the prediction might fail.
Explanation A: A. This would be more likely to strengthen the argument than weaken it. If the vendor did sell something other than pretzels outside the museum but not outside City Hall, then it is possible that this product would help the vendor at least break even. But this answer choice tells us that the vendor sells only pretzels.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If the people who visit the museum are more likely to buy pretzels than the people who go to City Hall are, then it could be that the vendor will be able to sell 25 pretzels per hour on average. This could be true even if there are not more people outside the art museum than outside City Hall.
Explanation C: C. The vendor’s prediction is only about whether a stand outside the art museum could break even, not about whether the business in the current location would continue to break even. For that prediction, it does not matter whether there will be a fee for a stand outside City Hall.
Explanation D: D. The vendor’s argument does not include or depend on anything about when the pretzels are sold at the stand. So, a claim that more pretzels are sold during the lunch hour than at any other time does not weaken the argument.
Explanation E: E. This claim strengthens the argument instead of weakening it. If there are more pretzel stands outside the art museum than there are outside City Hall, then there would be more competition. That might make it harder to sell even 15 pretzels per hour, let alone 25.

### Context:
Beginning in 1966, all new cars sold in Morodia were required to have safety belts and power steering. Previously, most cars in Morodia were without these features. Safety belts help to prevent injuries in collisions, and power steering helps to avoid collisions in the first place. But even though in 1966 one-seventh of the cars in Morodia were replaced with new cars, the number of car collisions and collision-related injuries did not decline. Which of the following, if true about Morodia, most helps to explain why the number of

### Question:
collisions and collision-related injuries in Morodia failed to decline in 1966?
A: A. Because of a driver-education campaign, most drivers and passengers in cars that did have safety belts used them in 1966.
B: B. Most of the new cars bought in 1966 were bought in the months of January and February.
C: C. In 1965, substantially more than one-seventh of the cars in Morodia were replaced with new cars.
D: D. An excessive reliance on the new safety features led many owners of new cars to drive less cautiously in 1966 than before.
E: E. The seat belts and power steering put into new cars sold in 1966 had to undergo strict quality-control inspections by manufacturers, whether the cars were manufactured in Morodia or not. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Starting in 1966, new cars sold in Morodia were required to have safety belts and power steering. But the numbers of car collisions and collision-related injuries did not decline that year.
### Reasoning: 
 What could explain why the newly required safety features did not reduce the numbers of collisions and collision-related injuries in 1966? The passage says that power steering helps to prevent collisions and that safety belts help to prevent collision-related injuries. Since most Morodian cars previously lacked these features, and one-seventh of them were replaced with new cars in 1966, the proportion of cars with these features must have increased that year. This should have reduced the numbers of collisions and collision-related injuries unless some other factor counteracted the reductions. Evidence of any such countervailing factor would help to explain why the numbers did not decrease.
Explanation A: A. Increased usage of safety belts should have reduced the number of collision-related injuries, so it would not help explain why this number did not decrease.
Explanation B: B. If the new cars bought in 1966 were mostly purchased early in the year, the increased proportion of cars with the newly required safety features should have started more significantly reducing the numbers of collisions and collision-related injuries early in the year, producing greater reductions for the year as a whole.
Explanation C: C. However many cars were replaced in the year before the safety features were required, in 1966 the replacement of one-seventh of all Morodian cars should still have increased the overall proportion of Morodian cars with the safety features and thus reduced the numbers of collisions and collision-related injuries.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If many owners of the cars with the new safety features drove less cautiously, their recklessness could have increased the overall numbers of collisions and collision- related injuries despite any benefits from the safety features.
Explanation E: E. Strict quality-control inspections should have made the safety features more reliable, further reducing the numbers of collisions and collision-related injuries.

### Context:
Manufacturers of mechanical pencils make most of their profit on pencil leads rather than on the pencils themselves. The Write Company, which cannot sell its leads as cheaply as other manufacturers can, plans to alter the design of its mechanical pencil so that it will accept only a newly designed Write Company lead, which will be sold at the same price as the Write Company’s current lead. Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the Write Company’s projection that its

### Question:
plan will lead to an increase in its sales of pencil leads?
A: A. The new Write Company pencil will be introduced at a price higher than the price the Write Company charges for its current model.
B: B. In the foreseeable future, manufacturers of mechanical pencils will probably have to raise the prices they charge for mechanical pencils.
C: C. The newly designed Write Company lead will cost somewhat more to manufacture than the Write Company’s current lead does.
D: D. A rival manufacturer recently announced similar plans to introduce a mechanical pencil that would accept only the leads produced by that manufacturer.
E: E. In extensive test marketing, mechanical-pencil users found the new Write Company pencil markedly superior to other mechanical pencils they had used. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The Write Company makes mechanical pencils and pencil-lead refills. Companies in this type of business make most of their profits from selling the leads, but the Write Company’s leads cost more than leads made by other firms, so the refills are not selling well. The company plans to alter the design of its pencil and leads so that only the company’s leads will fit. The new leads will be sold at the same price as the existing ones. The company projects that its plan will lead to an increase in the sale of its leads.
### Reasoning: 
 Which of the stated pieces of additional information most strongly supports the company’s projection of an increase in sales of leads? Presumably, because of the price difference, users of Write Company pencils are often refilling them with competitors’ cheaper leads instead of Write Company leads. If the number of sales of the company’s redesigned pencil did not drop significantly below the number of sales for its original pencil, a likely consequence would be a significant increase in refill sales for the redesigned pencil, because users would no longer have the option of using competitors’ leads. The pencil would have to be priced competitively and function well.
Explanation A: A. This slightly weakens support for the company’s projection because it suggests that the redesigned pencil might not sell sufficiently well to boost lead sales unless the redesigned pencil is perceived by potential buyers as being worth the higher price.
Explanation B: B. It is not clear whether, if this predicted outcome were to occur, it would help or hinder the Write Company in selling more of its pencil leads. For all we know, the Write Company’s pencil and leads could become less price-competitive compared with those of other firms.
Explanation C: C. Since the new lead will cost the same as the current one, the increased unit cost would, all else being equal, tend to reduce profits unless this reduction were compensated for by increased sales volume. Given that the price to consumers would stay the same, the lower profit per lead does not suggest that consumers would buy more of the leads.
Explanation D: D. This provides too little information to tell what the effect of the competitor’s action might be. For one thing, we have no information about whether the competitor would continue to sell its leads at a lower price than that of Write Company leads. The competitor’s action might create additional competition for the Write Company’s new products, increasing the risk that the Write Company’s plan will fail. On the other hand, the competitor’s pencils would have a similar potential drawback to that of the new Write Company pencils (restriction on the choice of refill leads), so it might tend to reduce the number of consumers who would avoid the new Write Company pencils in favor of the competitor’s product.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This information suggests that sales of the Write Company’s redesigned pencil may increase (or at least will probably not significantly decrease), that many consumers will find the company’s pencils worth the additional expense of refilling them with Write Company leads, and that consequently the company’s plan to increase lead sales will succeed.

### Context:
Enterprise Bank currently requires customers with checking accounts to maintain a minimum balance or pay a monthly fee. Enterprise plans to offer accounts with no monthly fee and no minimum-balance requirement; to cover their projected administrative costs of $3 per account per month, they plan to charge $30 for overdrawing an account. Since each month on average slightly more than 10 percent of Enterprise’s customers overdraw their accounts, bank officials predict the new accounts will generate a profit.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the bank officials’ prediction?
A: A. Some of Enterprise Bank’s current checking account customers are expected to switch to the new accounts once they are offered.
B: B. One-third of Enterprise Bank’s revenues are currently derived from monthly fees tied to checking accounts.
C: C. Many checking account customers who occasionally pay a fee for not maintaining a minimum balance in their account generally maintain a balance well above the minimum.
D: D. Customers whose checking accounts do not have a minimum-balance requirement are more likely than others to overdraw their checking accounts.
E: E. Customers whose checking accounts do not have a minimum-balance requirement are more likely than others to write checks for small amounts. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Enterprise Bank gives customers checking accounts with no monthly fee provided they maintain a certain minimum balance. However, the bank plans to offer accounts with no minimum-balance requirement and no monthly fee. It plans to cover the bank’s $3 per account per month administrative cost by charging a $30 penalty for overdrafts. Only slightly more than 10 percent of customers, on average, overdraw their accounts in a month. The bank officials predict the new accounts will generate a profit.
### Reasoning: 
 What new information, if accurate, would most strongly support the prediction? If about only one customer in ten, on average, currently has an overdraft in a month, and if this trend continues among customers who sign up for the new account, then the proposed $30 penalty per overdraft will cover the $30 cost of maintaining checking accounts for 10 customers per month. Would removing the minimum-balance requirement significantly increase the 10 percent overdraft rate? If so, then significantly more than one in ten customers, on average, would pay a $30 penalty. If this were so, then the new plan would yield a profit, as predicted.
Explanation A: A. “Some” might mean only a few, and this would probably not be sufficient to make the new plan significantly profitable.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that many customers with the current minimum-balance no-monthly-fee account do not maintain the minimum-balance requirement and pay fees instead. However, this information by itself seems to have little bearing on the new plan.
Explanation C: C. Such customers would be likely to overdraw their accounts less frequently. This suggests that if a preponderance of the customers for the proposed new account were such customers, the overdraft rate would decrease, and the proposed new account would be less profitable, or even unprofitable.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This information provides strong support for the bank officials’ prediction. It indicates that the currently roughly 10 percent overdraft rate might increase drastically with the no-minimum-balance account and, on average, cause the imposition of a $30 penalty on significantly more than 10 percent of customers per month. This would make the new account significantly profitable.
Explanation E: E. This suggests that a check written by one of these customers is more likely to be for a small amount and is therefore somewhat less likely to cause an overdraft (unless such customers typically have small checking balances, which we are not told). If there were many such customers for the proposed new account, the overdraft rate might be less than 10 percent; this would indicate that the new account might not turn out to be profitable.

### Context:
Highway official: When resurfacing our concrete bridges, we should use electrically conductive concrete (ECC) rather than standard concrete. In the winter, ECC can be heated by passing an electric current through it, thereby preventing ice buildup. The cost of the electricity needed is substantially lower than the cost of the deicing salt we currently use. Taxpayer: But ECC is vastly more expensive than standard concrete, so your proposal is probably not justifiable on economic grounds. Which of the following, if true, could best be used by the highway official to support the

### Question:
official’s proposal in the face of the taxpayer’s objection?
A: A. The use of deicing salt causes corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete bridge decks and damage to the concrete itself, thereby considerably shortening the useful life of concrete bridges.
B: B. Severe icing conditions can cause power outages and slow down the work of emergency crews trying to get power restored.
C: C. In weather conditions conducive to icing, ice generally forms on the concrete surfaces of bridges well before it forms on parts of the roadway that go over solid ground.
D: D. Aside from its potential use for deicing bridges, ECC might also be an effective means of keeping other concrete structures such as parking garages and airport runways ice free.
E: E. If ECC were to be used for a bridge surface, the electric current would be turned on only at times at which ice was likely to form. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A highway official recommends using electrically conductive concrete (ECC) for resurfacing concrete bridges. This would allow the transmission of an electric current to prevent ice buildup in winter. The highway official supports the proposal by stating that the cost of the electricity used would be substantially lower than the cost of the deicing salt used at present. A taxpayer objects that ECC is much more expensive than standard concrete.
### Reasoning: 
 Which piece of additional information would most logically address the objection of the taxpayer? Consider whether there could be other, indirect or long-term, costs associated with either of the two deicing methods (salt, electricity). For example, would use of ECC involve installation of additional infrastructure to provide electric power to the bridges—and, if so, how would the total costs compare with total existing costs? What are the cost implications of the current use of deicing salt? Any additional information that addresses these questions will be relevant. Note that the taxpayer’s objection primarily concerns the capital cost of ECC bridge surfacing.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The use of deicing salt causes corrosion that considerably shortens the useful life of the bridge. Clearly, replacement of a bridge would involve a large capital expenditure. This is a major reason for reconsidering the use of deicing salt. Of course, absent additional information about total costs of installation and use of each deicing method, it is not a conclusive reason to discontinue using deicing salt.
Explanation B: B. Power outages in severe icing conditions would cause dangerous road-surface conditions on bridges surfaced with ECC, thus requiring a backup method of deicing in such circumstances. This would probably require road maintenance systems to use an auxiliary power backup or deicing salt in rare cases. However, this provides no evidence that the cost of emergency backup measures would exceed the overall savings available with the use of ECC.
Explanation C: C. This is a reason for ensuring that deicing of bridges is given priority over deicing other places, but this prioritization can be done whatever method of deicing is used.
Explanation D: D. The issues raised by the statements of the highway official and the taxpayer concern only the use of ECC for deicing bridges, so the information in this answer choice has no clear or direct relevance to that issue.
Explanation E: E. This most likely offers no relevant additional information, since it is presumably already taken into account in the claim that the cost of electricity for deicing is lower than the cost of deicing salt. So, this merely acknowledges one way to help optimize the costs associated with ECC deicing, but it is not, by itself, a substantial refutation of the taxpayer’s objection.

### Context:
In virtually any industry, technological improvements increase labor productivity, which is the output of goods and services per person-hour worked. In Parland’s industries, labor productivity is significantly higher than it is in Vergia’s industries. Clearly, therefore, Parland’s industries must, on the whole, be further advanced technologically than Vergia’s are.

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Technological improvements in nearly every industry increase labor productivity, which is the output of goods and services per person-hour worked. Because labor productivity is significantly higher in Parland than Vergia, Parland’s industries are, in general, more technologically advanced than Vergia’s.
### Reasoning: 
 To which criticism is the argument most vulnerable? Though one factor, such as technological advancements, may lead to greater labor productivity, it may not be the only such factor, or even a necessary factor, leading to greater labor productivity. Therefore, the mere fact that one region’s labor is more productive than another’s is not sufficient to establish that the former region is more technologically advanced than the latter region is.
Explanation A: A. The conclusion is not merely a paraphrase of the pieces of information provided in its support. Indeed, the problem with the argument is that the conclusion goes too far beyond what the premises merit.
Explanation B: B. The premises of the argument are not inconsistent with one another.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This accurately describes the flaw in the argument because the reasons given in the argument for its conclusion would be good reasons only if there were no other plausible explanations for Parland’s greater labor productivity.
Explanation D: D. The argument does not mention how long Parland has had more productive labor, or when technological improvements would have occurred.
Explanation E: E. Neither of the premises contains anything that presupposes the conclusion to be true. The argument’s two premises are Technological improvements in nearly every industry increase labor productivity and Labor productivity is significantly higher in Parland than Vergia. The argument’s conclusion states Parland’s industries must, on the whole, be further advanced than Vergia’s are. If anything in the premises presupposed that conclusion, the conclusion could not be false if the premises were true. But the conclusion can be false even if both premises are true. Suppose, for instance, that Parland and Vergia engage in different industries and Parland’s industries inherently have greater labor productivity. That might not be because Parland’s industries are more technologically advanced than Vergia’s are, but only because of the nature of the different industries. Yet it can nonetheless be true that technological improvements increase labor productivity.

### Context:

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The ancient Anasazi settlement at Chaco Canyon had massive buildings, for which some of the timber came from mountains 50 miles away.
### Reasoning: 
 What roles do the statement that Chaco Canyon must have been a major Anasazi center and the statement that only a major center would have the organizational power to import timber from 50 miles away play in the argument? The first and third sentences in the passage are both factual observations. Since no further support is provided for either of them, neither can be a conclusion in the argument. The final sentence (i.e., the second boldfaced portion of the argument) is a speculative generalization about major cultural centers. None of the other statements gives us any reason to think this generalization is true, so it cannot be a conclusion in the argument either. However, the third and fourth sentences together imply that Chaco Canyon was a major cultural center, and the first sentence indicates that it was Anasazi. So, together, the first, third, and fourth sentences all support the claim that Chaco Canyon was a major Anasazi cultural center and thus more generally a major Anasazi center, as the second sentence asserts. Therefore, the first, third, and fourth sentences are all premises that jointly support the second sentence (i.e., the first boldfaced portion of the argument) as a conclusion.
Explanation A: A. As explained above in the Reasoning section, the first boldfaced sentence is a conclusion supported by the second boldfaced sentence, not the other way around.
Explanation B: B. Correct. As explained above in the Reasoning section, the first boldfaced sentence is the argument’s only stated conclusion, and thus is its main conclusion, while all the other sentences are premises used to support it; therefore, the second boldfaced sentence (Only a major cultural center . . . 50 miles away) is a premise used to support the conclusion.
Explanation C: C. As explained above in the Reasoning section, the first boldfaced sentence is the argument’s conclusion, not a premise used to support the conclusion.

### Context:
The Maxilux car company’s design for its new luxury model, the Max 100, included a special design for the tires that was intended to complement the model’s image. The winning bid for supplying these tires was submitted by Rubco. Analysts concluded that the bid would only just cover Rubco’s costs on the tires, but Rubco executives claim that winning the bid will actually make a profit for the company.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most strongly justifies the claim made by Rubco’s executives?
A: A. In any Maxilux model, the spare tire is exactly the same make and model as the tires that are mounted on the wheels.
B: B. Rubco holds exclusive contracts to supply Maxilux with the tires for a number of other models made by Maxilux.
C: C. The production facilities for the Max 100 and those for the tires to be supplied by Rubco are located very near each other.
D: D. When people who have purchased a carefully designed luxury automobile need to replace a worn part of it, they almost invariably replace it with a part of exactly the same make and type.
E: E. When Maxilux awarded the tire contract to Rubco, the only criterion on which Rubco’s bid was clearly ahead of its competitors’ bids was price. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Rubco won a bid for supplying tires for the Max 100, a new luxury model by Maxilux. The bid would barely cover the cost of the tires, but Rubco executives claim that winning the bid will be profitable.
### Reasoning: 
 What would support the executives’ claim? Rubco is not expected to make a profit from supplying the tires for the new cars, so we must look for some other way that Rubco could derive a profit as a result of winning the bid. If by winning the bid Rubco created an inevitable market for itself in replacement tires—on which Rubco could earn a profit—then the executives’ claim may be justified.
Explanation A: A. We have already been told that the bid is expected to barely cover the costs of supplying the tires on the new cars, so the analysts mentioned in the passage have presumably already taken into account that there is a spare tire supplied for the Max 100.
Explanation B: B. If winning the bid led Rubco to win more exclusive contracts with Maxilux, that might help support the executives’ claim. But this statement indicates only that Rubco already has several exclusive contracts to supply Maxilux with tires, not that winning the bid has led to, or will lead to, more such contracts, which is what would be needed.
Explanation C: C. As in answer choice A, this is relevant to the costs of supplying the tires for the Max 100, but presumably this was taken into account by the analysts when they concluded that the bid would barely cover Rubco’s costs on the tires.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This indicates that by winning the bid, Rubco has created a way to profit from the contract with Maxilux, specifically, by creating a market for replacement tires.
Explanation E: E. This is likely one of the reasons that Rubco’s bid only just covers Rubco’s costs on the tires; it does nothing to justify the executives’ claims that the bid will lead to a profit for Rubco.

### Context:
Which of the following most logically completes the passage? Most bicycle helmets provide good protection for the top and back of the head but little or no protection for the temple regions on the sides of the head. A study of head injuries resulting from bicycle accidents showed that a large proportion were caused by blows to the temple area. Therefore, if bicycle helmets protected this area, the risk of serious head injury in bicycle

### Question:
accidents would be greatly reduced, especially since ________.
A: A. among the bicyclists included in the study’s sample of head injuries, only a very small proportion had been wearing a helmet at the time of their accident
B: B. even those bicyclists who regularly wear helmets have a poor understanding of the degree and kind of protection that helmets afford
C: C. a helmet that included protection for the temples would have to be somewhat larger and heavier than current helmets
D: D. the bone in the temple area is relatively thin and impacts in that area are thus very likely to cause brain injury
E: E. bicyclists generally land on their arm or shoulder when they fall to the side, which reduces the likelihood of severe impacts on the side of the head Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Bicycle helmets protect the top and back of the head but not the sides or temples. A study found that a large proportion of head injuries caused by biking accidents were caused by blows to the temple area.
### Reasoning: 
 Why would the risk of serious head injury in bicycle accidents be greatly reduced if bicycle helmets protected the temple regions? If for some reason a serious head injury is particularly likely when there is impact to the temple area, then bicycle helmets that protect that area would be apt to reduce the number of serious head injuries from bicycle accidents. One such reason is that the bone in the temple area is relatively thin.
Explanation A: A. This point is irrelevant because it gives us no information about the seriousness or the likelihood of injuries due to impact to the temple area.
Explanation B: B. Whether bicyclists who regularly wear helmets have a good understanding of what protection their helmets afford is not relevant as to whether serious head injuries are particularly likely to occur from impact to the temple area.
Explanation C: C. This point is relevant only to what a helmet that protected the temple area would be like, not to the seriousness of injuries resulting from impact to that area. If anything, this point counts as a reason against the conclusion, not for it. If such helmets are heavier and larger, they may be used less than they otherwise would be. If fewer helmets are used, then improvements to helmet design will have less of an effect in reducing serious head injuries.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This statement provides a reason why the temple area of the rider’s head needs protection: impacts to this area are very likely to cause brain injuries.
Explanation E: E. This is largely irrelevant. Even if it suggests that head injuries do not generally result from bicyclists falling to the side, it does not indicate that such injuries are rare or that there is not great risk of serious injury in those cases in which there is impact to the temple area.

### Context:
Which of the following most logically completes the argument? In a typical year, Innovair’s airplanes are involved in 35 collisions while parked or being towed in airports, with a resulting yearly cost of $1,000,000 for repairs. To reduce the frequency of ground collisions, Innovair will begin giving its ground crews additional training, at an annual cost of $500,000. Although this will cut the number of ground collisions by about half at best, the drop in repair costs can be expected to be much greater,

### Question:
since __________.
A: A. most ground collisions happen when ground crews are rushing to minimize the time a delayed airplane spends on the ground
B: B. a ground collision typically occurs when there are no passengers on the airplane
C: C. the additional training will focus on helping ground crews avoid those kinds of ground collisions that cause the most costly damage
D: D. the $500,000 cost figure for the additional training of ground crews includes the wages that those crews will earn during the time spent in actual training
E: E. most ground collisions have been caused by the least experienced ground-crew members Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 An airline will give its ground crews additional training to reduce the frequency of the collisions its airplanes are involved in while parked or being towed in airports.
### Reasoning: 
 What premise would most logically support the conclusion that the additional training will reduce repair costs from ground collisions much more than it reduces the number of such collisions? The key word since before the blank shows that the argument should be completed with a premise that supports the preceding claim that the drop in repair costs can be expected to be much greater. What statement would support that claim? Note that the annual cost of training, $500,000, is half as much as the yearly cost of the repairs needed as a result of ground collisions, $1,000,000. We are told that the training will cut the number of ground collisions by at most about half, so if the drop in repair costs will be much greater than half, which would need to be the case to make the training worthwhile, what would have to be true of the ground collisions that the training will help the ground crews avoid? Presumably, they would have to be among the higher repair cost collisions, as opposed to the less serious collisions that result in lower repair costs. That is, the collisions that are avoided would have to make up more than half of the repair costs, so they would have to be costlier than average, given that the number of collisions avoided is no more than half. Thus, it would be quite useful to include in the argument a premise providing evidence that the training will help avoid the sorts of ground collisions that lead to above average repair costs.
Explanation A: A. We are given no reason to believe that the additional training would affect how much ground crews rush to minimize delays.
Explanation B: B. The number of passengers is not clearly relevant to the repair costs resulting from a ground collision and in any case would not be affected by additional ground crew training.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If the training especially helps the ground crews avoid those kinds of collisions that cause the most costly damage—that is, damage from ground collisions that has higher repair costs than the average repair costs for damage from ground collisions— then it will probably reduce repair costs by more than half.
Explanation D: D. Whether the cited expense for training includes wages is irrelevant to whether the training will reduce repair costs more than it reduces the number of collisions.
Explanation E: E. This suggests that the additional training may help reduce the number of collisions, not that it will reduce repair costs more than it reduces the number of collisions.

### Context:
Many agriculturally intensive areas of the world are beginning to encounter water scarcity problems. As a result, many farmers in these areas are likely to reduce their output as the water supply they need in order to maintain production shrinks. However, one group of farmers in such a region plans to increase their production by implementing techniques for water conservation. Which of the following, if true, would most strongly support the prediction that the group’s

### Question:
plan will succeed?
A: A. Farmers who can gain a larger share of the food market in their regions will be better positioned to control more water resources.
B: B. Most agricultural practices in areas with water shortages are water-intensive.
C: C. Other regions of the world not facing water shortages are likely to make up for the reduction in agricultural output.
D: D. Demand for agricultural products in the group’s region is not expected to decline.
E: E. More than half the water used for agriculture in the farmers’ region is lost to evaporation or leakage from irrigation channels. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Farmers in many agriculturally intensive regions will probably reduce their output because the regions’ water supplies are dwindling, but one group of farmers in such a region plans to use water conservation techniques to increase their output.
### Reasoning: 
 What would provide evidence that water conservation techniques will help the farmers increase production despite their region’s dwindling water supplies? In order for the water conservation techniques to be effective, they must result in significantly more water becoming available for the farmers to use. Because overall supplies are shrinking, rather than growing, that can only happen if the farmers are currently losing or wasting a great deal of water in ways that could be prevented with water conservation techniques.
Explanation A: A. This suggests an advantage the farmers will gain if their water conservation plan enables them to increase production, but it provides no evidence that the plan actually will enable them to increase production.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that the plan would have to yield quite a lot of conserved water in order for the farmers to increase production, but it offers no evidence that the plan will do so. Thus, it provides some reason to question whether the plan will succeed.
Explanation C: C. Whether regions without water shortages will increase production is not directly relevant to the question of whether a particular measure would lead to increased production in one region that does have a water shortage.
Explanation D: D. This has some slight, indirect relevance to the question of whether the farmers’ plan will succeed: it suggests that if the farmers do manage to increase production, they will continue to have a market for what they produce. However, it does not address the issue of whether they will be able to increase production. Furthermore, even if demand for agricultural products in the group’s region were expected to decline, it could still remain high enough to support the farmers’ increased output from their water conservation plan.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This suggests that the farmers are losing a lot of water in ways that the water conservation techniques might prevent, so it provides evidence that employing some such techniques could enable the farmers to save enough water to increase their output.

### Context:
Hollywood restaurant is replacing some of its standard tables with tall tables and stools  The restaurant already fills every available seat during its operating hours, and the change in seating arrangements will not result in an increase in the restaurant’s seating capacity. Nonetheless, the restaurant’s management expects revenue to increase as a result of the seating change without any concurrent change in menu, prices, or operating hours.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, provides the best reason for the expectation?
A: A. One of the taller tables takes up less floor space than one of the standard tables.
B: B. Diners seated on stools typically do not linger over dinner as long as diners seated at standard tables.
C: C. Since the restaurant will replace only some of its standard tables, it can continue to accommodate customers who do not care for the taller tables.
D: D. Few diners are likely to avoid the restaurant because of the new seating arrangement.
E: E. The standard tables being replaced by tall tables would otherwise have to be replaced with new standard tables at a greater expense. Argument Construction

### Response:

### Situation: 
 Hollywood restaurant is replacing some of its tables with taller tables and stools, and the management expects this will increase revenue, despite the fact that the restaurant already fills all of its available seats and that this change will not increase seating capacity. Furthermore, there will not be any change in menu, prices, or operating hours.
### Reasoning: 
 What would strongly support the management’s expectation? Since the new seating will not increase the restaurant’s seating capacity, the management’s expectations must be based on a belief that the change to taller tables and stools will somehow change diners’ behavior, perhaps by leading them to order more food, or to stay at their tables for a shorter time, thereby allowing the restaurant to serve more diners during its operating hours without increasing seating capacity. If diners seated at tall tables and on tall stools spend less time lingering over their dinners, then they will leave sooner, opening up the tables for more diners. Because the restaurant, before the change, already fills every available seat during its operating hours, it is reasonable to think that it will be able to serve more diners than it currently does, thereby selling more food and thus increasing revenue.
Explanation A: A. This would be relevant if we could infer from it that seating capacity will increase. However, the passage indicates that the new seating arrangement will not result in greater capacity.
Explanation B: B. Correct. Because the restaurant will be able to serve more meals during its operating hours, the restaurant’s revenue can be expected to increase.
Explanation C: C. This may indicate that the restaurant is less likely to alienate customers who do not care for tall tables and stools, but that only supports the claim that the restaurant will not lose customers and therefore lose revenue; it does not indicate that the restaurant will see revenue increase.
Explanation D: D. Again, this merely indicates that there will not be a loss—or much loss—of revenue, not that there will be an increase in revenue.
Explanation E: E. Less expensive tables will decrease the restaurant’s costs, but it will not increase the restaurant’s revenue.

### Context:
A major network news organization experienced a drop in viewership in the week following the airing of a controversial report on the economy. The network also received a very large number of complaints regarding the report. The network, however, maintains that negative reactions to the report had nothing to do with its loss of viewers.

A: A. The other major network news organizations reported similar reductions in viewership during the same week.
B: B. The viewers who registered complaints with the network were regular viewers of the news organization’s programs.
C: C. Major network news organizations publicly attribute drops in viewership to their own reports only when they receive complaints about those reports.
D: D. This was not the first time that this network news organization has aired a controversial report on the economy that has inspired viewers to complain to the network.

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A major network news organization aired a controversial report on the economy, and the following week the network’s viewership declined. The network claims that the loss of viewers was not connected with negative reactions to the report.
### Reasoning: 
 Which statement most strongly supports the network’s position? If other major news networks had similar drops in viewership, it is implausible to think that the controversial report accounted for the other networks’ drops in viewership. On the other hand, it is plausible to suppose that whatever did cause the drop in the viewership experienced by other network news organizations—e.g., holidays, weather, popular non-news programming—also had that effect on the organization that ran the controversial report. This would give some reason to believe that the airing of the report does not account for the organization’s drop in viewership.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The network’s position is that the drop in viewership was not caused by its airing of the controversial report and thus that the drop was caused by something else. This answer choice provides some evidence that there might have been a different cause. If none of the other networks had aired the controversial report, their reductions in viewership were likely due to some other factor; it is implausible to suppose that disapproval of the one network would have caused viewers to avoid all networks. A simultaneous drop in viewership among all the networks would support the hypothesis that a single factor or set of factors caused the drop for all the networks, including the one that aired the report.
Explanation B: B. If anything, this statement tends to undermine the network’s claim, because it suggests that the report offended people who otherwise might have continued to watch the organization’s programming.
Explanation C: C. Since the network did in fact receive complaints about the report, this statement is irrelevant.
Explanation D: D. The fact that the network has received complaints before about controversial reports on the economy that the network’s news organization has aired tells us nothing about whether this recent report caused a subsequent drop in viewership.
Explanation E: E. The fact that viewers turn to network news broadcasts as their primary source of information about the economy tells us nothing about whether viewers might stop watching a particular network news organization’s programs as a result of its airing a controversial report on the economy.

### Context:
Only a reduction of 10 percent in the number of scheduled flights using Greentown’s airport will allow the delays that are so common there to be avoided. Hevelia airstrip, 40 miles away, would, if upgraded and expanded, be an attractive alternative for fully 20 percent of the passengers using Greentown airport. Nevertheless, experts reject the claim that turning Hevelia into a full-service airport would end the chronic delays at Greentown.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most helps to justify the experts’ position?
A: A. Turning Hevelia into a full-service airport would require not only substantial construction at the airport itself but also the construction of new access highways.
B: B. A second largely undeveloped airstrip close to Greentown airport would be a more attractive alternative than Hevelia for many passengers who now use Greentown.
C: C. Hevelia airstrip lies in a relatively undeveloped area but would, if it became a full-service airport, be a magnet for commercial and residential development.
D: D. If an airplane has to wait to land, the extra jet fuel required adds significantly to the airline’s costs.
E: E. Several airlines use Greentown as a regional hub, so that most flights landing at Greentown have many passengers who then take different flights to reach their final destinations. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 To avoid the delays now common at Greentown’s airport, the number of scheduled flights there would need to be reduced by 10 percent. If the nearby Hevelia airstrip were expanded and upgraded, it would be an attractive alternative for 20 percent of Greentown airport’s passengers. Still, experts do not believe that the delays at Greentown would end even if Hevelia were turned into a full-service airport.
### Reasoning: 
 Which statement most supports the experts’ position? If the number of flights at Greentown’s airport did not drop by at least 10 percent, despite the fact that 20 percent of the passengers who currently use Greentown’s airport would find nearby Hevelia airstrip an attractive alternative, then the delays would not be avoided. Airlines generally use certain airports as regional hubs—an airport through which an airline routes most of its traffic—so, even if many passengers would be willing to use Hevelia airstrip, the number of flights at Greentown may not decline significantly, or at all.
Explanation A: A. The experts’ position concerns what would happen to the flight delays at Greentown airport if the Hevelia airstrip were converted into a full-service airport. So, the fact that there are great costs involved in making such a conversion—possibly making it unlikely— has no bearing on the effects such a conversion would have on flight delays at Greentown if it were to be carried out.
Explanation B: B. This statement indicates that the undeveloped airstrip near Greentown might be a better way to alleviate flight delays at Greentown, but it tells us nothing about the effects that converting the Hevelia airstrip to a full-service airport would have were it to be carried out.
Explanation C: C. This in no way explains why converting the Hevelia airstrip into a full-service airport would not alleviate the problem with flight delays at Greentown.
Explanation D: D. This provides a reason to think that reducing the number of flights at Greentown might make the airport more efficient. But that has no bearing on the effect that converting the Hevelia airstrip to a full-service airport might have on flight delays at Greentown.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This statement provides support for the experts’ position because it gives a reason for thinking that the number of scheduled flights at Greentown would not be reduced, even if Hevelia airstrip became an attractive alternative for some 20 percent of Greentown’s passengers.

### Context:
Farmer: Worldwide, just three grain crops—rice, wheat, and corn—account for most human caloric intake. To maintain this level of caloric intake and also keep pace with global population growth, yields per acre from each of these crops will have to increase at least 1.5 percent every year, given that the supply of cultivated land is diminishing. Therefore, the government should increase funding for research into new ways to improve yields.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the farmer’s argument depends?
A: A. It is solely the government’s responsibility to ensure that the amount of rice, wheat, and corn produced worldwide keeps pace with global population growth.
B: B. Increasing government funding for research into new ways to improve the yields per acre of rice, wheat, and corn crops would help to increase total worldwide annual production of food from these crops.
C: C. Increasing the yields per acre of rice, wheat, and corn is more important than increasing the yields per acre of other crops.
D: D. Current levels of funding for research into ways of improving grain crop yields per acre have enabled grain crop yields per acre to increase by more than 1.5 percent per year worldwide.
E: E. In coming decades, rice, wheat, and corn will become a minor part of human caloric intake, unless there is government-funded research to increase their yields per acre. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The farmer states that although the worldwide human population is increasing, the supply of cultivated land is decreasing. We thus need to increase yields for the food crops that account for most of human caloric intake—rice, wheat, and corn—if we are to maintain our existing caloric intake. The increase in yields, according to the farmer, would need to be at least 1.5 percent every year.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true if we are to accept the farmer’s conclusion, that the government should increase funding for research into new ways to improve crop yields, on the basis of the above statements? The farmer uses the above statements as premises of an argument for an increase in government funding for research on crop yields. Supposing that the farmer’s statements are true, we need to find in the available options the statement that, if added to the argument, may allow us to accept the farmer’s conclusion, based on the argument.
Explanation A: A. Whether or not nongovernmental entities such as NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) are responsible for helping to ensure that humans have an adequate amount of food, governments may or may not also have this responsibility.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If government funding of this research does not increase crop yields, then the premises of the argument provide no support for the conclusion that the government should provide such funding. The cogency of the argument thus depends on this statement.
Explanation C: C. Crops in addition to rice, wheat, and corn could also be very important, and perhaps essential for human existence. However, this would not diminish the importance of food crops such as rice, wheat, and corn.
Explanation D: D. This option may suggest that current levels of funding of research into crop yields are sufficient for purposes of our obtaining the necessary crop yields.
Explanation E: E. This option suggests that rice, wheat, and corn may be replaced by other crops, because the other crops have better yields. Because we might thus have a means for increasing crop yields that does not involve an increase in government research funding, this option may actually decrease the support for the conclusion.

### Context:
The air quality board recently informed Coffee Roast, a small coffee roasting firm, of a complaint regarding the smoke from its roaster. Recently enacted air quality regulations require machines roasting more than 10 pounds of coffee to be equipped with expensive smoke-dissipating afterburners.

The only factors mentioned that might give the firm reason to buy an afterburner are the complaint about smoke and the regulations requiring an afterburner. Since the regulations do not apply in this case, the complaint is more likely to have motivated the firm’s decision. Any serious potential consequences the firm might have faced from failure to address the complaint could have provided a good reason to buy and install the afterburner.
Explanation A: A. If this debate had still been ongoing when the firm made its decision, uncertainty about the pending regulations might have justified the decision. But the debate had already been settled before the firm decided to purchase the afterburner, and the regulations clearly did not require one.
Explanation B: B. An unspecified alteration in flavor is not clearly a good reason to use an afterburner— the afterburner might worsen the flavor.
Explanation C: C. The firm’s roaster was already small enough that the regulations did not require it to be replaced, even without an afterburner.
Explanation D: D. This reason relates only to rules regarding afterburners, not to Coffee Roast’s purchase of an afterburner, which was not mandated by regulations. Furthermore, it could be that the air quality regulations recently enacted are among the strictest in any region, which could result in fewer complaints regardless of whether Coffee Roast installs an afterburner.
Explanation E: E. Correct. Since installing an afterburner is a plausible way to address the complaint and prevent future complaints, the firm has plausible reasons to believe this strategy will help it avoid the negative publicity and lost sales it fears. These considerations could have reasonably justified its decision.

### Context:
People who do regular volunteer work tend to live longer, on average, than people who do not. It has been found that “doing good,” a category that certainly includes volunteer work, releases endorphins, the brain’s natural opiates, which induce in people a feeling of well- being. Clearly, there is a connection: Regular releases of endorphins must in some way help to extend people’s lives. Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the force of the evidence given as

### Question:
support for the hypothesis that endorphins promote longevity?
A: A. People who do regular volunteer work are only somewhat more likely than others to characterize the work they do for a living as “doing good.”
B: B. Although extremely high levels of endorphins could be harmful to health, such levels are never reached as a result of the natural release of endorphins.
C: C. There are many people who have done some volunteer work but who do not do such work regularly.
D: D. People tend not to become involved in regular volunteer work unless they are healthy and energetic to begin with.
E: E. Releases of endorphins are responsible for the sense of well-being experienced by many long-distance runners while running. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 People who volunteer regularly live longer on average than people who do not. Doing good work, including volunteer work, releases endorphins, which induce a feeling of well-being.
### Reasoning: 
 What additional findings would suggest that the cited evidence does not indicate that endorphins increase longevity? The argument implicitly assumes that the reason regular volunteers tend to live longer is that volunteering lengthens their lives. It further assumes that no factor that is correlated with volunteering, other than the endorphin release, would plausibly explain how volunteering could have this effect. Findings that cast doubt on either of these assumptions would undermine the connection between the cited evidence and the conclusion that endorphins promote longevity.
Explanation A: A. Volunteering might greatly boost volunteers’ endorphin levels even if the work the volunteers do for a living is no different from other people’s work.
Explanation B: B. Even if unnaturally high endorphin levels could harm health, the levels attainable through volunteer work may promote health.
Explanation C: C. The argument is about an observed correlation in a certain group of people (those who regularly do volunteer work). How many people are outside that group (i.e., do not regularly do volunteer work) is independent of the question of what causes the observed correlation. Even if some people volunteer only occasionally, volunteering regularly may promote longevity by causing regular releases of endorphins.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This suggests that the initially better health of people who choose to volunteer could fully explain the cited correlation between volunteering and longevity.
Explanation E: E. Unless we are also given evidence that long-distance runners tend not to live longer than other people, this does not undermine the purported evidence in the argument. Endorphins might promote longevity in both regular volunteers and long-distance runners.

### Context:
A study compared a sample of Swedish people older than 75 who needed in-home assistance with a similar sample of Israeli people. The people in the two samples received both informal assistance, provided by family and friends, and formal assistance, professionally provided. Although Sweden and Israel have equally well-funded and comprehensive systems for providing formal assistance, the study found that the people in the Swedish sample received more formal assistance, on average, than those in the Israeli sample.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, does most to explain the difference that the study found?
A: A. A companion study found that among children needing special in-home care, the amount of formal assistance they received was roughly the same in Sweden as in Israel.
B: B. More Swedish than Israeli people older than 75 live in rural areas where formal assistance services are sparse or nonexistent.
C: C. Although in both Sweden and Israel much of the funding for formal assistance ultimately comes from the central government, the local structures through which assistance is delivered are different in the two countries.
D: D. In recent decades, the increase in life expectancy of someone who is 75 years old has been greater in Israel than in Sweden.
E: E. In Israel, people older than 75 tend to live with their children, whereas in Sweden people of that age tend to live alone. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A study of elder care in Israel and Sweden found that in Sweden, of the total amount of care that people older than 75 and needing in-home assistance received, the proportion of care that was formal, i.e., provided by professional care personnel, was greater than in Israel. Both Sweden and Israel had equally good systems for providing formal care, and in both countries, the elderly also received informal care, i.e., care provided by friends and family.
### Reasoning: 
 Among the factors given, which would most contribute to explaining the difference the study found between Sweden and Israel with respect to elder care? A good guess would be that there is a difference in some societal factor that affects the difference the study found. For example, perhaps elders in one of the countries regard maintaining independence as a higher priority than elders in the other and consequently try to rely less on friends and family? Perhaps patterns of decline in ability to remain independent are different in the two countries? Or perhaps a greater proportion of elders live alone in one of the countries than in the other?
Explanation A: A. The difference to be explained concerns only elder care, not care of children.
Explanation B: B. The fact that formal elder care is less available in Swedish rural areas than in Israeli rural areas might suggest that there would be a greater reliance on informal care in such areas in Sweden. But this new information throws little light on how the overall proportions of formal and informal care in each country would be affected.
Explanation C: C. This information is not specific enough to help explain the precise difference found in the study. It is reasonable to assume that the study was conducted with sufficient rigor to take account of any relevant structural differences in the delivery of formal elder care.
Explanation D: D. This could suggest either that the greater proportion of informal elder care in Israel contributes to greater life expectancy or that greater life expectancy signals greater fitness during old age that would make it more practical for friends and family to provide informal elder care.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The prevalence in Israel of elders living in family settings—in contrast to Sweden, where elders tend to live alone—offers a plausible explanation of the difference that the study found in the patterns of elder care in Israel and Sweden. It seems reasonable to think that, all things being equal, elders living alone would use formal elder care services more often than elders living with friends or family.

### Context:
Film director: It is true that certain characters and plot twists in my newly released film The Big Heist are similar to characters and plot twists in Thieves, a movie that came out last year. Pointing to these similarities, the film studio that produced Thieves is now accusing me of taking ideas from that film. The accusation is clearly without merit. All production work on The Big Heist was actually completed months before Thieves was released.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest support for the director’s position?
A: A. Before Thieves began production, its script had been circulating for several years among various film studios, including the studio that produced The Big Heist.
B: B. The characters and plot twists that are most similar in the two films have close parallels in many earlier films of the same genre.
C: C. The film studio that produced Thieves seldom produces films in this genre.
D: D. The director of Thieves worked with the director of The Big Heist on several earlier projects.
E: E. Production work on Thieves began before production work on The Big Heist was started. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The director of the film The Big Heist has been accused, by the studio that produced the film Thieves, of taking ideas from the film. The director responds that the accusation lacks merit, since all production work on The Big Heist was completed before Thieves appeared last year in theaters.
### Reasoning: 
 Which of the five statements most strongly supports the director’s position? Crime thrillers, as a film genre, are likely to have stock characters and plot lines that reflect a long tradition. So, it would be no surprise if some of the characters or plot twists in one such film would resemble, to a greater or lesser extent, the characters and plot twists in another. The studio might be correct in identifying such resemblances between The Big Heist and Thieves. But it would not necessarily be correct that characters or plot lines in The Big Heist were derived from Thieves.
Explanation A: A. This undercuts the director’s position, since it provides information that indicates an opportunity for the director to copy ideas from the script for Thieves.
Explanation B: B. Correct. This information strengthens the support for the director’s claim that the studio’s accusation lacks merit. Since both Thieves and The Big Heist fall within a long tradition of crime thriller films, the characters and plot lines in both films reflect that tradition, and so any resemblances do not imply deliberate copying of the ideas in Thieves by the director of The Big Heist.
Explanation C: C. This information seems largely irrelevant to the issue raised and does not strengthen support for the director’s conclusion.
Explanation D: D. This does little to indicate that the director’s conclusion is correct. For example, the then- future director of Thieves might have discussed with the future director of The Big Heist specific ideas about character and plot for a planned crime thriller film.
Explanation E: E. This does not support the director’s claim. For example, it raises the possibility that information about Thieves leaked during the early stages of production—information that could have been exploited in the production of The Big Heist.

### Context:
In Mernia, commercial fossil hunters often sell important fossils they have found, not to universities or museums, but to individual collectors, who pay much better but generally do not allow researchers access to their collections. To increase the number of fossils available for research, some legislators propose requiring all fossils that are found in Mernia to be sold only to universities or museums. Which of the following, if true, most strongly indicates that the legislators’ proposal will fail to

### Question:

A: A. Some fossil hunters in Mernia are not commercial fossil hunters, but rather are amateurs who keep the fossils that they find.
B: B. Most fossils found in Mernia are common types that have little scientific interest.
C: C. Commercial fossil hunters in Mernia currently sell some of the fossils they find to universities and museums.
D: D. Many universities in Mernia do not engage in fossil research.
E: E. Most fossils are found by commercial fossil hunters, and they would give up looking for fossils if they were no longer allowed to sell to individual collectors. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Fossil hunters in Mernia often sell important fossils to collectors who do not make them accessible to researchers. To increase the number of fossils available for research, some legislators propose requiring all fossils found in Mernia to be sold only to universities or museums.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most strongly suggest that requiring all fossils found in Mernia to be sold only to universities or museums would not increase the number of fossils available for research? To increase the number of fossils available for research, the proposed requirement will have to be implemented and effectively enforced. It will presumably have to increase the total number of fossils sold to universities and museums. And those institutions will have to make more of the fossils in their collections available to researchers than the private collectors do. Evidence that any of those conditions will not be fulfilled would suggest that the legislators’ proposal will fail to achieve its goal.
Explanation A: A. Even if the legislation does not affect fossils kept by amateurs, it might still result in many more fossils being sold to universities or museums rather than to private collectors, and thus might still increase the number of fossils available for research.
Explanation B: B. Even if few Mernian fossils are interesting to researchers, the legislation could still achieve its goal of making more fossils available for research.
Explanation C: C. Even if commercial fossil hunters already sell a few fossils to universities and museums, the legislation could encourage them to sell many more fossils.
Explanation D: D. The universities that do not engage in fossil research presumably will not be interested in buying fossils even if the legislation passes. But the fossil hunters can just sell their fossils to other universities and museums that do engage in fossil research.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This suggests that if the legislation passes, fossils will simply be left in the ground rather than sold to private collectors. That would not increase the total number of fossils available for research.

### Context:
Economist: Tropicorp, which constantly seeks profitable investment opportunities, has been buying and clearing sections of tropical forest for cattle ranching, although pastures newly created there become useless for grazing after just a few years. The company has not gone into rubber tapping, even though greater profits can be made from rubber tapping, which leaves the forest intact. Thus, some environmentalists argue that Tropicorp’s actions do not serve even its own economic interest. However, the initial investment required for a successful rubber-tapping operation is larger than that needed for a cattle ranch; there is a shortage of workers employable in rubber-tapping operations; and taxes are higher on profits from rubber tapping than on profits from cattle ranching. Consequently, the environmentalists’ conclusion is probably wrong.

### Question:
In the economist’s argument, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first supports the conclusion of the economist’s argument; the second calls that conclusion into question.
B: B. The first states the conclusion of the economist’s argument; the second supports that conclusion.
C: C. The first supports the conclusion of the environmentalists’ argument; the second states that conclusion.
D: D. The first states the conclusion of the environmentalists’ argument; the second states the conclusion of the economist’s argument.
E: E. Each supports the conclusion of the economist’s argument. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 According to an economist, the firm Tropicorp has been investing in tropical forest that it has cleared for cattle ranching. But its new pastures are useless for grazing after a few years. In contrast, rubber tapping—which would avoid cutting trees—could be more profitable. According to the economist, environmentalists consequently argue that Tropicorp’s investment does not serve the firm’s economic interest. However, the economist argues, investing in rubber tapping involves some potential costs and risks greater than those that investing in cattle ranching involves. Consequently, the economist argues, the environmentalists’ conclusion is probably wrong.
### Reasoning: 
 What function is served by the statement that Tropicorp’s actions do not serve even its own economic interest? What function is served by the statement that the environmentalists’ conclusion is probably wrong? The first statement is a conclusion that the economist attributes to environmentalists. The second statement is the conclusion of an argument presented by the economist.
Explanation A: A. The first states the conclusion of the argument that is attributed to environmentalists; it does not support—nor is it meant to—the conclusion of the economist.
Explanation B: B. The second statement, not the first, is the conclusion of the economist’s argument.
Explanation C: C. The first is the conclusion attributed to environmentalists and is not meant merely as support for that conclusion.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The first states the conclusion of the environmentalists’ argument as the economist presents it; the second is the conclusion of the economist’s argument.
Explanation E: E. Neither statement is meant as support for the economist’s conclusion, nor does it offer such support.

### Context:
Brown tides are growths of algae on the sea’s surface that prevent sunlight from reaching marine plants below, thereby destroying not only the plants but also the shellfish that live off these plants. Biologists recently isolated a virus that, when added to seawater, kills the algae that cause brown tides. Adding large quantities of this virus to waters affected by brown tides will therefore make it possible to save the populations of shellfish that inhabit those waters.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, provides the most support for the conclusion of the argument?
A: A. When applied in large quantities, the virus not only kills the algae that cause brown tides but also many harmless kinds of algae.
B: B. Marine animals that prey on shellfish avoid areas of the sea in which brown tides are occurring.
C: C. The number of different kinds of viruses present in seawater is far greater than many marine biologists had, until recently, believed.
D: D. The presence of large quantities of the virus in seawater does not adversely affect the growth of marine plants.
E: E. The amount of the virus naturally present in seawater in which brown tides occur is neither significantly greater nor significantly less than the amount present in seawater in which brown tides do not occur. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Brown tides—growths of algae on the sea’s surface—kill the marine plants on which certain shellfish depend, by depriving them of sunlight. Biologists have discovered a virus that, if added to seawater in large quantities, can kill the algae. An author argues that this can be a means of saving the shellfish populations.
### Reasoning: 
 Which of the answer choices most strongly supports the conclusion of the argument? The argument concludes that adding large quantities of the virus to seawater infected by brown tides will help the shellfish survive. Any new information suggesting that the virus would, directly or indirectly, help the shellfish survive supports the conclusion. But the conclusion would be questionable if the virus could directly or indirectly harm the shellfish in a way that would outweigh any benefits the virus provides. New information indicating that this would not occur could provide support for the argument.
Explanation A: A. This information suggests that deployment of the virus could have undesirable side effects, but it neither supports nor casts doubt on the conclusion. We have no information suggesting that killing algae other than those that produce brown tides would, directly or indirectly, help the shellfish survive.
Explanation B: B. This information neither supports nor casts doubt on the conclusion. It indicates a way in which brown tides indirectly provide a benefit to shellfish, even if the indirect harm they cause to shellfish outweighs that benefit.
Explanation C: C. This information indicates that certain viruses can survive in seawater environments, but this information, by itself, neither supports nor casts doubt on the conclusion.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This information indicates that the virus the biologists isolated does not directly harm the marine plants on which shellfish depend. Therefore, it provides significant support for the conclusion by indicating that the virus will not harm the shellfish indirectly by harming their food source.
Explanation E: E. This information suggests that only large quantities of the virus the biologists isolated will be effective in eliminating brown tides. But the conclusion of the argument specifies that the virus would need to be added in large quantities, so the information given in this answer choice provides no additional support for the conclusion.

### Context:
In persons with astigmatism, the clear outer layer of the eye is deformed in a way that impairs and sometimes distorts vision. The elongated figures in the paintings of El Greco (1541–1614) were so unusual that some critics sought to explain them by hypothesizing that, without knowing it, El Greco had an astigmatism that caused everything to appear to him in the distorted way that was characteristic of his painted figures.

### Question:
The proposed explanation is most vulnerable to the criticism that it fails to
A: A. establish that during the period in which El Greco lived, there was any correction available to those who did realize their vision was distorted
B: B. provide evidence that astigmatism was common in the 1500s and 1600s
C: C. consider that the critics who proposed the explanation might have suffered from astigmatism
D: D. consider the effect of the hypothesized astigmatism on El Greco’s perception of his own paintings
E: E. allow for the possibility that artists see the world differently than do nonartists Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Figures in the paintings of El Greco are strikingly elongated. Some art critics have hypothesized that this was an unintentional result of his having a type of astigmatism that made things look elongated to him.
### Reasoning: 
 What is a significant weakness in the critics’ explanation? Reasons to doubt the explanation could include any evidence that another explanation is more likely to be true or that the situation envisioned in the explanation may be impossible or inconsistent with the phenomena to be explained. For example, if only human figures in El Greco’s paintings were elongated while other similarly shaped objects were not, that observation would be inconsistent with the claim that the elongations were due to a general distortion in his vision. Answer choice D presents a similar reason to think that the proposed explanation is inconsistent with the facts. If El Greco perceived human models as more elongated than they appear to non-astigmatic perceivers, he would also have perceived his depictions of such models as more elongated than those depictions appear to non-astigmatic perceivers. So if he had intended to depict the figures accurately, he would have adjusted his painting accordingly, and his depictions should appear accurately shaped to typical viewers. But they do not. Therefore, the distortions were more likely intentional.
Explanation A: A. The hypothesis of some critics is that El Greco may have had astigmatism without being aware of it. So, the explanation does not depend on whether astigmatism could have been corrected during the period in which El Greco lived.
Explanation B: B. The reasoning concerning the hypothesis of some critics does not depend on whether astigmatism was common in the 1500s or 1600s. It is entirely consistent with the hypothesis that astigmatism was rare and that El Greco was one of the few people who had it.
Explanation C: C. Even if the critics who proposed the explanation had astigmatism, the explanation and the reasoning concerning the explanation would not be rendered faulty. The information provided is that the figures in El Greco’s paintings were unusually elongated, not merely that they appear elongated to the critics mentioned.
Explanation D: D. Correct. According to the art critics’ hypothesis, El Greco did not intend the figures in his paintings to be unnaturally elongated and did not know that they were. But this is the opposite of what one should expect if he had a type of astigmatism that made things look elongated to him. His astigmatism should have made the elongated figures in his paintings appear to him even more elongated than they appear to typical observers. So, regardless of whether he had astigmatism or not, the elongations were most likely intentional. If they were intentional, this feature of his paintings provides no more evidence that he had astigmatism than that he did not.
Explanation E: E. The explanation offered by the critics is entirely compatible with the possibility that artists see the world differently than do nonartists. One might wonder whether this possibility provides an alternative explanation for why El Greco painted elongated figures: he did so because he, like all artists, saw the world differently than nonartists do. But that hypothesis does not offer a coherent alternative to the critics’ explanation. If all artists see the world as El Greco did, we should expect them all to depict the world as he did. However, most do not. If, on the other hand, El Greco’s way of perceiving the world was only one of many ways in which artists’ perceptions differ from those of nonartists, this provides no reason to think that the difference between El Greco’s work and others’ was not caused by astigmatism.

### Context:
Marketing executive for Magu Corporation: Whenever Magu opens a manufacturing facility in a new city, the company should sponsor, or make donations to, a number of nonprofit organizations in that city. Doing so would improve Magu’s image in the community, and thus the money spent on such charitable ventures would lead to increased sales. Which statement would, if true, point to the most serious weakness in the marketing

### Question:
executive’s advice?
A: A. Magu sells its products internationally, so sales in any one city represent only a small portion of total revenue.
B: B. Spending on charitable ventures would require Magu to decrease direct advertisements, which are the most effective means of reaching its target customers.
C: C. If market conditions change, Magu may have to close any such facility or relocate it.
D: D. Some nonprofit organizations are poorly organized, so money donated to them would be of little benefit to the community.
E: E. If workers at the manufacturing facility believed their wages or working conditions were poor, their complaints would outweigh any good impressions generated by Magu’s donations or sponsorships. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A marketing executive for Magu Corporation argues that Magu can increase its sales if it sponsors or donates to nonprofit organizations in any city in which it opens a new manufacturing facility, because doing so would improve its image in that city and increase sales.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most strongly suggest that Magu would not increase sales even if it followed the plan proposed by the marketing executive? Sponsoring or donating to nonprofit organizations would require the use of financial assets that therefore cannot be spent elsewhere. If as a result Magu had to cut other expenditures that drive sales more effectively than funding nonprofit organizations drives sales, the plan may not succeed.
Explanation A: A. Because Magu sells its products internationally and no one city represents more than a small portion of revenue, any increase in sales in any given city will have only a slight effect on total sales; nonetheless, sales could still rise.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If sponsoring or donating to a nonprofit would require Magu to reduce advertising, and advertising is the most effective means of reaching its target customers, then any positive influence on sales resulting from the charitable venture might be overwhelmed by a decrease in sales because of the advertising cuts.
Explanation C: C. The fact that Magu might have to close or relocate one of these new facilities does not suggest that the marketing executive’s plan would not work; Magu’s image could nonetheless improve and sales could increase as a result.
Explanation D: D. Even if some nonprofit organizations are poorly organized, others may not be, and Magu could limit its support to those.
Explanation E: E. Even if such complaints from workers would outweigh any benefit arising from Magu’s support of nonprofit organizations, this does not indicate that the marketing executive’s plan will not work, because we have no reason to think that the workers will in fact be dissatisfied with their wages or working conditions.

C: C. Crops grown from the genetically engineered seeds require significantly more fertilizer and water to grow well than do crops grown from nonengineered seeds.
D: D. In the future, the cost of genetically engineered seeds is likely to fall to the level of nonengineered seeds.
E: E. The crops that now require the greatest expenditure on pesticides are not the ones for which genetically engineered seeds will become available. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Farmers who grow crops with seeds that have been genetically engineered to produce crops resistant to insect damage will be able to spend less on pesticides. Though these seeds are more expensive than regular seeds, this greater cost will be more than compensated for by lower expenditures on pesticides.
### Reasoning: 
 What claim most weakens the argument’s support for the claim that farmers who grow crops from these genetically engineered seeds will be able to reduce their costs by using them? The argument gives us good reason to think that even though these seeds are more expensive, the added expense is less than the amount that farmers will save by reducing their pesticide usage. But the argument does not tell us how the use of these seeds affects other costs the farmer might have. If, for instance, crops grown from these seeds require greater use of fertilizer or water, costs may stay stable or even increase.
Explanation A: A. The argument’s conclusion is only that farmers who grow crops using these seeds will be able to reduce their costs. The argument does not claim that every farmer will be able to reduce costs for every crop the farmer produces.
Explanation B: B. If the cost of pesticides will increase in the next few years, this gives us some reason to believe that farmers who use these genetically engineered seeds to grow crops will have lower costs than they would have if they used other seeds to grow the same crops. That strengthens rather than weakens the argument’s support for its conclusion.
Explanation C: C. Correct. As discussed above, if crops grown with the genetically engineered seeds require the use of more fertilizer or water, the farmer who uses such seeds may not see a reduction in costs.
Explanation D: D. If the genetically engineered seeds eventually become no more expensive than regular seeds, then it is more likely that farmers growing crops with these genetically engineered seeds will see their costs reduced.
Explanation E: E. This answer choice indicates that farmers will not be able to reduce costs as much as they might if all crops could be grown using seeds that are genetically engineered to produce crops resistant to insect damage. That, however, is fully consistent with the possibility that if farmers grow crops using the genetically engineered seeds that are available, they will thereby be able to reduce their costs.

### Context:
Educational theorist: Recent editorials have called for limits on the amount of homework assigned to schoolchildren younger than 12. They point out that free-time activities play an important role in childhood development and that homework in large quantities can severely restrict children’s free time, hindering their development. But the actual average homework time for children under 12—little more than 30 minutes per night—leaves plenty of free time. In reality, therefore, the editorials’ rationale cannot justify the restriction they advocate. Which of the following, if true, would most seriously call into question the educational

### Question:
theorist’s conclusion?
A: A. Some teachers give as homework assignments work of a kind that research suggests is most effective educationally when done in class.
B: B. For children younger than 12, regularly doing homework in the first years of school has no proven academic value, but many educators believe that it fosters self-discipline and time management.
C: C. Some homework assignments are related to free-time activities that children engage in, such as reading or hobbies.
D: D. A substantial proportion of schoolchildren under 12, particularly those in their first few years of school, have less than 10 minutes of homework assigned per night.
E: E. Some free-time activities teach children skills or information that they later find useful in their schoolwork. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 An educational theorist points out that recent editorials have called for limits on the amount of homework assigned to children under the age of 12, since large amounts of homework can restrict the sort of free-time activities that are crucial to their development. The theorist argues that such restrictions are not justified, because children under 12 spend on average only 30 minutes on homework. That leaves plenty of time for other activities.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most seriously call the theorist’s conclusion into question? The theorist gives only the average amount of time children under the age of 12 spend on homework. However, the editorials advocated a limit on the maximum amount of homework assigned, not on the average amount across all schoolchildren. There could be a wide variation among the amounts of time different children spend on homework. While a large number of children may spend only a short amount of time on homework, some children may spend much longer. For those who have the greater amounts of homework, this might leave little time for important free-time activities.
Explanation A: A. This claim, if true, may suggest that certain types of homework that teachers assign would be better done in class. It might be best not to give such assignments for homework, but that does not give us much reason to think that the amount of homework should be restricted.
Explanation B: B. This choice indicates that, despite a possible objection to assigning homework, homework does have value. That does not tell us, though, whether the maximum amount of homework that is assigned is too much, too little, or just right.
Explanation C: C. This claim could be true and yet children could still be left with too little time for important free-time activities.
Explanation D: D. Correct. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the educational theorist draws a conclusion regarding whether there should be a limit on the maximum amount of homework assigned to children under 12 and bases this conclusion solely on the average amount of time children under the age of 12 spend on homework. This conclusion would not be well supported if there is a wide variation in the amount of time children under the age of 12 spend on homework and if some—perhaps in the lower grades—spend only a very short amount of time on it. Suppose, for instance, as this answer choice has, that less than 10 minutes of homework is assigned to some of these children each night. If that were the case, then because the average amount of time schoolchildren under the age of 12 spend on homework each night is 30 minutes, that would mean that many schoolchildren may be spending far more than 30 minutes a night on homework. If so, then those children may not have enough free time for other important activities. That might mean that it would be appropriate to put limits on the amount of homework assigned to children under the age of 12.
Explanation E: E. This claim shows that some free-time activities are important for schoolwork later in life. But that does not tell us whether the maximum amount of homework that is assigned is too much, too little, or just right.

### Context:
Thyrian lawmaker: Thyria’s Cheese Importation Board inspects all cheese shipments to Thyria and rejects shipments not meeting specified standards. Yet only 1 percent is ever rejected. Therefore, since the health consequences and associated economic costs of not rejecting that 1 percent are negligible, whereas the board’s operating costs are considerable, for economic reasons alone the board should be disbanded. Consultant: I disagree. The threat of having their shipments rejected deters many cheese exporters from shipping substandard product.

### Question:
The consultant responds to the lawmaker’s argument by
A: A. rejecting the lawmaker’s argument while proposing that the standards according to which the board inspects imported cheese should be raised
B: B. providing evidence that the lawmaker’s argument has significantly overestimated the cost of maintaining the board
C: C. objecting to the lawmaker’s introducing into the discussion factors that are not strictly economic
D: D. pointing out a benefit of maintaining the board which the lawmaker’s argument has failed to consider
E: E. shifting the discussion from the argument at hand to an attack on the integrity of the cheese inspectors Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The Thyrian lawmaker argues that the Cheese Importation Board should be disbanded, because its operating costs are high and it rejects only a small percentage of the cheese it inspects. The consultant disagrees, pointing out that the board’s inspections deter those who export cheese to Thyria from shipping substandard cheese.
### Reasoning: 
 What strategy does the consultant use in the counterargument? The consultant indicates to the lawmaker that there is a reason to retain the board that the lawmaker has not considered. The benefit the board provides is not that it identifies a great deal of substandard cheese and rejects it (thus keeping the public healthy), but that the possibility that their cheese could be found substandard is what keeps exporters from attempting to export low-quality cheese to Thyria.
Explanation A: A. The consultant does reject the lawmaker’s argument, but the consultant does not propose higher standards. Indeed, in suggesting that the board should be retained, the consultant implies that the board’s standards are appropriate.
Explanation B: B. The consultant does not provide any evidence related to the board’s cost.
Explanation C: C. The only point the lawmaker raises that is not strictly economic is about the health consequences of disbanding the board, but the consultant does not address this point at all.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This statement properly identifies the strategy the consultant employs in his or her counterargument. The consultant points out that the board provides a significant benefit that the lawmaker did not consider.
Explanation E: E. The consultant does not attack the integrity of the cheese inspectors; to the contrary, the consultant says that their inspections deter the cheese exporters from shipping substandard cheese.

### Context:
The tulu, a popular ornamental plant, does not reproduce naturally and is only bred and sold by specialized horticultural companies. Unfortunately, the tulu is easily devastated by a contagious fungal rot. The government ministry plans to reassure worried gardeners by requiring all tulu plants to be tested for fungal rot before being sold. However, infected plants less than 30 weeks old have generally not built up enough fungal rot in their systems to be detected reliably. And many tulu plants are sold before they are 24 weeks old. Which of the following, if performed by the government ministry, could logically be expected

### Question:

A: A. Releasing a general announcement that tulu plants less than 30 weeks old cannot be effectively tested for fungal rot
B: B. Requiring all tulu plants less than 30 weeks old to be labeled as such
C: C. Researching possible ways to test tulu plants less than 24 weeks old for fungal rot
D: D. Ensuring that tulu plants are not sold before they are 30 weeks old
E: E. Quarantining all tulu plants from horticultural companies at which any case of fungal rot has been detected until those tulu plants can be tested for fungal rot Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 There is a contagious fungal rot that devastates the tulu, a popular ornamental plant. To reassure worried gardeners, the government ministry plans to require that tulu plants be tested for the rot before being sold. However, many tulu plants are sold before they are 24 weeks old, yet fungal rot in plants less than 30 weeks old generally cannot be detected reliably.
### Reasoning: 
 What could the government ministry do to overcome the problem? The problem arises from the fact that tulu plants are frequently sold before they are 24 weeks old, which is too soon for any fungal rot that is present to have built up enough in their root systems to be detected. Since the goal of the testing is to ensure that infected tulu plants are not sold, an obvious solution would be to make sure that no plants are sold before they are old enough for fungal rot to have built up to a detectable level. Thus, tulu plants should not be sold before they are 30 weeks old.
Explanation A: A. Releasing such an announcement would help overcome the problem if it guaranteed that no one would buy or sell tulu plants before the plants were 30 weeks old, but it is far from certain that it would guarantee this.
Explanation B: B. Similar to A, introducing such labeling would help overcome the problem if it guaranteed that no one would buy or sell tulu plants before the plants were 30 weeks old, but it is far from certain that it would guarantee this.
Explanation C: C. There is no guarantee that such research will be successful at reducing the age at which tulu plants can be reliably tested.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If the government ensures that no tulu plants less than 30 weeks of age are sold, then the specific problem mentioned in the passage would be overcome.
Explanation E: E. This will not help overcome the problem. Such a quarantine program might lead horticultural companies to start selling tulu plants only if they are less than 24 weeks old, thereby minimizing the chance of quarantine by minimizing the chance of detection.

### Context:
While many people think of genetic manipulation of food crops as being aimed at developing larger and larger plant varieties, some plant breeders have in fact concentrated on discovering or producing dwarf varieties, which are roughly half as tall as normal varieties. Which of the following would, if true, most help to explain the strategy of the plant breeders

### Question:
referred to above?
A: A. Plant varieties used as food by some are used as ornamentals by others.
B: B. The wholesale prices of a given crop decrease as the supply of it increases.
C: C. Crops once produced exclusively for human consumption are often now used for animal feed.
D: D. Short plants are less vulnerable to strong wind and heavy rains.
E: E. Nations with large industrial sectors tend to consume more processed grains. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Some plant breeders have concentrated on discovering or producing certain species of food crop plants to be roughly half as tall as normal varieties.
### Reasoning: 
 Why would some plant breeders concentrate on discovering or producing smaller varieties of certain food crops? Presumably, these breeders would not seek smaller varieties of plant crops unless the smaller size conveyed some benefit. If short plants were less vulnerable to strong wind and heavy rains, they would be apt to be more productive, other things being equal. Plant breeders would have reason to try to discover or produce such more productive varieties.
Explanation A: A. This statement doesn’t indicate whether those who use the plants as ornamentals desire shorter varieties.
Explanation B: B. At most this suggests that higher productivity is not as much of an advantage as it otherwise would be. But there is nothing in the passage that indicates that smaller varieties would be more productive than normal-sized plants.
Explanation C: C. No reason is given for thinking that smaller varieties of plants are more conducive to use for animal feed than are larger varieties.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This answer choice is correct because—unlike the other choices—it helps explain why smaller plant varieties could sometimes be preferable to larger varieties. A plant that is less vulnerable to wind and rain is apt to suffer less damage. This is a clear advantage that would motivate plant breeders to try to discover or produce smaller varieties.
Explanation E: E. This has no direct bearing on the question posed. Processed grains are not even mentioned in the passage, let alone linked to smaller plant varieties.

### Context:
Secret passwords are often used to control access to computers  When employees select their own passwords, they frequently choose such easily guessed passwords as their initials or birth dates. To improve security, employers should assign randomly generated passwords to employees rather than allowing employees to make up their own.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the conclusion drawn above?
A: A. If passwords are generated randomly, it is theoretically possible that employees will be assigned passwords that they might have selected on their own.
B: B. Randomly generated passwords are so difficult for employees to recall that they often record the passwords in places where the passwords could be easily seen by others.
C: C. Computer systems protected by passwords are designed to ignore commands that are entered by employees or others who use invalid passwords.
D: D. In general, the higher the level of security maintained at the computer system, the more difficult it is for unauthorized users to obtain access to the system.
E: E. Control of physical access to computers by the use of locked doors and guards should be used in addition to passwords in order to maintain security. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Passwords are intended to control access to computers, limiting access only to intended users. Employees often choose easily guessed passwords. To improve security, therefore, employers should assign randomly generated passwords.
### Reasoning: 
 What would significantly undermine the argument’s conclusion? Any evidence that suggests that assigning randomly generated passwords would be no more likely to be secure than employee-generated passwords would undermine the conclusion.
Explanation A: A. Even if in theory a randomly generated password could assign an employee a password the employee might have selected, that in actuality is extremely improbable.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If employees frequently record their randomly generated passwords where people who are not intended to have access to their computers can easily see them, as this option indicates, then such randomly generated passwords might in such cases reduce rather than increase security.
Explanation C: C. This detail is irrelevant because the issue is whether an unauthorized user can easily enter a valid password, not an invalid one.
Explanation D: D. This does not undermine the conclusion because the issue is whether the proposed plan does in fact increase the level of security maintained at the computer system.
Explanation E: E. This does not undermine the conclusion because this simply details a possible security measure that could be employed in addition to passwords.

### Context:
The economy around Lake Paqua depends on fishing of the lake’s landlocked salmon population. In recent years, scarcity of food for salmon there has caused a decline in both the number and the size of the adult salmon in the lake. As a result, the region’s revenues from salmon fishing have declined significantly. To remedy this situation, officials plan to introduce shrimp, which can serve as a food source for adult salmon, into Lake Paqua. Which of the following, if true, most seriously calls into question the plan’s chances for

A: A. Salmon is not a popular food among residents of the Lake Paqua region.
B: B. Tourists coming to fish for sport generate more income for residents of the Lake Paqua region than does commercial fishing.
C: C. The shrimp to be introduced into Lake Paqua are of a variety that is too small to be harvested for human consumption.
D: D. The primary food for both shrimp and juvenile salmon is plankton, which is not abundant in Lake Paqua.
E: E. Fishing regulations prohibit people from keeping any salmon they have caught in Lake Paqua that are smaller than a certain minimum size. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 In recent years, scarcity of food for landlocked salmon in Lake Paqua has led to a decline in number and size of the salmon there, leading to a decline in revenues from salmon fishing, on which the area’s economy depends. Officials plan to remedy this situation by introducing shrimp, a common food source for adult salmon, into Lake Paqua.
### Reasoning: 
 What would seriously undermine the plan’s chances for success? Note that shrimp are described as a food source for adult salmon. If there were good reason to think that shrimp cannot serve as a significant source of food for juvenile salmon—or that shrimp would not be able to live sustainably in the lake— there would be reason to be skeptical of the plan’s eventual success.
Explanation A: A. Whether salmon is a popular food among residents around Lake Paqua is not particularly relevant to the question of whether introducing shrimp will help the salmon population there rebound.
Explanation B: B. Nothing in the plan depends on whether salmon fishing’s primary contribution to the economy of the Lake Paqua region comes from tourists fishing or from commercial fishing.
Explanation C: C. The plan does not depend on the shrimp being usable as a human food source, only on their utility as food for salmon.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If the plan does not resolve the food source problem for juvenile shrimp, then the salmon may not survive to adulthood. Furthermore, because shrimp depend on plankton, which are not plentiful in the lake, any relief that the introduction of shrimp may provide will likely not be sustainable.
Explanation E: E. If anything, this would seem likely to assist the plan, by aiding in restoring the salmon population in the lake.

### Context:
Airline representative: The percentage of flight delays caused by airline error decreased significantly this year. This indicates that airlines listened to complaints about preventable errors and addressed the problems. Although delays caused by weather and other uncontrollable factors will always be part of travel, preventable delays are clearly decreasing.

### Question:
Which of the following most clearly points to a logical flaw in the representative’s reasoning?
A: A. Airlines may be motivated by financial concerns to underreport the percentage of flight delays caused by airline error.
B: B. The delays caused by uncontrollable factors could have led to an increase in complaints to airlines.
C: C. Complaints may not be the most reliable measure of how many errors occurred in a given year.
D: D. Delays caused by weather and other uncontrollable factors could have increased dramatically during the year under discussion.
E: E. Airline customers might not believe that particular delays were caused by uncontrollable factors rather than airline error. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 According to an airline representative, the percentage of flight delays caused by airline error decreased significantly this year. The representative concludes that airlines have addressed preventable errors reported by travelers.
### Reasoning: 
 Which of the answer choices most clearly suggests a logical flaw in the reasoning of the airline representative? Flight delays can be caused in many ways: for example, by unpredictable bad weather, mechanical or computer failures, bad management, or some combination of these. Some but not all errors of these kinds—and the flight delays they might cause—are preventable. Note that the argument is focused on the percentage of all flight delays that are airline-error (AE) delays. This percentage can decrease by (1) a reduction in the number of AE delays or (2) an increase in the number of non-AE delays, i.e., those delays that the airline could not have prevented. Even if a significant increase occurred in the number of AE delays, such delays could have decreased as a percentage of all flight delays if there had been a large enough increase in non- AE flight delays.
Explanation A: A. The hypothesis stated in this answer choice offers a slight, indirect basis for wondering whether the information on which the representative bases the reasoning is accurate. However, it provides no direct grounds for supposing that the reasoning itself is logically flawed. Even to the extent that this gives any reason to doubt the truth of the purported information, the relevance is very indirect. Even if airlines may have a motivation to underreport the percentage of flight delays caused by airline error, there is little reason to suppose that the representative’s information may be a result of any airline’s acting on such a motivation. And the representative argues on the basis of a decrease in the percentage, not on the basis of any particular percentage. If airlines systematically underreported the percentages, a decrease would still likely be significant.
Explanation B: B. This is only remotely relevant because the representative’s quantitative comparison is about a difference in percentage of actual delays due to certain factors, not about a difference in numbers of complaints about such delays. In principle, if the total number of complaints increased and the increase was at least partially attributable to delays caused by uncontrollable factors, this information could suggest that the number of delays caused by uncontrollable factors might have increased. This, in turn, could indirectly suggest the hypothesis stated in answer choice D. But at best the relevance of answer choice B to such a hypothesis is very oblique and conjectural.
Explanation C: C. The issue being discussed primarily concerns flight delays. Airlines could make many kinds of errors that do not lead to flight delays and that generally do not elicit complaints from air travelers.
Explanation D: D. Correct. As explained above, if there is a large enough increase in non-AE flight delays— delays entirely due to factors outside an airline’s control—then the overall number of flight delays also increases, provided the number of AE flight delays remains constant or also increases. So, even if the number of AE flight delays did not decrease, the percentage of all flight delays that were AE flight delays could decrease.
Explanation E: E. Air travelers who experience flight delays and disbelieve the explanations given by airlines for those delays may be justified in doing so—but in many, or even most, cases also may be mistaken. We have no information as to how this would affect the number of complaints from travelers. Certainly, the general level of trust between airlines and their customers does not affect the facts regarding the rate of AE flight delays or the rate of non-AE flight delays.

### Context:
Although the school would receive financial benefits if it had soft drink vending machines in the cafeteria, we should not allow them. Allowing soft drink machines there would not be in our students’ interest. If our students start drinking more soft drinks, they will be less healthy.

### Question:
The argument depends on which of the following?
A: A. If the soft drink vending machines were placed in the cafeteria, students would consume more soft drinks as a result.
B: B. The amount of soft drinks that most students at the school currently drink is not detrimental to their health.
C: C. Students are apt to be healthier if they do not drink soft drinks at all than if they just drink small amounts occasionally.
D: D. Students will not simply bring soft drinks from home if the soft drink vending machines are not placed in the cafeteria.
E: E. The school’s primary concern should be to promote good health among its students. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Allowing soft drink vending machines in a school cafeteria would financially benefit the school, but students who drink more soft drinks would become less healthy.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true in order for the claim that students drinking more soft drinks would cause them to become less healthy to justify the conclusion that soft drink vending machines should not be allowed in the cafeteria? The argument is that because drinking more soft drinks would be unhealthy for the students, allowing the vending machines would not be in the students’ interest, so the vending machines should not be allowed. This reasoning depends on the implicit factual assumption that allowing the vending machines would result in the students drinking more soft drinks. It also depends on the implicit value judgment that receiving financial benefits should be less important to the school than preventing a situation that would make the students less healthy.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If the cafeteria vending machines would not result in students consuming more soft drinks, then allowing the machines would not harm the students’ health in the way the argument assumes.
Explanation B: B. Even if the amount of soft drinks the students currently drink were unhealthy, enabling the students to drink more could make them even less healthy.
Explanation C: C. Even if drinking small amounts of soft drinks occasionally would not harm the students, vending machines in the cafeteria could lead the students to drink excessive amounts.
Explanation D: D. Even if students who cannot buy soft drinks in the cafeteria sometimes bring them from home instead, adding vending machines in the cafeteria could increase the students’ overall soft drink consumption.
Explanation E: E. A concern does not have to be the primary one in order to be valid and important. It could be held that promoting students’ good health should not be the schools’ primary concern but should still be a more important concern than the financial benefits from the vending machines.

 What conclusion do the stated facts most strongly support? We are told that lower blood lactate levels correspond consistently to higher muscular reabsorption of oxygen. Since athletes who breathe pure oxygen after exercise have blood lactate levels practically identical to those in athletes who breathe normal air, probably muscular reabsorption of oxygen does not differ significantly between athletes who breathe pure oxygen and those who breathe pure air.
Explanation A: A. Correct. As explained above, the stated facts suggest that muscular reabsorption of oxygen does not differ significantly between athletes who breathe pure oxygen and those who breathe pure air. So, breathing pure oxygen instead of normal air after exercise probably does not increase athletes’ muscular reabsorption of oxygen.
Explanation B: B. None of the statements indicates that blood lactate levels cannot be reduced by means other than inhaling pure oxygen.
Explanation C: C. We are told that blood lactate levels are negatively correlated with muscular reabsorption of oxygen. This negative correlation might allow muscular reabsorption of oxygen to be precisely determined by measuring blood lactate levels.
Explanation D: D. Muscular reabsorption of oxygen might vary for reasons unrelated to whether an athlete has been inhaling pure oxygen.
Explanation E: E. Inhaling pure oxygen might have some legitimate role unrelated to muscular reabsorption of oxygen.

### Context:
Historian: Fifteenth-century advances in mapmaking contributed to the rise of modern nation- states. In medieval Europe (from the fifth to the fifteenth century), sovereignty centered in cities and towns and radiated outward, with boundaries often ambiguously defined. The conceptual shift toward the modern state began in the late fifteenth century, when mapmakers learned to reflect geography accurately by basing maps on latitude-longitude grids. By the mid-seventeenth century, nearly all maps showed boundary lines.

### Question:
Which of the following would, if true, most strengthen the historian’s reasoning?
A: A. Borders did not become codified in Europe until certain treaties were signed in the early nineteenth century.
B: B. During the medieval period, various authorities in Europe claimed power over collections of cities and towns, not contiguous territories.
C: C. Many members of the political elite collected maps as a hobby during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.
D: D. Seventeenth-century treatises and other sources of political authority describe areas of sovereignty rather than illustrate them using maps.
E: E. During the fifteenth century in Europe, mapmakers simplified the borders of sovereignty by drawing clear lines of demarcation between political powers. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A historian claims that fifteenth-century advances in mapmaking contributed to the rise of modern nation-states. In earlier centuries, boundaries of sovereignty in Europe were poorly defined, but in the fifteenth century, maps were made based on grids showing latitude and longitude.
### Reasoning: 
reasoning.
Explanation A: A. This indicates the role of treaties in the evolution of nation-states but provides no additional support for the historian’s causal claim.
Explanation B: B. This information is consistent with the historian’s belief that nothing resembling the modern state existed before the fifteenth century, but it provides no additional support for the historian’s causal claim.
Explanation C: C. The relevance of this information to the argument is tenuous at best. There could be many nonpolitical explanations for the interest of political elites in collecting maps. Many people other than political elites may also have collected maps during the period mentioned.
Explanation D: D. This information tends to minimize the role of maps in defining areas of sovereignty and to cast some doubt on the historian’s causal claim.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This information makes explicit the role of mapmakers in providing clarity about the geographical boundaries of each political entity’s sovereignty. It thus provides additional evidence for the historian’s causal claim and strengthens the historian’s

### Context:
Sascha: The attempt to ban parliament’s right to pass directed-spending bills—bills that contain provisions specifically funding the favorite projects of some powerful politicians—is antidemocratic. Our nation’s constitution requires that money be drawn from our treasury only when so stipulated by laws passed by parliament, the branch of government most directly representative of the citizens. This requirement is based on the belief that exercising the power to spend public resources involves the ultimate exercise of state authority and that therefore _________.

### Question:
Which of the following most logically completes Sascha’s argument?
A: A. designating funding specifically for the favorite projects of some powerful politicians should be considered antidemocratic
B: B. the right to exercise such a power should belong exclusively to the branch of government most directly representative of the citizens
C: C. exercising the power to spend public resources is in most cases—but not all—protected by the constitution
D: D. modifications to any spending bills should be considered expenditures authorized by law
E: E. only officials who are motivated by concerns for reelection should retain that power Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 According to Sascha, restricting parliament’s ability to direct public money to the projects favored by powerful politicians would be undemocratic. Sascha argues that such a restriction on directed spending would be inconsistent with constitutional requirements.
### Reasoning: 
 What piece of information would most logically complete Sascha’s argument? What piece of information would most strongly associate parliament’s spending authority with the concept of democracy? A good guess would be: some information that connects parliament’s public representation role with its spending authority.
Explanation A: A. Sascha believes that democratic constitutional principles require that parliament remain free to do what is described in this sentence.
Explanation B: B. Correct. This statement makes explicit the connection, implicitly relied on by Sascha’s argument, between parliament’s spending authority and its role in representing the public.
Explanation C: C. This statement may be true but fails to associate parliament’s spending authority under the constitution with the notion of democracy.
Explanation D: D. Bills are merely works-in-progress, texts of proposed laws. Modifications of bills do not in themselves provide legal authority for any public spending item.
Explanation E: E. Sascha opposes restrictions on parliament’s spending power, and this would seem to imply that Sascha believes every parliamentary representative should be free to vote on such measures regardless of their levels of concern for reelection.

### Context:
Boreal owls range over a much larger area than do other owls of similar size  Scientists have hypothesized that it is scarcity of prey that leads the owls to range so widely. This hypothesis would be hard to confirm directly, since it is not possible to produce a sufficiently accurate count of the populations of small mammals inhabiting the forests where boreal owls live. Careful study of owl behavior has, however, shown that boreal owls do range over larger areas when they live in regions where food of the sort eaten by small mammals is comparatively sparse. This indicates that the scientists’ hypothesis is not sheer speculation.

### Question:
In the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first presents an explanatory hypothesis; the second states the main conclusion of the argument.
B: B. The first presents an explanatory hypothesis; the second presents evidence tending to support this hypothesis.
C: C. The first presents an explanatory hypothesis; the second presents evidence to support an alternative explanation.
D: D. The first describes a position that the argument opposes; the second presents evidence to undermine the support for the position being opposed.
E: E. The first describes a position that the argument opposes; the second states the main conclusion of the argument. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Boreal owls range over a much larger area than other owls of similar size. Scientists hypothesize that they do so because of prey scarcity. Counting the owls’ prey—small mammals—in the boreal owls’ habitat is inherently difficult. This makes the scientists’ hypothesis hard to confirm directly. However, it has been found that boreal owls range widely when they inhabit regions that have relatively little food for the small mammals they prey on.
### Reasoning: 
 What function is served by the statement that it is scarcity of prey that leads the owls to range so widely? What function is served by the statement that boreal owls range widely if food for their small-mammal prey is relatively sparse in the region they inhabit? The first boldfaced statement expresses an explanatory hypothesis. The passage explicitly says that this is a hypothesis and indicates that scientists have proposed this hypothesis as a tentative explanation for the comparatively wide range of boreal owls. The second boldfaced statement provides some indirect evidence for the scientists’ hypothesis. The final sentence of the passage says that the immediately preceding idea (expressed in the second boldfaced portion) indicates that the scientists’ hypothesis (the first boldfaced portion) is not mere speculation. The evidence expressed in this second boldfaced portion is indirect in that it depends heavily on further assumptions and is not sufficient to prove the hypothesis.
Explanation A: A. The main conclusion of the argument is that the scientists’ hypothesis is not sheer speculation, i.e., that the scientists have based their hypothesis on some evidence that they have discovered. The first statement presents the scientists’ hypothesis. The second statement cites some evidence for the hypothesis and is not the main conclusion of the argument.
Explanation B: B. Correct. As explained above, the first statement presents an explanatory hypothesis, while the second cites some indirect evidence for the hypothesis.
Explanation C: C. The second statement cites some indirect evidence for the scientists’ hypothesis, not for some other hypothesis.
Explanation D: D. The argument does not oppose the scientists’ hypothesis, presented in the first statement; the second statement cites evidence for the hypothesis and does not cite evidence for any position the argument opposes.
Explanation E: E. The second statement does not present the argument’s main conclusion. The main conclusion is that the scientists’ hypothesis is not mere speculation.

### Context:
Cognitive scientist: Using the pioneering work of comparative psychologist Gordon Gallup as a model, several studies have investigated animals’ capacity for mirror self-recognition (MSR). Most animals exposed to a mirror respond only with social behavior, such as aggression. However, in the case of the great apes, repeated exposure to mirrors leads to self-directed behaviors, such as exploring the inside of the mouth, suggesting that these animals recognize the reflection as an image of self. The implication of these studies is that the great apes have a capacity for self-awareness unique among nonhuman species.

### Question:
The cognitive scientist makes which of the following assumptions in the argument above?
A: A. Gallup’s work has established that the great apes have a capacity for MSR unique among nonhuman species.
B: B. If an animal does not have the capacity for MSR, it does not have the capacity for self- awareness.
C: C. If a researcher exposes an animal to a mirror and that animal exhibits social behavior, that animal is incapable of being self-aware.
D: D. When exposed to a mirror, all animals display either social behavior or self-directed behavior.
E: E. Animals that do not exhibit MSR may demonstrate a capacity for self-awareness in other ways. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A cognitive scientist claims that several studies, modeled on Gordon Gallup’s work, have investigated animals’ capacity for mirror self-recognition (MSR) and found that, whereas most animals exposed to a mirror exhibit only social behavior in response, great apes can come to respond with self-directed behavior. The cognitive scientist infers from this that the great apes, unique among nonhumans, have a capacity for self-awareness.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true for the studies to support the cognitive scientist’s conclusion? The implicit reasoning is that an animal has self-awareness only if the animal has the capacity for MSR; if the latter is lacking, so is the capacity for self- awareness.
Explanation A: A. The studies the cognitive scientist’s inference is based on were not necessarily conducted by Gallup himself. We are told only that they are modeled on his work.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If it were possible for an animal to have the capacity for self-awareness even if the animal lacks the capacity for MSR, then the studies would not imply that the great apes have a capacity for self-awareness that other nonhuman animal species lack.
Explanation C: C. The cognitive scientist’s reasoning does not require that an animal with the capacity for self-awareness never exhibits social behavior when exposed to a mirror; it merely requires that it does not exhibit only such behavior.
Explanation D: D. The cognitive scientist’s reasoning is compatible with an animal’s displaying no behavior in response to exposure to a mirror.
Explanation E: E. The cognitive scientist’s reasoning is compatible with the claim that an animal that does not exhibit MSR has no capacity at all for self-awareness.

### Context:
Last year a record number of new manufacturing jobs were created  Will this year bring another record? Well, any new manufacturing job is created either within an existing company or by the start-up of a new company. Within existing firms, new jobs have been created this year at well below last year’s record pace. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that the number of new companies starting up will be no higher this year than it was last year, and there is no reason to think that the new companies starting up this year will create more jobs per company than did last year’s start-ups. So clearly, the number of new jobs created this year will fall short of last year’s record.

### Question:
In the argument given, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first is a claim that the argument challenges; the second is an explicit assumption on which that challenge is based.
B: B. The first is a claim that the argument challenges; the second is a judgment advanced in support of the main conclusion of the argument.

D: D. The first provides evidence in support of the main conclusion of the argument; the second is a judgment advanced in support of that main conclusion.
E: E. The first and the second are each claims that have been advanced in support of a position that the argument opposes. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Manufacturing jobs are created either within existing companies or in start- ups. Manufacturing jobs are being created at a much slower rate this year than last year. It seems likely that the number of new start-ups will not exceed last year’s number and that the average number of manufacturing jobs per start- up will not exceed last year’s number. So, fewer manufacturing jobs are likely to be created this year than last year.
### Reasoning: 
 What function is served by the statement that within existing firms, new jobs have been created this year at well below last year’s record pace? What function is served by the statement that there is no reason to think that the new companies starting up this year will create more jobs per company than did last year’s start- ups? The first statement is one of the statements used as support for the argument’s main conclusion (the prediction about this year’s job creation). The second statement gives another premise used as support for that prediction.
Explanation A: A. The argument does not challenge the claim made by the first statement; it uses the first and the second statement as support for the argument’s main conclusion, the prediction about this year’s job creation.
Explanation B: B. The argument does not challenge the claim made by the first statement; it uses the first and second statements as support for the argument’s main conclusion.
Explanation C: C. The first provides evidence in support of the main conclusion of the argument; the second is not an objection that has been raised against the main conclusion.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The first provides evidence in support of the main conclusion of the argument; the second also provides support for the main conclusion.

### Context:
A study of ticket sales at a summer theater festival found that people who bought tickets to individual plays had a no-show rate of less than 1 percent, while those who paid in advance for all ten plays being performed that summer had a no-show rate of nearly 30 percent. This may be at least in part because the greater the awareness customers retain about the cost of an item, the more likely they are to use it. Which of the following would, if true, best serve as an alternative explanation of the results of

### Question:
the study?
A: A. The price per ticket was slightly cheaper for those who bought all ten tickets in advance.
B: B. Many people who attended the theater festival believed strongly that they should support it financially.
C: C. Those who attended all ten plays became eligible for a partial refund.
D: D. Usually, people who bought tickets to individual plays did so immediately prior to each performance that they attended.
E: E. People who arrived just before the performance began could not be assured of obtaining seats in a preferred location. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 People who bought tickets to individual plays at a theater festival had a much lower no-show rate than did people who paid in advance for all ten plays.
### Reasoning: 
 What factor other than greater awareness of the ticket costs could explain why people who bought tickets individually were more likely to attend the plays? The passage suggests that people who bought tickets individually were more likely to attend the plays because they were more vividly aware of what they had paid for each ticket. But there are other possible explanations—perhaps the people who bought the tickets individually were more eager to attend each play for its own sake, or they had other characteristics or incentives that made them more likely to attend the plays.
Explanation A: A. A slight price difference would not plausibly explain why the no-show rate was thirty times greater among those who bought all the tickets in advance than among those who bought them individually.
Explanation B: B. This could be true of many people who bought their tickets individually as well as many who bought them in advance.
Explanation C: C. This would provide an added incentive for those who bought tickets in advance to attend all the plays.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If people who bought individual tickets usually did so right before each performance, they would have much less time after buying the tickets to change their minds about whether to attend than would people who bought all the tickets in advance.
Explanation E: E. If anything, this might present an additional difficulty for those who bought individual tickets without advance planning, so it would not help to explain the lower no-show rate among buyers of individual tickets.

### Context:
Although there is no record of poet Edmund Spenser’s parentage, we do know that as a youth Spenser attended the Merchant Tailors’ School in London for a period between 1560 and 1570. Records from this time indicate that the Merchant Tailors’ Guild then had only three members named Spenser: Robert Spenser, listed as a gentleman; Nicholas Spenser, elected the Guild’s Warden in 1568; and John Spenser, listed as a “journeyman cloth-maker.” Of these, the last was likely the least affluent of the three—and most likely Edmund’s father, since school accounting records list Edmund as a scholar who attended the school at a reduced fee.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A: A. Anybody in sixteenth-century London who made clothing professionally would have had to be a member of the Merchant Tailors’ Guild.
B: B. The fact that Edmund Spenser attended the Merchant Tailors’ School did not necessarily mean that he planned to become a tailor.
C: C. No member of the Guild could become Guild warden in sixteenth-century London unless he was a gentleman.
D: D. Most of those whose fathers were members of the Merchant Tailors’ Guild were students at the Merchant Tailors’ School.
E: E. The Merchant Tailors’ School did not reduce its fees for the children of the more affluent Guild members. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Records indicate that the poet Edmund Spenser attended the Merchant Tailors’ School for a reduced fee as a youth. There is no record of his parentage, but at the time, the Merchant Tailors’ Guild had only three members named Spenser, of whom the least affluent was probably John Spenser.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true in order for the cited facts to support the conclusion that John Spenser was probably Edmund Spenser’s father? The implicit reasoning is that since Edmund Spenser attended the Merchant Tailors’ School at a reduced fee, his father must have been poor. And since John Spenser was probably the poorest of the three men named Spenser in the Merchant Tailors’ Guild, he was probably Edmund Spenser’s father. This reasoning assumes that only the children of poor parents had reduced fees at the Merchant Tailors’ School, that the children at the school generally had fathers in the Merchant Tailors’ Guild, that children in that time and place generally shared their fathers’ surnames, and that the two other Spensers in the Merchant Tailors’ Guild were not poor enough for their children to qualify for reduced fees.
Explanation A: A. John Spenser, as a tailor and member of the Guild, could have been Edmund Spenser’s father even if some other professional tailors did not belong to the Guild and did not have children at the school.
Explanation B: B. Although Edmund Spenser became a poet as an adult, he and all his classmates might have attended the school as children because they planned to become tailors.
Explanation C: C. The argument assumes that a Guild’s Warden probably would have been wealthier than a journeyman cloth-maker, but that might have been probable even if the Guild’s Warden were not a “gentleman.”
Explanation D: D. Even if most children of fathers in the Guild did not attend the school, all the children who did attend the school might have had fathers in the Guild.
Explanation E: E. Correct. If the school reduced its fees for children of wealthier Guild members, then the fact that Edmund Spenser’s fees were reduced would not provide evidence that his father was the poorest of the three Spensers in the Guild, as the argument requires.

### Context:
Hea Sook: One should not readily believe urban legends  Most legends are propagated because the moral lesson underlying them supports a political agenda. People will repeat a tale if it fits their purpose. They may not deliberately spread untruths, but neither are they particularly motivated to investigate deeply to determine if the tale they are telling is true. Kayla: But people would not repeat stories that they did not believe were true. Therefore, one can safely assume that if a story has been repeated by enough people, then it is more likely to be true.

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Hea Sook and Kayla have a difference of opinion on how likely urban legends are to be true.
### Reasoning: 
 What criticism is Kayla’s reply most vulnerable to? Hea Sook argues that because urban legends generally are propagated for political purposes, people are not particularly motivated to carefully investigate whether the story they are telling is true. These people may not be deliberately telling an untruth, but they have not taken care to establish whether the story is true. Kayla responds that people would not repeat a story that they did not believe to be true, but Hea Sook not only does not attempt to deny that, but she suggests that it may be true. Kayla ignores the fact that sometimes people believe that something is true without carefully determining whether it actually is true, and that they are less likely to verify whether it is true when the story fits their purposes.
Explanation A: A. Kayla does not specify how many people need to repeat a story before one is justified in believing it, but she does not need to. Her claim—that there is some number sufficient for such belief to be justified—could be true even if she does not specify what that number is.
Explanation B: B. It is Hea Sook, not Kayla, who asserts that political agendas are a significant factor in whether one retells a story.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Kayla does not address whether people are unlikely to verify whether a story is true if the story fits their purpose.
Explanation D: D. Kayla does not merely implicitly claim that people who repeat legends are not deliberately spreading untruths; she explicitly states this, but in this she and Hea Sook agree.
Explanation E: E. We have no reason to think that Kayla cannot distinguish people’s motivations for repeating urban legends from their motivations for repeating other types of stories. She may well be able to do this.

### Context:
Rainwater contains hydrogen of a heavy form called deuterium  The deuterium content of wood reflects the deuterium content of rainwater available to trees during their growth. Wood from trees that grew between 16,000 and 24,000 years ago in North America contains significantly more deuterium than wood from trees growing today. But water trapped in several North American caves that formed during that same early period contains significantly less deuterium than rainwater in North America contains today.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most helps to reconcile the two findings?
A: A. There is little deuterium in the North American caves other than the deuterium in the water trapped there.
B: B. Exposure to water after a tree has died does not change the deuterium content of the wood.
C: C. Industrialization in North America over the past 100 years has altered the deuterium content of rain.
D: D. Trees draw on shallow groundwater from rain that falls during their growth, whereas water trapped in caves may have fallen as rainwater thousands of years before the caves formed.
E: E. Wood with a high deuterium content is no more likely to remain preserved for long periods than is wood with a low deuterium content. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 In North America, wood from trees that grew 16,000 to 24,000 years ago contains more deuterium than wood from trees growing today. But water in caves that formed during that same period contains less deuterium than rainwater contains today.
### Reasoning: 
 What could explain the puzzling discrepancy between the observed deuterium levels in wood and in caves? Since the deuterium content of wood from trees reflects the deuterium content of rainwater available to the trees while they grew, the deuterium levels observed in wood suggests that North American rainwater contained more deuterium 16,000 to 24,000 years ago than it contains today. But this conclusion seems at odds with the low deuterium levels in water in caves that formed 16,000 to 24,000 years ago. Several factors might explain the discrepancy: the water in those caves might not be rainwater from the period when the caves formed; or some natural process might have altered the deuterium levels in the cave water or the wood; or the wood or caves in which deuterium levels were measured might be statistically abnormal somehow.
Explanation A: A. If the caves had absorbed deuterium out of the rainwater trapped in them, there would probably be deuterium in the cave walls. So, the observation that there is little deuterium in the caves apart from that in the water eliminates one possible explanation for the oddly low deuterium levels in the cave water.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that the deuterium levels in the wood accurately reflect higher deuterium levels in rainwater that fell 16,000 to 24,000 years ago, but it does not explain why the deuterium levels are so low in water in the caves that formed then.
Explanation C: C. This could explain why deuterium levels in rainwater have changed, but it does not help explain the discrepancy between the high deuterium levels in the wood and the low deuterium levels in the cave water.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If the water in the caves fell as rainwater thousands of years before the caves formed, it may date from a period when rainwater contained much less deuterium than during the period 16,000 to 24,000 years ago, and much less than today.
Explanation E: E. If wood with high deuterium content were more likely to be preserved, then wood from 16,000 to 24,000 years ago might have a high deuterium content even if the rainwater then had a low deuterium content. So the observation that wood with more deuterium is not more likely to be preserved eliminates one possible explanation for the discrepancy.

### Context:
Enforcement of local speed limits through police monitoring has proven unsuccessful in the town of Ardane. In many nearby towns, speed humps (raised areas of pavement placed across residential streets, about 300 feet apart) have reduced traffic speeds on residential streets by 20 to 25 percent. In order to reduce traffic speed and thereby enhance safety in residential neighborhoods, Ardane’s transportation commission plans to install multiple speed humps in those neighborhoods. Which of the following, if true, identifies a potentially serious drawback to the plan for

### Question:
installing speed humps in Ardane?
A: A. On residential streets without speed humps, many vehicles travel at speeds more than 25 percent above the posted speed limit.
B: B. Because of their high weight, emergency vehicles such as fire trucks and ambulances must slow almost to a stop at speed humps.
C: C. The residential speed limit in Ardane is higher than that of the nearby towns where speed humps were installed.
D: D. Motorists who are not familiar with the streets in Ardane’s residential districts would be likely to encounter the speed humps unawares unless warned by signs and painted indicators.
E: E. Bicyclists generally prefer that speed humps be constructed so as to leave a space on the side of the road where bicycles can travel without going over the humps. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Ardane’s difficulty in getting compliance with speed limits has led it to propose the installation of speed humps to slow traffic. In nearby towns, speed humps have reduced speeds in residential areas by up to 25 percent.
### Reasoning: 
 Which one of the statements presented identifies a major disadvantage of the proposed installation of speed humps? Is it possible that they might slow traffic too much? Clearly, there is a general need for traffic to flow smoothly. Would speed humps affect all types of traffic equally? Perhaps not. For example, certain emergency vehicles must sometimes need to travel quickly through residential neighborhoods. A problem with speed humps is that some heavier vehicles must go very slowly over speed humps.
Explanation A: A. This indicates a drawback of not installing speed humps.
Explanation B: B. Correct. This information indicates a significant drawback—possibly leading to loss of life and property—of the plan to install the speed humps.
Explanation C: C. This suggests that installing speed humps might lower speeds significantly below the current speed limits. If speeds became very low, the result could be traffic gridlock that would have unforeseen consequences. However, we have insufficient information to evaluate such possibilities.
Explanation D: D. This is unlikely to be a drawback, since such warning signs are typically put in place whenever speed humps are installed.
Explanation E: E. This information provides no evidence of a drawback in Ardane’s plan for speed humps, since the design of Ardane’s planned speed humps is not indicated.

### Context:
Which of the following most logically completes the argument below? NowNews, although still the most popular magazine covering cultural events in Kalopolis, has recently suffered a significant drop in advertising revenue because of falling circulation. Many readers have begun buying a competing magazine that, at 50 cents per copy, costs less than NowNews at $1.50 per copy. In order to boost circulation and thus increase advertising revenue, NowNews’s publisher has proposed making it available at no charge, but this

### Question:
proposal has a serious drawback, since ________.
A: A. Those Kalopolis residents with the greatest interest in cultural events are regular readers of both magazines.
B: B. One reason NowNews’s circulation fell was that its competitor’s reporting on cultural events was superior.
C: C. The newsstands and stores that currently sell NowNews will no longer carry it if it is being given away for free.
D: D. At present, 10 percent of the total number of copies of each issue of NowNews are distributed free to students on college campuses in the Kalopolis area.
E: E. NowNews’s competitor would begin to lose large amounts of money if it were forced to lower its cover price. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 NowNews is suffering declines in circulation and advertising revenue due to competition from a lower-priced magazine. The publisher proposes offering NowNews for free to reverse these declines.
### Reasoning: 
 What would suggest that the publisher’s proposal will fail to increase circulation and advertising revenue? The proposal’s intended effect is simply to increase advertising revenue by increasing circulation. Any evidence that offering the magazine for free will not result in more copies being circulated or will not attract advertisers would therefore be evidence of a drawback in the proposal. So, a statement offering such evidence would logically complete the argument.
Explanation A: A. The fact that certain highly motivated Kalopolis residents still read NowNews even at a cost of $1.50 per issue leaves open the possibility that providing the magazine free might still boost readership.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that improving its cultural reporting might help NowNews increase its circulation, not that the publisher’s proposal will fail to do so.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If the proposal leads newsstands and stores to stop carrying NowNews, circulation and advertising revenue would probably decline as a result.
Explanation D: D. Even if 10 percent of the copies of NowNews are already distributed for free, distributing the remaining 90 percent for free could still increase circulation and advertising revenue as the publisher intends.
Explanation E: E. Forcing a competing magazine to lower its cover price and lose lots of money would be an advantage rather than a drawback of the proposal, as far as the publisher of NowNews is concerned.

### Context:
Archaeologist: Researchers excavating a burial site in Cyprus found a feline skeleton lying near a human skeleton. Both skeletons were in the same sediment at the same depth and equally well-preserved, suggesting that the feline and human were buried together about 9,500 years ago. This shows that felines were domesticated around the time farming began, when they would have been useful in protecting stores of grain from mice.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the archaeologist’s argument?
A: A. Archaeologists have not found any remains of stores of grain in the immediate vicinity of the burial site.
B: B. The burial site in Cyprus is substantially older than any other known burial site in which a feline skeleton and a human skeleton appear to have been buried together.
C: C. Paintings found near the burial site seem to show people keeping felines as domestic companions but do not show felines hunting mice.
D: D. In Cyprus, there are many burial sites dating from around 9,500 years ago in which the remains of wild animals appear to have been buried alongside human remains.
E: E. Before felines were domesticated, early farmers had no effective way to protect stores of grain from mice. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A human skeleton and a feline skeleton were apparently buried together in Cyprus about 9,500 years ago.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most strongly suggest that the skeletons do not show that felines were domesticated around the time farming began? The argument implicitly assumes that farming in Cyprus began around 9,500 years ago, so evidence against that assumption would weaken the argument. The argument could also be weakened by evidence that felines were domesticated much earlier, that the feline skeleton was not from a domesticated cat, or that the two skeletons were not actually buried together around 9,500 years ago.
Explanation A: A. Even if archaeologists searched for evidence of a grain store, the fact that no such evidence was found near the burial site is at best only weak evidence that no grain store existed there or slightly farther away.
Explanation B: B. The lack of corroborating evidence from other burial sites would weaken the argument slightly but would still be compatible with the hypothesis that this site revealed one of the very first burials of a domesticated cat.
Explanation C: C. This would cast doubt on the hypothesis that cats were domesticated mainly to protect stores of grain, but not on the argument’s conclusion that cats were domesticated around the time farming began.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If many wild animals were buried alongside humans in Cyprus around 9,500 years ago, then the feline skeleton is just as likely to be that of a wild animal than that of a domesticated cat.
Explanation E: E. Since this would provide an additional reason why early farmers might have domesticated the local cats, it would strengthen rather than weaken the argument.

### Context:
Farmer: Several people in the past few years have claimed to have seen a mountain lion in the suburban outskirts—the latest just last month—and, while mountain lions were thought to have been driven from this entire region about twenty years ago, there is no reason for the people who reported seeing a mountain lion to have deliberately concocted a false report. Therefore, local wildlife managers should begin to urgently address the mountain lion’s presence.

### Question:
Which of the following would, if true, most seriously weaken the farmer’s argument?
A: A. Farmers in the suburban outskirts mostly raise cattle and hogs, which when fully grown are generally not attacked by mountain lions.
B: B. Mountain lions are dissimilar in size and color to other wild animals found near the suburban outskirts.
C: C. No person who claimed to have seen a mountain lion had anyone else with them at the purported sighting.
D: D. There have been no regional reports in the past year of mountain lions migrating to the area.
E: E. Recent surveys show that more than half of the people in the region report that they have never seen a mountain lion before. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A farmer argues that, because several people in recent years, including someone just last month, have claimed to have seen a mountain lion in the suburban outskirts, local wildlife managers need to address the mountain lion’s presence. The farmer claims that people would not intentionally create a false story about seeing a mountain lion.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most seriously call into question the farmer’s argument that because there have been reports of mountain lion sightings, wildlife managers should address the issue? Even if it is true that people would not intentionally create a false report of having seen a mountain lion, it is possible that people have mistakenly believed they have seen a mountain lion when in fact what they saw was something else. If some fact called into question the accuracy of the reports of mountain lion sightings, then the farmer’s conclusion would have weaker support.
Explanation A: A. Even if most fully grown animals raised by farmers would not be attacked by mountain lions, there could still be good reason to be concerned about the presence of mountain lions in the suburban outskirts. The mountain lion might attack animals before they are fully grown.
Explanation B: B. A dissimilarity in size and color between mountain lions and other wild animals in the area where the mountain lions were purportedly sighted would make it less likely that people mistakenly believed that an animal they spotted was a mountain lion. So, this would strengthen the farmer’s argument, not weaken it.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If there actually were at least one mountain lion in the area, and several people over a period of a few years accurately claim to have seen one, then it seems likely that on at least some occasions, a person would have been in the presence of someone else at the time, given the frequency with which people are in the company of others. So, if there have been no instances of a person reporting seeing a mountain lion when in the company of another, perhaps that is because when someone has mistakenly believed that an animal is a mountain lion, the other person helps correct the mistaken belief. With no one else present, an illusory sighting would be less likely to be corrected.
Explanation D: D. There have been purported sightings of a mountain lion in the area for several years, so presumably, if the sightings are accurate, there has been at least one mountain lion for several years, so the sightings could be accurate even if no mountain lion has migrated to the area in the past year.
Explanation E: E. It might be likely that most people living in the area would not have seen a mountain lion even if one lived in the area. For instance, the mountain lion might intentionally try to avoid people.

### Context:
The heavy traffic in Masana is a growing drain on the city’s economy—the clogging of the streets of the central business district alone cost the economy more than $1.2 billion over the past year. In order to address this problem, officials plan to introduce congestion pricing, by which drivers would pay to enter the city’s most heavily trafficked areas during the busiest times of the day.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, would most strongly indicate that the plan will be a success?
A: A. Approximately one-fifth of the vehicles in the central business district are in transit from one side of the city to the other.
B: B. Planners expect that, without congestion pricing, traffic in Masana is likely to grow by 6 percent in the next five years.
C: C. In other urban areas, congestion pricing has strongly encouraged carpooling (sharing of rides by private commuters).
D: D. Several studies have shown that a reduction in traffic of 15 percent in Masana could result in 5,500 or more new jobs.
E: E. Over 30 percent of the vehicles in the city’s center are occupied by more than one person. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Traffic congestion in Masana has been harming the city’s economy. To address the problem, officials plan to make drivers pay to enter the city’s most heavily trafficked areas during the busiest times of day.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most strongly suggest that the plan will reduce the harm to Masana’s economy from traffic congestion? In order to succeed, the plan will have to be implemented and effectively enforced. Furthermore, the prices drivers pay will have to be high enough to significantly change their behavior in ways that reduce the amount of traffic congestion in the city. Finally, the economic benefits from the reduced traffic congestion will have to substantially outweigh any economically damaging side effects of the congestion pricing. Any evidence that any of these conditions will hold would provide at least some support for the prediction that the plan will succeed.
Explanation A: A. This provides no evidence that the congestion pricing would affect the behavior of either the one-fifth of drivers whose vehicles traverse the city or of the other four-fifths of drivers, nor does it give any evidence that the plan would produce overriding economic benefits.
Explanation B: B. This indicates that the traffic problem will grow worse if the plan is not implemented, but it does not provide any evidence that the plan will help address the problem.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This indicates that similar plans have successfully changed drivers’ behavior in other cities in a way likely to reduce the number of cars on the road in heavily trafficked areas at busy times of day without producing harmful economic side effects. Thus, it provides evidence that the strategy could also be successful in Masana.
Explanation D: D. Although this suggests that reducing traffic congestion would be economically beneficial, it doesn’t provide any evidence that the plan will succeed in reducing traffic congestion.
Explanation E: E. This suggests that many drivers in the city center are already carpooling, which, if anything, indicates that the plan will be less able to further affect those drivers’ behavior and thus could be less effective than it might otherwise be.

### Context:
Economist: The most economically efficient way to reduce emissions of air pollutants is to tax them in proportion to the damage they are likely to cause. But in Country Y, many serious pollutants are untaxed and unregulated, and policy makers strongly oppose new taxes. Therefore, the best way to achieve a reduction in air pollutant emissions in Country Y would be to institute fixed upper limits on them.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption of the economist’s argument?
A: A. Policy makers in Country Y oppose all new taxes equally strongly, regardless of any benefits they may provide.
B: B. Country Y’s air pollutant emissions would not fall significantly if they were taxed in proportion to the damage they are likely to cause.
C: C. Policy makers in Country Y strongly favor reductions in air pollutant emissions.
D: D. Country Y’s policy makers believe that air pollutant emissions should be reduced with maximum economic efficiency.
E: E. Policy makers in Country Y do not oppose setting fixed upper limits on air pollutant emissions as strongly as they oppose new taxes. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Although taxing air pollution emissions in proportion to the damage they cause is the most economically efficient way to reduce those emissions, many serious pollutants in Nation Y are untaxed and unregulated, and the nation’s policy makers strongly oppose new taxes. Therefore, fixed upper limits on such emissions would more effectively reach this goal.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true in order for the factors the economist cites to support the claim that fixing upper limits on air pollutant emissions in Nation Y would be the best way to reduce those emissions? Political opposition to taxation in Nation Y is the only factor the economist cites to support the argument’s conclusion that it would be best to institute fixed upper limits on air pollutants. In order for the premise to support the conclusion, there must be less political opposition in Nation Y to instituting such limits than there would be to the proportional taxation approach the economist prefers.
Explanation A: A. Even if the policy makers oppose some new taxes less than others, they could still oppose the proportional taxation approach strongly enough for it to be utterly infeasible.
Explanation B: B. Even if the proportional taxation scheme would significantly reduce emissions, it still might not be the best approach for Nation Y if it would generate too much political opposition to be viable there.
Explanation C: C. Even if policy makers in Nation Y do not strongly favor reducing emissions, fixing upper limits on emissions might still be a better and more politically feasible way to reduce emissions than any alternative is.
Explanation D: D. Since fixing upper emissions limits would be no more economically efficient than the proportional taxation scheme, the policy makers’ support for economic efficiency would not make the former approach any more politically feasible than the latter.
Explanation E: E. Correct. If the policy makers opposed fixing upper emissions limits as strongly as they oppose new taxes, then their opposition to new taxes would no longer support the conclusion that fixing the emissions limits is a better way to reduce emissions.

### Context:
Humans get Lyme disease from infected ticks  Ticks get infected by feeding on animals with Lyme disease, but the ease of transmission from host animal to tick varies. With most species of host animal, transmission of Lyme disease to ticks is extremely rare, but white-footed mice are an exception, readily passing Lyme disease to ticks. And white-footed mouse populations greatly expand, becoming the main food source for ticks, in areas where biodiversity is in decline.

### Question:
The information in the passage most strongly supports which of the following?
A: A. In areas where many humans are infected with Lyme disease, the proportion of ticks infected with Lyme disease is especially high.
B: B. Very few animals that live in areas where there are no white-footed mice are infected with Lyme disease.
C: C. Humans are less at risk of contracting Lyme disease in areas where biodiversity is high.
D: D. Ticks feed on white-footed mice only when other host species are not available to them.
E: E. The greater the biodiversity of an area, the more likely any given host animal in that area is to pass Lyme disease to ticks. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 White-footed mice readily pass Lyme disease to ticks, which pass it to humans. White-footed mouse populations expand where biodiversity is declining.
### Reasoning: 
 What conclusion do the stated facts support? Since declining biodiversity causes white-footed mouse populations to increase, and white-footed mice are especially likely to pass Lyme disease to ticks, and ticks pass it to humans, declining biodiversity could reasonably be expected to increase the incidence of Lyme disease in both ticks and humans.
Explanation A: A. In areas where many humans are infected with Lyme disease, the total number of ticks may be unusually high, so even if the number of infected ticks is unusually high, the proportion of infected ticks may not be unusually high.
Explanation B: B. Most animals with Lyme disease may get it from sources other than ticks that have fed on infected mice.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If biodiversity is high, then any biodiversity decline that has already begun has likely not yet reached a point where white-footed mouse populations have greatly expanded, so the risk of people contracting Lyme disease is still relatively less than in areas where biodiversity is low and where significant decline in biodiversity has likely already occurred.
Explanation D: D. Even if ticks feed on white-footed mice when few other species are available for them to feed on, they may also sometimes feed on white-footed mice when there are many other species for them to feed on.
Explanation E: E. The passage suggests that the overall incidence of Lyme disease is probably lower in more biodiverse areas, so any given host animal in those areas would probably be less likely to pass Lyme disease to a tick.

### Context:
Many industrialized nations are trying to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, a gas released by the burning of fossil fuels. One proposal is to replace conventional cement, which is made with calcium carbonate, by a new “eco-cement.” This new cement, made with magnesium carbonate, absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide when exposed to the atmosphere. Therefore, using eco-cement for new concrete building projects will significantly help reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
A: A. The cost of magnesium carbonate, currently greater than the cost of calcium carbonate, probably will fall as more magnesium carbonate is used in cement manufacture.
B: B. Eco-cement is strengthened when absorbed carbon dioxide reacts with the cement.
C: C. Before the development of eco-cement, magnesium-based cement was considered too susceptible to water erosion to be of practical use.
D: D. The manufacture of eco-cement uses considerably less fossil fuel per unit of cement than the manufacture of conventional cement does.
E: E. Most building-industry groups are unaware of the development or availability of eco- cement. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Many nations are trying to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. One proposed method is to use a new type of “eco-cement” that absorbs carbon dioxide from air.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence, combined with the cited facts, would most support the prediction that using eco-cement will significantly help reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide? The prediction assumes that the use of eco-cement would be an effective way to reduce carbon dioxide levels. Any evidence supporting this assumption will support the prediction.
Explanation A: A. Since eco-cement uses magnesium carbonate, the prediction that magnesium carbonate prices will fall suggests that a potential financial barrier to widespread eco-cement use will diminish. However, those prices may not fall enough to make eco-cement cost- competitive with regular cement.
Explanation B: B. Even if absorbed carbon dioxide strengthens eco-cement, the strengthened eco-cement might still be much weaker than regular cement and thus might never become widely used, in which case it will not significantly help reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.
Explanation C: C. Even if eco-cement is less susceptible to water erosion than earlier forms of magnesium- based cement were, it might still be much more susceptible to water erosion than regular cement is, and thus might never become widely used.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This suggests that manufacturing eco-cement produces much less carbon dioxide than manufacturing regular cement does, so it supports the claim that widespread use of eco-cement would be an effective way to reduce carbon dioxide levels.
Explanation E: E. If anything, this lack of awareness makes it less likely that eco-cement will become widely used, which in turn makes it less likely that eco-cement will significantly help reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.

### Context:
Professor: A marine biologist argues that transmission of sea lice from farm salmon to wild salmon is unlikely in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, citing numerous studies suggesting that salinities less than 30 parts per thousand are unfavorable to sea-lice survival. The biologist concludes that the archipelago’s 25–30 parts per thousand salinity range between March and June, the critical period for wild salmon migration, tends to suppress sea- lice proliferation. But a review of the literature shows that salinities of 25–30 parts per thousand in combination with British Columbia’s cool spring temperatures favor the flourishing of sea lice.

### Question:
In this passage, the professor attempts to undermine the biologist’s argument by
A: A. pointing out that a condition claimed to be necessary for sea-lice survival is not sufficient for it
B: B. citing studies that suggest that salinity levels were not measured reliably
C: C. claiming that there is evidence showing that one of its premises is false
D: D. questioning the reliability of the biologist’s scientific sources
E: E. showing that its conclusion is inconsistent with its premises Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A professor gives us information about one biologist’s opinion, based on numerous studies, about the low probability of sea-lice transmission from farm salmon to wild salmon in the Broughton Archipelago. The biologist thinks salinities less than 30 parts per thousand (ppt) would make such transmission unlikely; in the archipelago, the salinity is 25–30 ppt between March and June, the period when wild salmon migration occurs. However, the professor challenges the biologist’s view, maintaining, based on a literature review, that cool spring temperatures in the archipelago, combined with the lower salinity, do favor the flourishing of sea lice.
### Reasoning: 
 In what way does the professor attempt to undermine the biologist’s argument? The professor points out that a premise used by the biologist—that the low spring salinities in the archipelago when the wild salmon migrate suppress sea-lice proliferation—is not correct. The professor claims the academic literature reveals that two conditions—the 25–30 ppt salinities combined with the cool spring temperatures—would be jointly sufficient for the flourishing of sea lice.
Explanation A: A. This does not accurately describe the professor’s technique. In effect, the professor points out that salinities of 30 ppt or more are NOT necessary for sea-lice survival; lower salinities combined with lower temperatures are sufficient to enable sea-lice survival.
Explanation B: B. The professor cites no studies that suggest unreliable measurement of salinity levels.
Explanation C: C. Correct. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the professor appeals to evidence from the literature to show that one of the biologist’s premises is false.
Explanation D: D. The professor primarily questions the conclusion that the biologist draws from the sources; the professor does not question the reliability of the sources.
Explanation E: E. The professor undermines the biologist’s argument by claiming that one of its premises is false and thus that the conclusion might not follow. The professor does not claim that if the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be false.

 What additional evidence would suggest that Tuff motor oil provides the best available protection for car engines? The argument requires the assumptions that no type of motor oil other than the “major brands” provides superior protection, that flowing better at lower temperatures ensures superior protection at those temperatures, and that Tuff protects car engines at least as well as its competitors do at above-normal temperatures. Any evidence supporting any of these assumptions would strengthen the argument.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If Tuff provides above-average protection when engines overheat, in addition to the solid protection it provides at normal and low temperatures, it may well provide the best available protection overall.
Explanation B: B. The company that makes Tuff might give automobile manufacturers free motor oil as a promotional gimmick even if Tuff is an inferior product.
Explanation C: C. Tuff’s sales might have declined over the past three years because consumers have realized that Tuff is an inferior product.
Explanation D: D. The similar responses of Tuff and other motor oils to temperature changes do not suggest that Tuff provides better protection overall than those other motor oils do.
Explanation E: E. Even if Tuff is manufactured at only one refinery, it may still be an inferior product.

### Context:
Linguist: In English, the past is described as “behind” and the future “ahead,” whereas in Aymara, the past is “ahead” and the future “behind.” Research indicates that English speakers sway backward when discussing the past and forward when discussing the future. Conversely, Aymara speakers gesture forward with their hands when discussing the past and backward when discussing the future. These bodily movements, therefore, suggest that the language one speaks affects how one mentally visualizes time.

### Question:
The linguist’s reasoning depends on assuming which of the following?
A: A. At least some Aymara speakers sway forward when discussing the past and backward when discussing the future.
B: B. Most people mentally visualize time as running either forward or backward.
C: C. Not all English and Aymara speakers tend to sway or gesture forward or backward when discussing the present.
D: D. How people move when discussing the future correlates to some extent with how they mentally visualize time.
E: E. The researchers also examined the movements of at least some speakers of languages other than English and Aymara discussing the past and the future. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A linguist argues that the language one speaks affects how one mentally visualizes time. The linguist’s argument is based on the fact that English speakers, who refer to the past as “behind” and the future as “ahead,” display backward and forward bodily movements when speaking of the past and the future, while speakers of Aymara, who refer to the past as “ahead” and the future as “behind,” display correspondingly different body movements.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true if we are to accept the linguist’s conclusion from the given information that the language one speaks affects how one mentally visualizes time? The linguist’s evidence will support the conclusion only if there is some correlation between people’s bodily movements and how they mentally visualize time. So, the linguist’s reasoning requires an assumption to that effect.
Explanation A: A. The linguist’s reasoning is based on the differences in bodily movements discussed in the argument—that is, that Aymara speakers gesture in certain ways and that English speakers sway in certain ways; thus, the linguist’s reasoning does not require that Aymara speakers sway in any way whatsoever when they discuss the past or future.
Explanation B: B. The linguist’s reasoning is based only on speakers of English and Aymara, so no claim related to speakers of other languages—who make up a majority of people—is required.
Explanation C: C. The linguist’s argument would actually be stronger if all English and Aymara speakers sway or gesture in the ways discussed, so the argument certainly does not depend on assuming that not all such speakers sway or gesture in these ways.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The fact that English and Aymara speakers sway or gesture in the ways described would be irrelevant to the linguist’s conclusion if how people move when discussing the future does not correlate at least to some extent with how they visualize time.
Explanation E: E. It might be helpful to the linguist’s argument to examine the movements of speakers of other languages when they discuss the past and the future, but the linguist’s argument does not require this.

### Context:
The Testament of William Thorpe was published around 1530 as an appendix to Thorpe’s longer Examination. Many scholars, however, doubt the attribution of the Testament to Thorpe because, whereas the Examination is dated 1406, the Testament is dated 1460. One scholar has recently argued that the 1460 date be amended to 1409, based on the observation that when these numbers are expressed as Roman numerals, MCCCCLX and MCCCCIX, it becomes easy to see how the dates might have become confused through scribal error. Which of the following, if true, would most support the scholar’s hypothesis concerning the

### Question:
date of the Testament?
A: A. The sole evidence that historians have had that William Thorpe died no earlier than 1460 was the presumed date of publication of the Testament.
B: B. In the preface to the 1530 publication, the editor attributes both works to William Thorpe.
C: C. Few writers in fifteenth-century England marked dates in their works using only Roman numerals.
D: D. The Testament alludes to a date, “Friday, September 20,” as apparently contemporaneous with the writing of the Testament, and September 20 fell on a Friday in 1409 but not in 1460.
E: E. The Testament contains few references to historical events that occurred later than 1406. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The Testament of William Thorpe, dated 1460, was published around 1530 as an appendix to Thorpe’s Examination, dated 1406. But when expressed in Roman numerals, 1460 could easily be confused with 1409.
### Reasoning: 
 Given the facts cited, what would provide additional evidence that Thorpe’s Testament dates from 1409 rather than 1460? The scholar’s hypothesis that the work dates from 1409 is based on the observation that in Roman numerals, 1409 might easily have been improperly transcribed as 1460. What evidence would support this hypothesis? Any independent evidence that 1409 is a more likely date for the Testament than 1460 would certainly help. For instance, if some event or date that occurred in 1409 but not in 1460 is referred to in the Testament as being recent or contemporaneous, this would lend significant support to the hypothesis. For instance, if the Testament indicated that some day of the month had just fallen on a given day of the week, and that date fell on that day in 1409 but not in 1460, this would support the hypothesis significantly.
Explanation A: A. Suppose there is no reason to think that Thorpe was still alive in 1460 other than the presumption that the Testament was published in that year. That gives us no more reason to accept the scholar’s hypothesis about a scribal error in reporting the date than to accept the other scholars’ hypothesis that the Testament is improperly ascribed to Thorpe. Furthermore, it provides very little reason to support either of these hypotheses, because the mere lack of evidence, other than the purported 1460 date of creation, that Thorpe died no earlier than 1460 does not provide us with any evidence that he did die earlier than 1460.
Explanation B: B. The editor of the 1530 publication could easily have been mistaken about the authorship of one or both works. And even if the editor were correct, Thorpe might have lived long enough to write one work in 1406 and the other in 1460.
Explanation C: C. This would cast doubt on the scholar’s argument by providing evidence that the original manuscripts were not dated only in Roman numerals.
Explanation D: D. Correct. As explained in the Reasoning section above, this provides strong evidence directly supporting the hypothesis that the Testament dates from 1409 specifically.
Explanation E: E. Even if the Testament contained only one reference to a historical event that occurred later than 1406 (for example, one event in 1459), that reference alone could provide strong evidence that the work dates from 1460 rather than 1409.

### Context:
A prominent investor who holds a large stake in the Burton Tool Company has recently claimed that the company is mismanaged, citing as evidence the company’s failure to slow down production in response to a recent rise in its inventory of finished products. It is doubtful whether an investor’s sniping at management can ever be anything other than counterproductive, but in this case, it is clearly not justified. It is true that an increased inventory of finished products often indicates that production is outstripping demand, but in Burton’s case it indicates no such thing. Rather, the increase in inventory is entirely attributable to products that have already been assigned to orders received from customers.

### Question:
In the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first states a generalization that underlies the position that the argument as a whole opposes; the second provides evidence to show that the generalization does not apply in the case at issue.
B: B. The first states a generalization that underlies the position that the argument as a whole opposes; the second clarifies the meaning of a specific phrase as it is used in that generalization.
C: C. The first provides evidence to support the conclusion of the argument as a whole; the second is evidence that has been used to support the position that the argument as a whole opposes.

E: E. The first and the second each provide evidence against the position that the argument as a whole opposes. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 An investor has criticized a company, based on the company’s recent increase in inventory and on its not decreasing production as a result of this increase.
### Reasoning: 
 What roles do the two boldfaced statements play in the argument? The argument suggests that the investor’s criticism is based on a principle that increased inventory of finished products often indicates that production is faster than it should be, given the existing demand for a company’s products. However, the argument then states that the increase in inventory at the company in question is entirely attributable to existing orders of products. The argument thus suggests that the investor’s criticism is misplaced, based on a suggestion as to (1) a principle that the investor could be using to support her argument and (2) an explanation as to why the principle does not apply to the company. The two boldfaced portions state these respective elements.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The first boldfaced portion states the principle that may provide the basis of the investor’s criticism, which the argument as a whole opposes. The second boldfaced portion is a statement that, if true, shows the generalization would not apply to the company in question.
Explanation B: B. This option correctly describes the first of the boldfaced portions. However, rather than clarifying an aspect of the meaning of the first generalization, the second boldfaced portion indicates why the first generalization may not apply to the company.
Explanation C: C. This option incorrectly describes both of the boldfaced portions. The first boldfaced portion states a general principle that could support the position that the argument opposes. The second boldfaced portion then criticizes the application of the principle.
Explanation D: D. Because the second boldfaced portion describes a fundamental premise rather than the conclusion, the description in this option of the second boldfaced portion is incorrect.
Explanation E: E. If we think of an argument as a set of statements that are meant to support, or provide evidence for, a conclusion, then, because the boldfaced statements are indeed part of the argument, they may be seen as providing evidence for the position the argument opposes. However, a description of the roles of the boldfaced statements in this argument would need to provide more detail, such as what option A provides.

### Response:

### Situation: 
 After a company started requiring employees to come to work unless they were sick enough to have to go to a doctor, the company’s productivity losses from reported employee illness increased.
### Reasoning: 
 What would explain why the policy increased productivity losses from reported employee illness? Any factors that could have plausibly caused the policy to increase employee absenteeism from reported illness or to reduce the employees’ productivity at work as a result of reported illness could explain why the policy increased productivity losses from reported illness.
Explanation A: A. Even though the policy required sick employees to consult a doctor, there is no reason to think that employees’ doing so would have made them less productive than they would otherwise have been when absent from work.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that the policy made it more difficult for employees to falsely claim illness as an excuse for a work absence. Reduction in absences should result in productivity gains rather than losses.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This could have been a result of the policy and would have led to productivity losses possibly greater than those seen before the policy was introduced.
Explanation D: D. This would help to explain lower productivity losses from reported illness after the policy was implemented, not higher productivity losses.
Explanation E: E. The question is what could explain how the policy increased productivity losses from reported employee illness specifically, not productivity losses from any other factors.

### Context:
Advertising by mail has become much less effective, with fewer consumers responding Because consumers are increasingly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of junk mail they receive, most discard almost all offers without considering them. Thus, an effective way for corporations to improve response rates would be to more carefully target the individuals to whom they mail advertising, thereby cutting down on the amount of junk mail each consumer receives.

Which of the following, if true, would most support the recommendation above?
A: A. There are cost-effective means by which corporations that currently advertise by mail could improve response rates.
B: B. Many successful corporations are already carefully targeting the individuals to whom they mail advertising.
C: C. Any consumer who, immediately after receiving an advertisement by mail, merely glances at it is very likely to discard it.
D: D. Improvements in the quality of the advertising materials used in mail that is carefully targeted to individuals can improve the response rate for such mail.
E: E. Response rates to carefully targeted advertisements by mail are considerably higher, on average, than response rates to most other forms of advertising. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Advertising by mail has become less effective because consumers overwhelmed with the amount of junk mail they receive discard almost all of it without considering it.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most help to support the claim that making mail advertising more carefully targeted would improve response rates? The passage recommends targeted advertising, reasoning that since targeted advertising would reduce the total amount of junk mail consumers receive, it would generate higher response rates. Any additional evidence for the claim that carefully targeted advertising would improve response rates would support this recommendation.
Explanation A: A. Even if targeted advertising and every other means of improving response rates were too expensive to be cost-effective, targeted advertising could still be effective for any corporation willing to pay the expense.
Explanation B: B. If many corporations already mail targeted advertising, and mail advertising is nonetheless yielding declining response rates, that suggests that targeted mail is an ineffective way to increase response rates.
Explanation C: C. This could be equally true for targeted and untargeted mail advertising, so it does not suggest that the former is more effective.
Explanation D: D. The question under consideration is whether more carefully targeted mail advertising would in itself increase response rates, not whether higher quality advertising would do so.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This provides some evidence that carefully targeted mail advertising is associated with higher response rates than untargeted mail advertising is, and therefore that targeting mail advertising more carefully would improve response rates.

### Context:
Petrochemical industry officials have said that the extreme pressure exerted on plant managers during the last five years to improve profits by cutting costs has done nothing to impair the industry’s ability to operate safely. However, environmentalists contend that the recent rash of serious oil spills and accidents at petrochemical plants is traceable to cost- cutting measures. Which of the following, if true, would provide the strongest support for the position held by

### Question:
industry officials?
A: A. The petrochemical industry benefits if accidents do not occur, since accidents involve risk of employee injury as well as loss of equipment and product.
B: B. Petrochemical industry unions recently demanded that additional money be spent on safety and environmental protection measures, but the unions readily abandoned those demands in exchange for job security.
C: C. Despite major cutbacks in most other areas of operation, the petrochemical industry has devoted more of its resources to environmental and safety measures in the last five years than in the preceding five years.
D: D. There is evidence that the most damaging of the recent oil spills would have been prevented had cost-cutting measures not been instituted.
E: E. Both the large fines and the adverse publicity generated by the most recent oil spill have prompted the petrochemical industry to increase the resources devoted to oil-spill prevention. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Petrochemical industry officials claim that pressure on plant managers to cut costs over the past five years has not made the industry’s operations any less safe. Environmentalists claim that recent oil spills and accidents show otherwise.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence would most strongly suggest that the cost-cutting pressure was not responsible for the recent rash of oil spills and accidents? Evidence that the plant managers did not cut costs in any specific ways likely to have increased the likelihood of oil spills and accidents would support the industry officials’ position that the cost-cutting pressure has not made petrochemical operations any less safe.
Explanation A: A. Even if the petrochemical industry has good reasons to try to prevent accidents, the recent rash of serious accidents suggests that it is failing to do so and that the cost- cutting pressure might be responsible.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that the unions, whose members could directly observe the cost-cutting pressure’s effects, share the environmentalists’ belief that this pressure contributed to the oil spills and accidents. Because the unions abandoned their demands, their concerns probably have not been addressed.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This suggests that, as the industry officials claim, the cost-cutting pressure has not in itself reduced the industry’s effectiveness at preventing oil spills and accidents. Thus, it suggests that other factors are probably responsible for the recent problems.
Explanation D: D. This clearly suggests that the cost-cutting measures have indeed caused the industry to operate less safely, as the environmentalists claim.
Explanation E: E. Although this suggests that the industry is now trying to address the recent problems, the cost-cutting measures might nonetheless have caused all those problems.

### Context:
A company has developed a new sensing device that, according to the company’s claims, detects weak, ultralow-frequency electromagnetic signals associated with a beating heart. These signals, which pass through almost any physical obstruction, are purportedly detected by the device even at significant distances. Therefore, if the company’s claims are true, their device will radically improve emergency teams’ ability to locate quickly people who are trapped within the wreckage of collapsed buildings.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
A: A. People trapped within the wreckage of collapsed buildings usually have serious injuries that require prompt medical treatment.
B: B. The device gives a distinctive reading when the signals it detects come from human beings rather than from any other living beings.
C: C. Most people who have survived after being trapped in collapsed buildings were rescued within two hours of the building’s collapse.
D: D. Ultralow-frequency signals are not the only electromagnetic signals that can pass through almost any physical obstruction.
E: E. Extensive training is required in order to operate the device effectively. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A new sensing device can detect—at significant distances and even behind obstructions such as walls—weak, ultralow-frequency electromagnetic signals that are characteristic of heartbeats. It is predicted, based on this information, that the new device will shorten the time it currently takes to locate people buried under collapsed buildings but still alive.
### Reasoning: 
 What new information, if accurate, would provide further evidence that would support the prediction? The existing evidence fails to tell us whether the new device can distinguish between human heartbeats and heartbeats from other species. If the device does not allow the user to distinguish between the heartbeats of humans and those of animals of other species, then the prediction might not be correct, because if there are any nonhuman animals in the building, emergency teams may believe they have located a trapped human and begin a rescue effort, when in fact they have merely located an animal of some other species. Any new information that implies the device can help the user to discern between signals associated with a human heartbeat and signals associated with the heartbeats of animals of other species will strengthen support for the prediction.
Explanation A: A. This implies that prompt rescue of people trapped under collapsed buildings is vitally important. The prediction is that the new device will speed rescue of such people, but the new information here does nothing to indicate that the prediction is accurate.
Explanation B: B. Correct. As explained in the Reasoning section above, there is a crucial gap in the argument: The argument does not indicate whether the device allows the user to distinguish between signals associated with human heartbeats and signals associated with the heartbeats of other species. This information fills that gap.
Explanation C: C. Even if this is true, shortening the time for locating and rescuing people from collapsed buildings would clearly be beneficial. However, the new information given here does not make it more likely that the prediction is correct.
Explanation D: D. If this is correct, then, if anything, it somewhat undermines the evidence given for the prediction, since it raises the possibility that the detection ability of the device might be impeded by “noise” from irrelevant electromagnetic signals near the collapsed building.
Explanation E: E. This could lead to practical obstacles when using the device even in emergency situations, with the result that the device might never actually be used by competent personnel to “improve emergency teams’ ability” because the “extensive training” would cost too much.

### Context:
Economist: The price of tap water in our region should be raised drastically  Supplies in local freshwater reservoirs have been declining for years because water is being used faster than it can be replenished. Since the price of tap water has been low, few users have bothered to adopt even easy conservation measures.

### Question:
The two sections in boldface play which of the following roles in the economist’s argument?
A: A. The first is a conclusion for which support is provided, and which in turn supports the main conclusion; the second is the main conclusion.

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Local water supplies have been declining for years because of excessive water use and low prices. Few users have adopted even easy conservation measures.
### Reasoning: 
 What roles do the two boldfaced statements play in the argument? Both are factual observations. Since no further evidence or support is provided for either, neither can be a conclusion in the argument. However, interconnected causal explanations, signaled by because and since, are provided for both. The observation in the first boldfaced statement is causally explained by the further observation that water is being used faster than it can be replenished, which in turn is causally explained by the entire final sentence. The observation in the second boldfaced statement is causally explained by the observation that the price of tap water has been low. The only remaining portion of the argument is the initial sentence, a recommendation supported by these four observations together, and by the causal claims in which they are embedded. Thus, the four observations (including the two boldfaced statements) and the causal claims containing them are all premises, and the initial statement is the argument’s only conclusion.
Explanation A: A. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the two boldfaced statements are premises of the argument. Although causal explanations are provided for both, no support or evidence is provided for either. Neither statement is inferred from anything else in the argument, so neither can be a conclusion in the argument.
Explanation B: B. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the second boldfaced statement does provide part of the causal explanation for the observation in the first boldfaced statement. But the second is not a conclusion. It is not inferred from anything else in the argument, so it cannot be a conclusion in the argument.
Explanation C: C. Correct. As explained in the Reasoning section above, each of the statements is a premise that serves along with other claims to support the recommendation in the initial sentence, which is the argument’s only conclusion, and in that sense its main conclusion.
Explanation D: D. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the second boldfaced statement does provide part of the causal explanation for the observation in the first boldfaced statement. But the first is not a conclusion. It is not inferred from anything else in the argument, so it cannot be a conclusion in the argument.
Explanation E: E. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the two boldfaced statements are premises of the argument. Although causal explanations are provided for both, no support or evidence is provided for either. Neither statement is inferred from anything else in the argument, so neither can be a conclusion in the argument.

C: C. Hybrid cars have already begun to gain popularity.
D: D. Fuel-efficient alternatives to hybrid cars will likely become available in the future.
E: E. The future cost of gasoline and other fuel cannot be predicted with absolute precision or certainty. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 According to a politician, hybrid cars use less fuel per kilometer than nonhybrids, and fuel produces air pollution. Motorists can save money by driving fuel-efficient cars, and they will be encouraged to do so if made aware of the fact. The politician concludes that highlighting this fact will result in a reduction in air pollution.
### Reasoning: 
 What would suggest that telling motorists they can save money by driving fuel- efficient cars would not reduce automotive air pollution, despite the facts cited by the politician? The politician’s implicit reasoning is that since hybrid cars use less fuel per kilometer, and fuel produces air pollution, motorists who drive hybrid cars must produce less air pollution than those who drive nonhybrids. The politician concludes that encouraging motorists to drive hybrid cars by telling them they would save money on fuel will therefore reduce automotive air pollution. Evidence that motorists who drive hybrid cars produce just as much automotive air pollution as those who drive nonhybrids would undermine this argument.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If drivers of hybrid cars tend to drive more kilometers than drivers of nonhybrids, then they may consume just as much fuel and produce just as much air pollution as the nonhybrid car drivers do, despite their lower fuel use per kilometer.
Explanation B: B. The politician’s argument is only about air pollution from cars specifically, not air pollution from all sources.
Explanation C: C. Even if hybrid cars are beginning to gain popularity, informing motorists of the cost savings from fuel efficiency could help these cars become more popular than they would otherwise be.
Explanation D: D. Encouraging motorists to switch to hybrid cars now could reduce fuel use and automotive air pollution in the near future even if other, more fuel-efficient vehicles will become available further in the future.
Explanation E: E. Even if the future cost of fuel cannot be predicted accurately, encouraging motorists to switch to hybrid cars could reduce air pollution as the politician argues.

### Context:
Mayor: False alarms from home security systems waste so much valuable police time that in many communities, police have stopped responding to alarms from homes whose systems frequently produce false alarms. This policy reduces wastage of police time but results in a loss of protection for some residents. To achieve a comparable reduction in wastage without reducing protection for residents, the council has enacted a measure to fine residents for repeated false alarms. Which of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on whether the measure enacted by the

### Question:
council will achieve its goal?
A: A. A fine in the amount planned by the council will not cover the expenses police typically incur when they respond to a false alarm.
B: B. Homes equipped with security systems are far less likely to be broken into than are homes without security systems.
C: C. The threat of fines is likely to cause many residents to deactivate their security systems.
D: D. The number of home security systems is likely to increase dramatically over the next five years.
E: E. Many home security systems have never produced false alarms. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 In many communities, police have been responding to false home-security alarms but have ceased to respond to alarms from homes that often have such false alarms. To reduce wastage of police time without compromising residents’ home protection, one town council has enacted a new measure that will fine home residents for repeated false alarms.
### Reasoning: 
 What fact or occurrence would most reduce the likelihood that the town council’s newly enacted measure would achieve its goal, which is to reduce wastage of police time without compromising home protection? Note that the goal is not to eliminate all wastage of police time or to pay all the costs of it; some random wastage is to be expected. But if many residents deactivated their security alarms (even well-functioning systems) because they wish to avoid being fined, this could reduce the level of home protection for those residents.
Explanation A: A. The goal is to reduce wastage of police time resulting from false security-system alarms, not necessarily to cover all the costs in police time for such alarms.
Explanation B: B. This seems obviously true, but it is also irrelevant to the frequency of false home-security alarms. It is therefore irrelevant, also, to whether the council’s measure will effectively address wastage of police time stemming from such alarms.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If this occurred, it would result in a lower level of home protection for some residents and would mean that the town council’s measure would have failed to achieve its goal.
Explanation D: D. This scenario does not make the council’s measure more likely to fail to achieve its goal. If the increase in alarm systems occurs, it will likely result in more protection for the homes of more residents. Assuming vigorous enforcement of the new measure, we have no reason to believe that the number of false alarms would increase.
Explanation E: E. This has little bearing on the likelihood of the council’s measure succeeding. Any home security system that has never produced a false alarm could do so tomorrow, for all kinds of reasons.

### Context:
Excavation of the house of a third-century Camarnian official revealed that he had served four magistrates—public officials who administer the law—over his thirty-year public career, in four provincial capital cities. However, given the Camarnian administrative system of that era, it is unclear whether he served them simultaneously, as a traveling administrator living for part of the year in each provincial capital, or else did so sequentially, leaving one magistrate after several years to join another. Which of the following would, if found in the excavation, most likely help reveal the pattern of

### Question:
the official’s administrative service?
A: A. Maps and documents describing each of the four provincial capitals
B: B. A cache of the official’s documents related to work from early in his career
C: C. A set of cups of a type made only in the city of the first magistrate whom the official is known to have served
D: D. Several pieces of furniture in the styles of two of the provincial capital cities
E: E. Heavy clothing appropriate only for the coldest of the four cities Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Evidence from an excavation makes clear that a particular third-century Camarnian official served four magistrates in four provincial capitals over his thirty-year career, but it is unclear whether he served the magistrates simultaneously or sequentially.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence, if it were also found in the excavation, would be most helpful in determining whether the official served the magistrates simultaneously or sequentially? It would be helpful to find documents from throughout the magistrate’s career indicating at what times he worked for each magistrate, or even documents from just one period, as long as there were a large number, because this would likely show whether he was working for just one magistrate or for all four.
Explanation A: A. We already know that the official worked in each of the four capitals. The fact that maps and documents describing the capitals were at his house tells us nothing about whether he worked for magistrates in these capitals simultaneously or not.
Explanation B: B. Correct. Presumably, the work-related documents would show whom he was working for at the time, and for how long—and would provide evidence as to whether he was working for multiple magistrates or for just one.
Explanation C: C. Merely finding a set of cups made only in one of the cities tells us little. Even if we knew when he acquired the set, he need not have been working for the magistrate of that city at the time he acquired it; perhaps he had simply traveled to that city.
Explanation D: D. One frequently moves furniture when moving from one city to another, so the fact that the official had pieces of furniture that may have come from different cities does not give us any indication of whether the official worked for all four magistrates simultaneously or not.
Explanation E: E. The fact that heavy clothing appropriate only for the coldest of the four cities was found in the excavation of the official’s house does not imply that other clothing, appropriate for one or more of the other cities, was not found. Consistent with the finding of the heavy clothing, the official may have worked exclusively in the city for which that clothing was appropriate, or worked intermittently in this city.

### Context:
In 1563, in Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio, Giorgio Vasari built in front of an existing wall a new wall on which he painted a mural. Investigators recently discovered a gap between Vasari’s wall and the original, large enough to have preserved anything painted on the original. Historians believe that Leonardo da Vinci had painted, but left unfinished, a mural on the original wall; some historians had also believed that by 1563, the mural had been destroyed. However, it is known that in the late 1560s, when renovating another building, Santa Maria Novella, Vasari built a façade over its frescoes, and the frescoes were thereby preserved. Thus, Leonardo’s Palazzo Vecchio mural probably still exists behind Vasari’s wall.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A: A. Leonardo rarely if ever destroyed artworks that he left unfinished.
B: B. Vasari was likely unaware that the mural in the Palazzo Vecchio had willingly been abandoned by Leonardo.
C: C. Vasari probably would not have built the Palazzo Vecchio wall with a gap behind it except to preserve something behind the new wall.
D: D. Leonardo would probably have completed the Palazzo Vecchio mural if he had had the opportunity to do so.
E: E. When Vasari preserved the frescoes of Santa Maria Novella he did so secretly. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Georgio Vasari built a new wall in front of an existing wall in the Palazzo Vecchio that historians believe had had an unfinished mural by Leonardo da Vinci painted on it. Some historians, however, believe the mural had been destroyed by the time Vasari built the new wall. There is a gap between the old and new wall, large enough to have preserved anything painted on it, as there is in Santa Maria Novella, where Vasari also constructed a new wall in front of an old wall; on that wall, the building’s frescoes were preserved.
### Reasoning: 
 What claim needs to be true for the cited facts to support the conclusion that Leonardo’s Palazzo Vecchio mural likely still exists behind Vasari’s wall? If there are other equally likely reasons that Vasari would have left a gap between the old wall and a new wall, besides preserving any painting on the old wall, the stated facts would not support the conclusion. After all, it may be only fortuitous that the frescoes in the Santa Maria Novella were preserved when Vasari built the new wall with a gap between it and the old wall. Therefore, the argument depends on assuming that it is unlikely that Vasari would have created a gap between the old and new walls unless he had been trying to preserve something painted on the old wall.
Explanation A: A. The argument does not depend on the claim that Leonardo rarely if ever destroyed his unfinished artworks. Obviously, it does depend on the claim that he did not always do so, but even if he fairly regularly destroyed unfinished artworks, this mural could be one of the ones he did not—perhaps the reason the mural was left unfinished was that he died before completing it.
Explanation B: B. The argument does not depend on Vasari knowing that Leonardo had willingly abandoned the mural. Even if Leonardo did willingly leave it unfinished, Vasari could nonetheless have thought the mural was of value and wanted to preserve it.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If there had been other likely reasons for Vasari to have built a gap behind the new wall other than to preserve something painted on the old wall, the cited facts would not be a good reason to believe that Vasari built the gap for the purpose of preserving anything painted on it.
Explanation D: D. Leonardo may have had no interest in finishing the mural. Vasari could nevertheless have thought that there was value in preserving it.
Explanation E: E. There is no need to assume that Vasari preserved the frescoes at Santa Maria Novella secretly. Even if he did not do so in this instance, he could have preserved other paintings secretly by the same means, or he may have let others know that he was preserving Leonardo’s mural, although there is no historical record that he did let them know.

### Context:
Coffee shop owner: A large number of customers will pay at least the fair market value for a cup of coffee, even if there is no formal charge. Some will pay more than this out of appreciation of the trust that is placed in them. And our total number of customers is likely to increase. We could therefore improve our net cash flow by implementing an honor system in which customers pay what they wish for coffee by depositing money in a can. Manager: We’re likely to lose money on this plan. Many customers would cheat the system, paying a very small sum or nothing at all. Which of the following, if true, would best support the owner’s plan, in light of the manager’s

### Question:
concern?
A: A. The new system, if implemented, would increase the number of customers.
B: B. By roasting its own coffee, the shop has managed to reduce the difficulties (and cost) of maintaining an inventory of freshly roasted coffee.
C: C. Many customers stay in the cafe for long stretches of time.
D: D. The shop makes a substantial profit from pastries and other food bought by the coffee drinkers.
E: E. No other coffee shop in the area has such a system. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The owner and the manager of a coffee shop disagree about whether allowing customers to pay for coffee on an honor system would increase or decrease profits.
### Reasoning: 
 What would be the best evidence that the honor-system plan would increase profits even if many customers cheated the system? The owner argues that profits would increase because many customers will choose to pay as much or more than before and the total number of customers will likely increase. But the manager points out that many customers would also choose to pay little or nothing. Assuming that the manager is correct about that, what further support could the owner present for the claim that the plan would still be profitable?
Explanation A: A. Since the owner has already basically asserted this, asserting it again would not provide any significant additional support for the plan.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that the shop is already profitable, not that the honor-system plan would make it more profitable.
Explanation C: C. Customers who stay in the cafe for long stretches would not necessarily pay any more per cup on the honor-system plan than other customers would.
Explanation D: D. Correct. If the customer base increases (as both the owner and the manager seem to agree), more customers will likely purchase highly profitable pastries and other foods, thus boosting profits.
Explanation E: E. The reason no other coffee shop in the area has an honor system may be that their owners and managers have determined that it would not be profitable.

### Context:
Birds have been said to be descended from certain birdlike dinosaur species with which they share distinctive structural features. The fossil record, however, shows that this cannot be so, since there are bird fossils that are much older than the earliest birdlike dinosaur fossils that have been found.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies?
A: A. The birdlike dinosaurs have no living descendants.
B: B. There are no flightless dinosaur species that have the distinctive structural features shared by birds and birdlike dinosaurs.
C: C. There are no birdlike dinosaur fossils that are older than the bird fossils but have not yet been unearthed.
D: D. It could not have been the case that some birds were descended from one of the birdlike dinosaur species and other birds from another.
E: E. Birds cannot have been descended from dinosaur species with which the birds do not share the distinctive structural features. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Although birds have been said to be descended from birdlike dinosaurs, some bird fossils predate the earliest known birdlike dinosaur fossils.
### Reasoning: 
reasoning assumes that any birdlike dinosaurs that lived before the first birds would have left fossils that still exist. It also assumes that no undiscovered birdlike dinosaur fossils predate the cited bird fossils.
Explanation A: A. The argument is only about whether birds are descended from birdlike dinosaurs. Whether birdlike dinosaurs have any living descendants other than birds is irrelevant.
Explanation B: B. The argument is only about birds and birdlike dinosaurs. It is not about other types of dinosaurs that were not birdlike.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If any undiscovered birdlike dinosaur fossils predate the cited bird fossils, then the latter fossils’ age does not support the conclusion that birds are not descended from birdlike dinosaurs.
Explanation D: D. The argument purports to establish that the relative ages of bird fossils and birdlike dinosaur fossils show that birds cannot be descended from any of the known birdlike dinosaur species. In doing this, it acknowledges multiple birdlike dinosaur species and leaves open the question of whether some birds may be descended from one such species and other birds from another such species.
Explanation E: E. The argument does not claim that the known fossil record shows that birds cannot be descended from dinosaurs. It only claims that the record shows that they cannot be descended from the birdlike dinosaurs that shared their distinctive structural features.

### Context:
City council member: Demand for electricity has been increasing by 1 5 percent a year, and there simply is no more space to build additional power plants to meet future demand increases. We must therefore begin to curtail usage, which is why I propose passing ordinances requiring energy-conservation measures in all city departments.

### Question:
The city council member’s proposal assumes which of the following?
A: A. Existing power plants do not have the capacity to handle all of the projected increase in demand for electricity.
B: B. No city departments have implemented energy-conservation measures voluntarily.
C: C. Passing ordinances designed to curtail electricity usage will not have negative economic consequences for the city.
D: D. Residential consumers are not responsible for the recent increases in demand for electricity.
E: E. City departments that successfully conserve energy will set a good example for residential and industrial consumers of electricity. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A city council member proposes energy-conservation measures for all city government departments because there is no room to build new power plants to meet future increases in the demand for electricity.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true in order for the factors the city council member cites to help justify the proposal? The city council member says electricity usage must be curtailed on account of an increasing demand for electricity and a lack of space for new power plants that could meet future demand increases. In order for this reasoning to help justify the proposal, the cited factors must actually establish a need to curtail electricity usage.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If current power plants could satisfy the projected increased demand for electricity, then the increasing demand and the lack of room to build new plants would not establish a need to curtail electricity usage.
Explanation B: B. The proposed ordinances could still be necessary even if one city department had voluntarily implemented energy-conservation measures.
Explanation C: C. Passing the ordinances could still be necessary even if they would have some negative economic effects.
Explanation D: D. No matter who is responsible for the recent increases in demand, curtailing the city government’s electricity usage could still help to reduce demand.
Explanation E: E. Ordinances to curtail the city government’s energy usage could be economically necessary regardless of whether or not departments that obey the ordinances set a good example.

### Context:
Certain groups of Asian snails include both “left-handed” and “right-handed” species, with shells coiling to the left and right, respectively. Some left-handed species have evolved from right-handed ones. Also, researchers found that snail-eating snakes in the same habitat have asymmetrical jaws, allowing them to grasp right-handed snail shells more easily. If these snakes ate more right-handed snails over time, this would have given left-handed snails an evolutionary advantage over right-handed snails, with the left-handed snails eventually becoming a new species. Thus, the snakes’ asymmetrical jaws probably helped drive the emergence of the left-handed snail species. Which of the following would, if true, most strengthen the argument that asymmetrical snake

### Question:
jaws helped drive left-handed snail evolution?
A: A. In one snake species, the snakes with asymmetrical jaws eat snails, while the snakes with symmetrical jaws do not eat snails.
B: B. Some species of Asian snails contain either all right-handed snails, or all left-handed snails.
C: C. Anatomical differences prevent left-handed snails from mating easily with right-handed snails.
D: D. Some right-handed snails in this habitat have shells with a very narrow opening that helps prevent snakes from extracting the snails from inside their shells.
E: E. Experiments show that the snail-eating snakes in this habitat fail more often in trying to eat left-handed snails than in trying to eat right-handed snails. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 There are both Asian snails with shells that coil to the right and Asian snails with shells that coil to the left, and the latter have evolved from the former; furthermore, there are snakes that have asymmetrical jaws that allow the snakes to grasp the snails with right-coiled shells more easily.
### Reasoning: 
 What fact would help support the claim that the snakes’ asymmetrical jaws helped drive the emergence of species of snails with left-coiled shells? We are told that if over time the snakes with asymmetrical jaws ate more snails with right-coiled shells than snails with left-coiled shells, then this would give snails with left- coiled shells an evolutionary survival advantage. So, if some evidence showed that the snakes with such jaws in fact were more likely to have successfully eaten the snails with the right-coiled shells, then we would have good reason to think the snakes’ asymmetrical jaws helped drive the emergence of snails with left-coiled shells.
Explanation A: A. The fact that snakes with asymmetrical jaws eat snails and other snakes do not does not give any indication as to whether snails with left-coiled shells have any evolutionary advantages over snails with right-coiled shells. At best it only tells us that if snakes drove the evolution of snails with left-coiled shells, it would likely have been the snakes with asymmetrical jaws.
Explanation B: B. The fact that some species of Asian snails have no variation in the direction in which their shells coil tells us nothing about what, if any, evolutionary advantages they have relative to other snails, or whether the snakes’ asymmetrical jaws had any effect on any such evolutionary advantages.
Explanation C: C. The inability of snails with left-coiled shells to mate easily with snails with right-coiled shells in and of itself tells us nothing about whether the snakes’ asymmetrical jaws had any effect on the emergence of snails with left-coiled shells. Although it does suggest a different factor that could have contributed to the emergence of the snail species with left-coiled shells, it does not exclude the possibility that the snakes were also a factor.
Explanation D: D. The fact that snakes cannot extract some snails with right-coiled shells from their shells would suggest that these snails might have an evolutionary advantage, but the argument’s conclusion is about an evolutionary advantage that snails with left-coiled shells presumably have, not an advantage that snails with right-coiled shells would have.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The fact that experiments show that the snakes are more successful at eating snails with right-coiled shells than they are at eating snails with left-coiled shells would support the claim that these snakes did in fact eat more snails with right-coiled shells, and hence the snails with left-coiled shells would as a result have an evolutionary advantage.

### Response:

### Situation: 
 A moderately large city desires to attract more workers and shoppers to downtown businesses by making the downtown area more pleasant and easier to travel to. In light of this goal, the city is considering a plan that would reduce the number of lanes for automobiles and trucks and increase those for bicycles and pedestrians.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most strongly support the prediction that reducing the number of lanes for automobiles and trucks and increasing those for bicycles and pedestrians would achieve the goal of attracting more people to downtown businesses? If other moderately sized cities that have improved the accessibility of their downtown areas to pedestrians and cyclists have seen increased downtown business, then it is reasonable to think that the city in question will have improved downtown business as well.
Explanation A: A. If people who make a habit of walking or bicycling derive significant health benefits from doing so, that would provide further motivation for trying to encourage people to walk or ride a bicycle, but it does not provide much support for the claim that adding lanes for pedestrians and cyclists will successfully bring people to shop or work more in the city’s downtown. Perhaps people will merely use the new lanes for exercise but not to get to the downtown area to do business.
Explanation B: B. Because the plan as described does not provide for additional parking, the fact that parking is a major concern motivating people to shop at suburban malls does not give us good reason to think that the city’s plan will help achieve the city’s goal.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If other moderately sized cities that have made their downtown areas more accessible to pedestrians and cyclists have seen their downtown businesses begin to thrive soon afterward, this is evidence—even if not conclusive—that the changes produced the thriving. Consequently, it is reasonable to think that the same will result for the city in question.
Explanation D: D. It might be the case that rigorously enforcing lane restrictions will attract more people to downtown businesses than would otherwise be the case, but the information provided does not indicate how strictly lane restrictions will be enforced.
Explanation E: E. The city’s plan is aimed at increasing the use of bicycles for the purposes of shopping or getting to work, not only for recreational purposes. And even if people who use their bicycles for recreational purposes would also be likely to use them for shopping or getting to work, the fact that most recreational cyclists live at a significant distance from the city’s downtown area may suggest that the city’s plan will not be successful, because the cyclists may live too far away to use their bicycles for these purposes, even if it would be somewhat easier for them to do so once the plan has been implemented.

### Context:
Previously, Autoco designed all of its cars itself and then contracted with specialized parts suppliers to build parts according to its specifications. Now it plans to include its suppliers in designing the parts they are to build. Since many parts suppliers have more designers with specialized experience than Autoco has, Autoco expects this shift to reduce the overall time and cost of the design of its next new car.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports Autoco’s expectation?
A: A. When suppliers provide their own designs, Autoco often needs to modify its overall design.
B: B. In order to provide designs for Autoco, several of the parts suppliers will have to add to their existing staffs of designers.

E: E. Most of Autoco’s suppliers have on hand a wide range of previously prepared parts designs that can readily be modified for a new car. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A car manufacturer plans to have its parts suppliers start helping to design the parts they build for the manufacturer. Many parts suppliers have more designers with specialized experience than the manufacturer has.
### Reasoning: 
 What would make it more likely that having the parts suppliers help design the parts will reduce the time and cost of designing the manufacturer’s next new car? In order for the change to reduce the time and cost, the parts suppliers involved in designing the next car will probably have to do their portion of the design process faster and cheaper than the manufacturer would have, and the design collaboration process will have to avoid producing substantial new inefficiencies.
Explanation A: A. The additional need to modify the overall design would probably make the design process slower and more expensive, not faster and cheaper.
Explanation B: B. The additional need to hire more designers would probably increase design costs, not reduce them.
Explanation C: C. Although this suggests that the change is likely to substantially affect the design’s expense, it does not indicate whether the expense will increase or decrease.
Explanation D: D. If anything, this competition probably made Autoco’s previous design process cheaper. It does not suggest that the new design process, which may involve less competition, will be faster or cheaper than the previous one.
Explanation E: E. Correct. Modifying the previously prepared parts designs will probably be faster and cheaper than creating new designs from scratch.

### Context:
In response to viral infection, the immune systems of mice typically produce antibodies that destroy the virus by binding to proteins on its surface. Mice infected with the herpesvirus generally develop keratitis, a degenerative disease affecting part of the eye. Since proteins on the surface of cells in this part of the eye closely resemble those on the herpesvirus surface, scientists hypothesize that these cases of keratitis are caused by antibodies to the herpesvirus.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most helps to support the scientists’ reasoning?
A: A. Other types of viruses have surface proteins that closely resemble proteins found in various organs of mice.
B: B. Mice that are infected with the herpesvirus but do not develop keratitis produce as many antibodies as infected mice that do develop keratitis.
C: C. Mice infected with a new strain of the herpesvirus that has different surface proteins did not develop keratitis.
D: D. Mice that have never been infected with the herpesvirus can sometimes develop keratitis.
E: E. There are mice that are unable to form antibodies in response to herpes infections, and these mice contract herpes at roughly the same rate as other mice. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Mice infected with the herpesvirus tend to develop keratitis, an eye disease. The surface of the eye cells has proteins that resemble those on the herpesvirus surface. Based on this finding, scientists have hypothesized that keratitis develops in mice because antibodies that attack herpesvirus surface proteins can also attack eyes.
### Reasoning: 
 What other information, if correct, would provide the strongest support for the scientists’ hypothesis? The clue that led the scientists to form their hypothesis was the close resemblance of the proteins on the mouse eye surface to those on the herpesvirus surface. The resemblance could cause antibodies to bind to both types of proteins, in one case eliminating the herpesvirus and in the other case causing keratitis.
Explanation A: A. Even if this is correct, we lack information as to whether the antibodies to those other types of virus can damage the organs that display the closely resembling proteins. If such a damage process were confirmed, it could count as evidence—even if not sufficient—to confirm the scientists’ hypothesis.
Explanation B: B. If anything, this would, absent further information, raise doubts about the correctness of the scientists’ proposed explanation.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This provides strong confirmation of the scientists’ hypothesis. The proteins on the new strain of the herpesvirus no longer sufficiently resemble the proteins on the eye surface to cause the antibodies to attack those proteins and cause keratitis.
Explanation D: D. For all we know, keratitis may have multiple independent causes and may sometimes be caused by processes other than the protein misidentification hypothesized by the scientists. This information neither confirms nor refutes the scientists’ hypothesis.
Explanation E: E. The rates at which mice contract herpes is not discussed. We lack any information as to whether mice that lack antibodies to the herpesvirus sometimes contract keratitis along with herpes infection.

### Context:
One might expect that within a particular species, any individuals that managed to slow down the aging process would leave more offspring. Natural selection should therefore favor extreme longevity—but this does not seem to be the case. A possible explanation is that aging is a product of the inevitable wear and tear of living, similar to how household appliances generally accumulate faults that lead to their eventual demise. However, most researchers do not find this analogy satisfactory as an explanation. Which of the following would, if true, provide the strongest explanation for the researchers’

### Question:
reaction?
A: A. Some organisms are capable of living much longer than other organisms.
B: B. Some organisms reproduce very quickly despite having short lifespans.
C: C. There are several ways of defining “extreme longevity,” and according to some definitions it occurs frequently.
D: D. Organisms are capable of maintenance and self-repair and can remedy much of the damage that they accumulate.
E: E. Some organisms generate much more wear and tear on their bodies than others. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 One possible explanation for the fact that natural selection does not favor extreme longevity, despite the fact that a slowed-down aging process would leave more offspring, is that aging is the product of wear and tear, much like how household appliances eventually no longer function because of wear and tear; most researchers, however, reject this analogy as an explanation.
### Reasoning: 
 What would explain the researchers’ rejection of the explanation? The explanation is based on analogy between organisms and household appliances. If there were a crucial difference between appliances and organisms, such as the fact that organisms are capable of self-repair in a way that household appliances are not, then it would be reasonable for the researchers to reject the explanation.
Explanation A: A. The fact that some organisms can live much longer than other organisms is not a good reason to reject the analogy; after all, some household appliances may last much longer than others, perhaps because they receive a different amount of wear and tear.
Explanation B: B. Even if some organisms reproduce very quickly despite having short lifespans, that does not mean that they would not have even more offspring if they lived longer; also, this is irrelevant as to whether the analogy between the aging process and the wear and tear on household appliances is any good.
Explanation C: C. It is unclear what these different ways of defining “extreme longevity” are—perhaps the definition is merely a relative one; some organisms live much longer than others, and those that do have “extreme longevity.” But presumably, some household appliances last much longer than others, so this would not indicate a difference, and thus would not explain why most researchers reject the analogy.
Explanation D: D. Correct. Household appliances cannot repair themselves as organisms can, so the wear and tear of living is quite different from the wear and tear in household appliances.
Explanation E: E. Presumably, some household appliances receive much more wear and tear than other household appliances, so the fact that some organisms generate more wear and tear on their bodies than others does not indicate a difference between appliances and organisms, and thus does not explain why the researchers reject the analogy.

### Context:
Last year a record number of new manufacturing jobs were created  Will this year bring another record? Well, any new manufacturing job is created either within an existing company or by the start-up of a new company. Within existing firms, new jobs have been created this year at well below last year’s record pace. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that the number of new companies starting up this year will be no higher than it was last year, and there is no reason to think that the new companies starting up this year will create more jobs per company than did last year’s start-ups. So clearly, the number of new jobs created this year will fall short of last year’s record.

### Question:
In the argument given, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first provides evidence in support of the main conclusion of the argument; the second is a claim that the argument challenges.

### Response:

### Situation: 
 Manufacturing jobs are created either within existing companies or in start- ups. Manufacturing jobs are being created at a much slower rate this year than last year. It seems likely that the number of new start-ups will not exceed last year’s number and that the average number of manufacturing jobs per start- up will not exceed last year’s number. So, fewer manufacturing jobs are likely to be created this year than last year.

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Manufacturing jobs are created either within existing companies or in start- ups. Manufacturing jobs at existing firms are being created at a much slower rate this year than last year. It seems likely that the number of new start-ups will not exceed last year’s number and that the average number of new manufacturing jobs per start-up will not exceed last year’s number. So, fewer manufacturing jobs are likely to be created this year than last year.
### Reasoning: 
 What function is served by the statement that any new manufacturing job is created either within an existing company or by the start-up of a new company? What function is served by the statement that the number of new jobs created this year will fall short of last year’s record number? The first statement makes explicit a general background assumption that manufacturing jobs are created in just two ways. This assumption is used, along with other information, to support the argument’s main conclusion. The second statement gives the argument’s main conclusion, a prediction about how this year’s manufacturing-job creation will compare with last year’s.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The first statement expresses a truism: assuming that all manufacturing jobs are created by companies, it is obviously true that all such jobs are created either by companies that already existed or by new companies that did not exist before. The argument then goes on to claim that new-job creation in each of these categories in the current year will be less than in the previous year. Since these two categories are exhaustive (as indicated in the first boldfaced portion), the argument concludes that new-job creation in the current year will be less than in the previous year. This is the argument’s main conclusion (expressed in the second boldfaced portion).
Explanation B: B. The second statement is the argument’s main conclusion, not an intermediate conclusion used to support the argument’s main conclusion.
Explanation C: C. The second statement is the main conclusion of the argument, not a statement used as support for the main conclusion.
Explanation D: D. The argument merely asserts, and does not “seek to establish,” the first statement. The first statement is a truism that does not need to be supported with evidence.
Explanation E: E. The second statement is the argument’s main conclusion and is not meant to present a challenge to the first statement. The first statement serves to provide partial support for the argument’s main conclusion.

### Context:
In Stenland, many workers have been complaining that they cannot survive on minimum wage, the lowest wage an employer is permitted to pay. The government is proposing to raise the minimum wage.

Which of the following, if true in Stenland, most strongly supports the claim that raising the

### Question:

A: A. For any position with wages below a living wage, the difficulty of finding and retaining employees adds as much to employment costs as would raising wages.
B: B. Raising the minimum wage does not also increase the amount employers have to contribute in employee benefits.
C: C. When inflation is taken into account, the proposed new minimum wage is not as high as the current one was when it was introduced.
D: D. Many employees currently being paid wages at the level of the proposed new minimum wage will demand significant wage increases.
E: E. Many employers who pay some workers only the minimum wage also pay other workers wages that are much higher than the minimum. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Stenland’s government proposes to raise the minimum wage because many workers have complained they cannot survive on it. But many employers claim that raising the minimum wage will increase unemployment.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence would most strongly suggest that raising the minimum wage will not increase unemployment? The employers with minimum-wage workers implicitly reason that because raising the minimum wage will increase the wages they have to pay each worker, it will reduce the number of workers they can afford to employ, and thus will increase unemployment. Evidence that the increased wage would not actually increase the employers’ expenses per employee would cast doubt on their prediction, as would evidence that reducing the number of minimum-wage workers would not increase the nation’s overall unemployment rate.
Explanation A: A. Correct. This suggests that raising the minimum wage would make it easier for employers to find and retain minimum-wage employees, and that the savings would fully offset the cost of paying the higher wages. If there were such offsetting savings, the employers should still be able to afford to employ as many workers as they currently do.
Explanation B: B. Even if raising the minimum wage does not increase employers’ costs for employee benefits, paying the higher wage might still in itself substantially increase employers’ overall costs per employee.
Explanation C: C. For all we know, the current minimum wage might have substantially increased unemployment when it was introduced.
Explanation D: D. These additional demands would probably raise employers’ overall costs per employee, making it more likely that increasing the minimum wage would increase overall unemployment.
Explanation E: E. Even if some workers receive more than the minimum wage, raising that wage could still raise employers’ expenses for employing low-wage workers, making it too expensive for the employers to employ as many workers overall.

### Context:
Biologists with a predilection for theory have tried—and largely failed—to define what it is that makes something a living thing. Organisms take in energy-providing materials and excrete waste products, but so do automobiles. Living things replicate and take part in evolution, but so do some computer programs. We must be open to the possibility that there are living things on other planets. Therefore, we will not be successful in defining what it is that makes something a living thing merely by examining living things on Earth—the only ones we know. Trying to do so is analogous to trying to specify _______.

E: E. what a mammal is by examining a zebra Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Some biologists have tried, unsuccessfully, to find a theoretically defensible account of what it means for something to be a living thing. Some of the suggested definitions are too broad because they include things that we would not regard as living. To find life on other planets, we must not narrow our conception of life by basing it simply on the kinds of life encountered on Earth.
### Reasoning: 
 Which of the answer choices would be the logically most appropriate completion of the argument? The argument points out that life-forms elsewhere in the universe may be very different from any of the life-forms on Earth. Both life- forms on Earth and life-forms discovered elsewhere would all qualify as members of a very large class, the class of all life-forms. Taking life-forms on Earth, a mere subset of the class of all life-forms, as representative of all life- forms would be a logical mistake and might not lead to success in defining what it means for something to be a living thing. The correct answer choice, therefore, would involve a case of specifying what some general class of things is by examining the members of only a small, and not necessarily representative, subset of that class of things. In other words, the correct answer choice will involve the logical mistake of taking a subset as representative of a larger class.
Explanation A: A. Pure mathematics is not a subset of the law of physics, so this does not involve the logical mistake of taking a subset as representative of a larger class.
Explanation B: B. The chemical components of a fish are what make up the fish; they are not a small subset of the fish, so this does not involve the logical mistake of taking a subset as representative of a larger class.
Explanation C: C. Plants are not a subset of the class of animals, so this does not involve the logical mistake of taking a subset as representative of a larger class.
Explanation D: D. A sketch of a machine is not a subclass of the machine itself, so this does not involve the logical mistake of taking a subset as representative of a larger class.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This involves the logical mistake of taking the class of zebras, a subclass of the class of mammals, as representative of the class of all mammals. Logically, it resembles taking the class of life-forms on Earth as representative of the class of all life-forms.

It is unclear whether the village was actually a part of Kingdom F in the ninth century or whether it was a part of Kingdom G but had merely adopted Kingdom F’s artistic styles under Kingdom F’s cultural influence. Which of the following would, if found in ninth-century sites in the village, best help in

D: D. Some fragments of pottery made in the Kingdom G style from the seventh century out of materials only found in Kingdom F
E: E. Numerous teeth from the ninth century with a chemical signature typical only of teeth from people who had grown up in the heart of Kingdom F Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 From the eighth century to the eleventh century, the boundaries between two kingdoms, F and G, shifted, but these shifts are not well documented. A certain village in a border region was usually part of Kingdom G, but ninth-century artifacts in the village are typical of the style of ninth-century artifacts from Kingdom F.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence, if it were found in the ninth-century sites in the village, would be most helpful in determining which of the two kingdoms the village was a part of during that century? Information strongly indicating that during the ninth century the village was primarily settled by people clearly from Kingdom F would lend support to the claim that the village was part of Kingdom F in the ninth century.
Explanation A: A. A trading contract found at a ninth-century site in the village written in Kingdom G dialect would not settle whether the village was part of Kingdom G, because it could be the case that such a document would be written in that dialect even if the village were part of Kingdom F but regularly traded with Kingdom G.
Explanation B: B. Finding at a ninth-century site in the village a drawing of a dwelling complex known to have been on the border of Kingdom F and Kingdom G would not be useful in determining to which kingdom the village belonged at the time. We are not told in which kingdom that dwelling complex existed, and even if we were told, it could be that a villager in the other kingdom had a drawing of that complex for some reason (e.g., the villager could have had it because that complex was going to be attacked in a skirmish between the kingdoms).
Explanation C: C. Because there could have been trade between Kingdom F and Kingdom G, the fact that utensils made from metal typical of ninth-century mining sites in Kingdom F would not be very helpful in determining to which of the two kingdoms the village belonged in that century.
Explanation D: D. If fragments of pottery from the seventh century made in the Kingdom G style but from materials found only in Kingdom F were discovered, it would be unclear in which kingdom the pottery had been made. Given that the fragments may be from two centuries earlier than the period in question, and that we do not even know what kingdom the pottery was created in, these fragments would be of no use in determining to which kingdom the village belonged in the ninth century.
Explanation E: E. Correct. Although the mere presence of people from Kingdom F in the village would not provide strong support for the claim that the village was part of Kingdom F during the ninth century—the village could have shifted from Kingdom F to Kingdom G while maintaining much of its Kingdom F population—the presence of significant numbers of people from the heart of Kingdom F would support the claim that there was widespread migration of people from Kingdom F to the village. This is what one might reasonably expect if the village was part of Kingdom F during the ninth century. The discovery of numerous teeth that clearly belonged to people who grew up in the heart of Kingdom F in the ninth century would support the claim that many such people lived in the village during that century.

Sammy: For my arthritis, I am going to try my aunt’s diet: large amounts of wheat germ and garlic. She was able to move more easily right after she started that diet. Pat: When my brother began that diet, his arthritis got worse. But he has been doing much better since he stopped eating vegetables in the nightshade family, such as tomatoes and peppers.

### Question:
and Pat’s brother had contrasting experiences with the same diet?
A: A. A change in diet, regardless of the nature of the change, frequently brings temporary relief from arthritis symptoms.
B: B. The compounds in garlic that can lessen the symptoms of arthritis are also present in tomatoes and peppers.
C: C. Arthritis is a chronic condition whose symptoms improve and worsen from time to time without regard to diet.
D: D. In general, men are more likely to have their arthritis symptoms alleviated by avoiding vegetables in the nightshade family than are women.
E: E. People who are closely related are more likely to experience the same result from adopting a particular diet than are people who are unrelated. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Sammy’s aunt’s arthritis apparently improved after she consumed large amounts of wheat germ and garlic. Pat’s brother’s arthritis deteriorated after he followed the same diet. Since he stopped eating vegetables in the nightshade family, such as tomatoes and peppers, his arthritis has improved.
### Reasoning: 
 What could account for the fact that Sammy’s aunt’s arthritis improved and Pat’s brother’s arthritis got worse after they both followed the wheat germ and garlic diet? The fact that a person has a health improvement following a diet is, by itself, very weak evidence for the claim that the diet caused the improvement. More generally, the fact that one event follows another is seldom, by itself, evidence that the earlier event caused the later. This applies to both the experience of Sammy’s aunt and that of Pat’s brother with the wheat germ and garlic diet.
Explanation A: A. In theory, this could be somewhat relevant to Sammy’s aunt’s experience but not to Pat’s brother’s experience. It is, however, insufficient to explain either.
Explanation B: B. Even if this is true, it might be the case that a large quantity of the compounds in question must be consumed in concentrated form to benefit arthritis. No evidence is given to indicate whether this is so. Regardless, the puzzle as to why the wheat germ and garlic diet was followed by arthritis improvement in one case and not in the other remains.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If we know there are typically fluctuations in the severity of arthritis symptoms and these can occur independent of diet, then the divergent experiences of the two people can be attributed to such fluctuations—even if it is conceded that some diets can affect arthritis symptoms in some manner. The wheat germ and garlic diet may, or may not, be such a diet.
Explanation D: D. This could throw light on Pat’s brother’s experience but not on Sammy’s aunt’s experience.
Explanation E: E. If this is correct, it is still far too general to provide a basis for explaining why the experiences of the two people were different. Does it apply to arthritis? We’re not told. Nor are we told that it applies to the wheat germ and garlic diet. Is Pat’s brother closely related to Sammy’s aunt? We don’t know.

The author of the argument concludes from this information that the alligator population must have increased significantly during the 1990s.
### Reasoning: 
 What new piece of information would seriously weaken the argument? Increased sightings of alligators could occur either because there are more alligators or because more people are seeing the ones that are there. Any information indicating an increase in the ratio of people to alligators in locations where the two species coexist could offer an alternative to the hypothesis that the alligator population increased.
Explanation A: A. Correct. The argument suggests that Florida is an area in which golf courses and lawns are common. A large rapid increase in the human population of such an area would probably lead to a significant increase in the number of golf courses and lawns, some of which would encroach on the alligators’ habitats. Even without any increase in the overall number of alligators, this could lead to an increase in both the percentage of alligators that venture onto golf courses and lawns and the number of people who happen to be in such locations when alligators are present.
Explanation B: B. This information is peripheral to the issue we are being asked to address; it neither weakens nor strengthens the argument.
Explanation C: C. This information tends to strengthen, not weaken, the argument; it suggests that the frequency of reported sightings in other places was reliable and that the sightings indicated a surge in the alligator population.
Explanation D: D. To the extent that this is relevant, it could provide some weak support for the argument. Strictly regulating the sale of alligator products could deter alligator hunting by making it less profitable and could thus allow further increases in the alligator population.
Explanation E: E. Without further evidence, the net effect of this information cannot be reliably determined. On the one hand, if sightings is understood as elliptical for reports of seeing alligators, this could suggest that some of the reports may be dubious because they are not corroborated by additional observers. On the other hand, it suggests that the alligator population may in fact have increased. Times when few people are present are also times when wildlife such as alligators would be more likely to venture onto lawns and golf courses. Without any evidence that sightings before the 1990s did not typically occur in such conditions, this suggests that the number of alligators observable at those times increased in the 1990s.

You are a GMAT expert specializing in Critical Reasoning. Your task is to analyze the argument presented in the passage and answer the question that follows. Focus on identifying the premises, conclusion, assumptions, and logical fallacies in the argument. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Context:
Infotek, a computer manufacturer in Katrovia, has just introduced a new personal computer model that sells for significantly less than any other model. Market research shows, however, that very few Katrovian households without personal computers would buy a computer, regardless of its price. Therefore, introducing the new model is unlikely to increase the number of computers in Katrovian homes.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A: A. Infotek achieved the lower price of the new model by using components of lower quality than those used by other manufacturers.
B: B. The main reason cited by consumers in Katrovia for replacing a personal computer is the desire to have an improved model.
C: C. Katrovians in households that already have computers are unlikely to purchase the new Infotek model as an additional computer for home use.
D: D. The price of other personal computers in Katrovia is unlikely to drop below the price of Infotek’s new model in the near future.
E: E. Most personal computers purchased in Katrovia are intended for home use. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 In Katrovia, a new personal computer model costs less than any other model. But market research shows that very few Katrovian households without personal computers would buy even cheap ones.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true in order for the stated facts to support the conclusion that introducing the new computer model is unlikely to increase the overall number of computers in Katrovian homes? The market research supports the conclusion that no new computer model is likely to significantly increase the number of computers in Katrovian homes that currently lack computers. But the overall number of computers in Katrovian homes will still increase if Katrovian homes that already have computers buy additional computers while keeping their existing ones. So, the argument has to assume that the new computer model will not increase the number of additional computers purchased for Katrovian homes that already have computers.
Explanation A: A. Even if Infotek used high-quality components in the new computer model, Katrovians might still refuse to buy it.
Explanation B: B. Replacing a personal computer does not change the overall number of personal computers in homes, so Katrovians’ motives for replacing their computers are irrelevant to the argument.
Explanation C: C. Correct. As explained above, unless computers of the new model are purchased as additional computers for Katrovian homes that already have computers, the new model’s introduction is unlikely to increase the overall number of computers in Katrovian homes.
Explanation D: D. The assumption that other personal computer prices would stay relatively high does not help establish the link between its premises and its conclusion. If answer choice D were false, the argument would be no weaker than it is without any consideration of other computers’ potential prices.
Explanation E: E. If most personal computers purchased in Katrovia were not intended for home use, then the new model’s introduction would be even less likely to increase the number of personal computers in Katrovian homes. So, the argument does not depend on assuming that most of the computers purchased are for home use.

### Context:
Fast-food restaurants make up 45 percent of all restaurants in Canatria  Customers at these restaurants tend to be young; in fact, studies have shown that the older people get, the less likely they are to eat in fast-food restaurants. Since the average age of the Canatrian population is gradually rising and will continue to do so, the number of fast-food restaurants is likely to decrease.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A: A. Fast-food restaurants in Canatria are getting bigger, so each one can serve more customers.
B: B. Some older people eat at fast-food restaurants more frequently than the average young person.
C: C. Many people who rarely eat in fast-food restaurants nevertheless eat regularly in restaurants.
D: D. The overall population of Canatria is growing steadily.
E: E. As the population of Canatria gets older, more people are eating at home. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 In Canatria, the older people get, the less likely they are to eat in fast-food restaurants. The average age of Canatrians is increasing.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence would most weaken the support provided by the cited facts for the prediction that the number of fast-food restaurants in Canatria is likely to decrease? The argument implicitly reasons that since studies have shown that Canatrians tend to eat in fast-food restaurants less as they get older, and since Canatrians are getting older on average, the proportion of Canatrians eating in fast-food restaurants will decline. The argument assumes that this means the overall number of fast-food restaurant customers will decline and that demand will decrease enough to reduce the number of fast-food restaurants that can sustain profitability. Consequently, fewer new fast-food restaurants will open or more old ones will close, or both. Thus, the number of fast-food restaurants in Canatria will fall. Any evidence casting doubt on any inference in this chain of implicit reasoning will weaken the argument.
Explanation A: A. This strengthens the argument by providing additional evidence that the total number of fast-food restaurants will decrease. If the average number of customers per fast-food restaurant is increasing, then fewer fast-food restaurants will be needed to serve the same—or a lesser—number of customers.
Explanation B: B. Even if a few individuals do not follow the general trends described, those trends could still reduce the overall demand for and number of fast-food restaurants.
Explanation C: C. The argument is only about fast-food restaurants, not restaurants of other types.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This suggests that even if the proportion of Canatrians eating at fast-food restaurants declines, the total number doing so may not decline. Thus, the total demand for and profitability of fast-food restaurants may not decline either, so the total number of fast-food restaurants in Canatria may not decrease.
Explanation E: E. If anything, this strengthens the argument by pointing out an additional trend likely to reduce the demand for, and thus the number of, fast-food restaurants in Canatria.

### Context:
Last year a chain of fast-food restaurants, whose menu had always centered on hamburgers, added its first vegetarian sandwich, much lower in fat than the chain’s other offerings. Despite heavy marketing, the new sandwich accounts for a very small proportion of the chain’s sales. The sandwich’s sales would have to quadruple to cover the costs associated with including it on the menu. Since such an increase is unlikely, the chain would be more profitable if it dropped the sandwich.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A: A. Although many of the chain’s customers have never tried the vegetarian sandwich, in a market research survey, most of those who had tried it reported that they were very satisfied with it.
B: B. Many of the people who eat at the chain’s restaurants also eat at the restaurants of competing chains and report no strong preference among the competitors.
C: C. Among fast-food chains in general, there has been little or no growth in hamburger sales over the past several years as the range of competing offerings at other restaurants has grown.
D: D. When even one member of a group of diners is a vegetarian or has a preference for low- fat food, the group tends to avoid restaurants that lack vegetarian or low-fat menu options.
E: E. An attempt by the chain to introduce a lower-fat hamburger failed several years ago, since it attracted few new customers and most of the chain’s regular customers greatly preferred the taste of the regular hamburgers. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Last year a fast-food restaurant chain specializing in hamburgers started offering a low-fat vegetarian sandwich and marketed it heavily. The new sandwich’s sales are far too low to cover the costs associated with including it on the menu.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence would most weaken the support provided by the cited facts for the prediction that it would be more profitable for the chain to drop the sandwich? The implicit argument is that since the new sandwich’s sales are too low to cover the costs associated with including it on the menu, offering the sandwich diminishes the chain’s profitability and will continue to do so if the sandwich continues to be offered. This reasoning assumes that the sandwich provides the chain no substantial indirect financial benefits except through its direct sales. It also assumes that the sandwich’s sales will not increase sufficiently to make the sandwich a viable product. Any evidence casting doubt on either of these assumptions will weaken the argument.
Explanation A: A. This gives information only about the respondents to the survey who had tried the sandwich (possibly very few), who were probably already more open to liking a vegetarian sandwich than any of the chain’s other customers. So, their responses are probably unrepresentative of the chain’s customers in general and do not suggest that the sandwich has enough market potential.
Explanation B: B. Although the issue of competition with other restaurants is not raised in the information provided, this new information, if anything, strengthens the argument by suggesting that the introduction of the new sandwich has not significantly enhanced customer preference for eating at the restaurants that offer the new sandwich.
Explanation C: C. This suggests that the cause of stagnation in fast-food restaurants’ hamburger sales has been competition from non-fast-food restaurants, but not that the non-fast-food restaurants competed by offering vegetarian options.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This suggests that even if the sandwich’s sales are low, it may indirectly increase the chain’s overall profits by encouraging large groups to eat at the chain.
Explanation E: E. This strengthens the argument by suggesting that the chain’s customers are generally not interested in low-fat menu options such as the new sandwich.

### Context:
Transportation expenses accounted for a large portion of the total dollar amount spent on trips for pleasure by residents of the United States in 1997, and about half of the total dollar amount spent on transportation was for airfare. However, the large majority of United States residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997 did not travel by airplane but used other means of transportation. If the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true about United States

### Question:
residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997?
A: A. Most of those who traveled by airplane did so because the airfare to their destination was lower than the cost of other available means of transportation.
B: B. Most of those who traveled by airplane did so because other means of transportation to their destination were unavailable.
C: C. Per mile traveled, those who traveled by airplane tended to spend more on transportation to their destination than did those who used other means of transportation.
D: D. Overall, people who did not travel by airplane had lower average transportation expenses than people who did.
E: E. Those who traveled by airplane spent about as much, on average, on other means of transportation as they did on airfare. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 In 1997, about half of total transportation spending by U.S. residents taking trips for pleasure was for airfare. But the large majority of U.S. residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997 did not travel by airplane.
### Reasoning: 
 What can be deduced from the stated facts? The information provided indicates that among U.S. residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997, those who traveled by airplane were a small minority. Yet this small minority’s spending for airfare accounted for half of all transportation spending among residents taking trips for pleasure. It follows that on average, those who traveled by airplane must have spent far more per person on transportation than those who did not travel by airplane.
Explanation A: A. This does not follow logically from the information given. Most of those who traveled by airplane may have done so even if flying was more expensive than other modes of transportation—for example, because flying was faster or more comfortable.
Explanation B: B. This does not follow from the information given. Most of those who traveled by airplane may have done so even if many other modes of transportation were available—the other modes may all have been less desirable.
Explanation C: C. This does not follow from the information given. Those who traveled by airplane may have traveled much farther on average than those who used other means of transportation, so their transportation spending per mile traveled need not have been greater.
Explanation D: D. Correct. As explained above, those who traveled by airplane must have spent more per person on transportation than those who did not travel by airplane, on average. In other words, those who did not travel by airplane must have had lower average transportation expenses than those who did.
Explanation E: E. This does not follow from the information given. Although half the total dollar spending on transportation was for airfare, much of the transportation spending that was not for airfare was by the large majority of U.S. residents who did not travel by airplane.

### Context:
Voters commonly condemn politicians for being insincere, but politicians often must disguise their true feelings when they make public statements. If they expressed their honest views— about, say, their party’s policies—then achieving politically necessary compromises would be much more difficult. Clearly, the very insincerity that people decry shows that our government is functioning well.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines this reasoning?
A: A. Achieving political compromises is not all that is necessary for the proper functioning of a government.
B: B. Some political compromises are not in the best long-term interest of the government.
C: C. Voters often judge politicians by criteria other than the sincerity with which they express their views.
D: D. A political party’s policies could turn out to be detrimental to the functioning of a government.
E: E. Some of the public statements made by politicians about their party’s policies could in fact be sincere. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Politicians must often make insincere public statements because expressing their true feelings would make it harder for them to achieve politically necessary compromises.
### Reasoning: 
reasoning is that insincerity helps politicians achieve politically necessary compromises, and these compromises help our government to function well, so insincerity must show that our government is functioning well. Evidence that these necessary compromises do not ensure that our government functions well would undermine the argument’s reasoning, as would evidence that politicians’ insincerity has other substantial effects that hinder the government’s functioning.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If governments may function poorly even when insincerity allows necessary political compromises to be made, then the argument’s premises do not establish that politicians’ insincerity shows our government is functioning well.
Explanation B: B. The argument does not require that all political compromises help government to function well, only that politically necessary compromises do.
Explanation C: C. Even if voters often judge politicians by criteria other than their sincerity, they may also often decry politicians’ insincerity, not realizing or caring that such insincerity helps the government function well.
Explanation D: D. Even if a political party’s policies impair the government’s functioning, politically necessary compromises by politicians in that party could improve the government’s functioning.
Explanation E: E. Even if politicians sometimes speak sincerely about their party’s policies, their general willingness to be insincere as needed to achieve politically necessary compromises could be a sign that the government is functioning well.

### Context:
One summer, floods covered low-lying garlic fields situated in a region with a large mosquito population. Since mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water, flooded fields would normally attract mosquitoes, yet no mosquitoes were found in the fields. Diallyl sulfide, a major component of garlic, is known to repel several species of insects, including mosquitoes, so it is likely that diallyl sulfide from the garlic repelled the mosquitoes.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
A: A. Diallyl sulfide is also found in onions but at concentrations lower than in garlic.
B: B. The mosquito population of the region as a whole was significantly smaller during the year in which the flooding took place than it had been in previous years.
C: C. By the end of the summer, most of the garlic plants in the flooded fields had been killed by waterborne fungi.
D: D. Many insect species not repelled by diallyl sulfide were found in the flooded garlic fields throughout the summer.
E: E. Mosquitoes are known to be susceptible to toxins in plants other than garlic, such as marigolds. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 When summer floods covered garlic fields in an area with many mosquitoes, no mosquitoes were found in the fields, even though flooded fields would normally attract mosquitoes to lay their eggs in the water. Diallyl sulfide, which is found in garlic, repels mosquitoes and some other insect species and likely accounts for the lack of mosquitoes in the area.
### Reasoning: 
 Given the facts cited, what would provide additional evidence that diallyl sulfide from the garlic made mosquitoes avoid the flooded fields? The argument would be strengthened by any independent evidence suggesting that diallyl sulfide pervaded the flooded fields or excluding other factors that might explain the absence of mosquitoes in the fields.
Explanation A: A. This could strengthen the argument if mosquitoes also avoid flooded onion fields, but we do not know whether they do.
Explanation B: B. This would weaken the argument by suggesting that the general mosquito population decline, rather than the diallyl sulfide, could explain the absence of mosquitoes in the fields.
Explanation C: C. It is not clear how this would affect the amount of diallyl sulfide in the flooded fields, so this does not provide evidence that the diallyl sulfide repelled the mosquitoes.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This provides evidence that there was no factor other than diallyl sulfide that reduced insect populations in the flooded garlic fields.
Explanation E: E. If anything, this would weaken the argument, since it is at least possible that some of these toxins were present in the flooded fields.

### Context:
The population of desert tortoises in Targland’s Red Desert has declined, partly because they are captured for sale as pets and partly because people riding all-terrain vehicles have damaged their habitat. Targland plans to halt this population decline by blocking the current access routes into the desert and announcing new regulations to allow access only on foot. Targland’s officials predict that these measures will be adequate, since it is difficult to collect the tortoises without a vehicle. Which of the following would it be most important to establish in order to evaluate the

D: D. Whether people who travel on foot in the Red Desert often encounter the tortoises
E: E. Whether the Targland authorities held public hearings before restricting entry by vehicle into the Red Desert Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Desert tortoises in Targland’s Red Desert have been captured for sale as pets. Furthermore, these tortoises’ habitat has been damaged by people riding all- terrain vehicles. These factors have led to the decline of the tortoise population in the Red Desert, a decline Targland plans to halt by blocking current access and announcing new regulations limiting access to only by foot. Officials predict these will be adequate because prohibiting vehicles will make it harder to collect tortoises.
### Reasoning: 
 What would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the officials’ prediction? If Targland’s new restrictions are not enforceable, then there is good reason to doubt the officials’ prediction that these restrictions will be adequate to protect the tortoises. Thus, it would be useful to know whether either or both of the new restrictions can be enforced.
Explanation A: A. The prediction is not based on whether it is legally permissible to possess the tortoises as pets, but rather on whether people will be as capable of collecting them.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The prediction is based on whether Targland can effectively restrict access to foot traffic. If it cannot, and people can still gain entry to the desert using all-terrain vehicles at points other than the current access routes, then the fact that they would still be able to gain access casts doubt on the officials’ prediction.
Explanation C: C. The prediction in no way depends on whether the tortoises are most active during the day or at night.
Explanation D: D. The prediction is based on the difficulty of collecting tortoises without a vehicle— presumably because it would be harder to transport them. Therefore, it is not particularly relevant whether people on foot in the Red Desert often encounter tortoises.
Explanation E: E. The prediction would be just as likely to be accurate whether or not the Targland authorities held public hearings before restricting entry by vehicle to the desert. All that matters is whether the restrictions are effectively communicated and enforced.

### Context:
Yeasts capable of leavening bread are widespread, and in the many centuries during which the ancient Egyptians made only unleavened bread, such yeasts must frequently have been mixed into bread doughs accidentally. The Egyptians, however, did not discover leavened bread until about 3000 B.C. That discovery roughly coincided with the introduction of a wheat variety that was preferable to previous varieties because its edible kernel could be removed from the husk without first toasting the grain. Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest evidence that the two developments

### Question:
were causally related?
A: A. Even after the ancient Egyptians discovered leavened bread and the techniques for reliably producing it were well known, unleavened bread continued to be widely consumed.
B: B. Only when the Egyptians stopped the practice of toasting grain were their stone-lined grain-toasting pits available for baking bread.
C: C. Heating a wheat kernel destroys its gluten, a protein that must be present in order for yeast to leaven bread dough.
D: D. The new variety of wheat, which had a more delicate flavor because it was not toasted, was reserved for the consumption of high officials when it first began to be grown.
E: E. Because the husk of the new variety of wheat was more easily removed, flour made from it required less effort to produce. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Because they were widespread, yeasts capable of leavening bread most likely were occasionally accidentally mixed into the doughs of the unleavened bread made by ancient Egyptians. Despite this, Egyptians did not discover leavened bread until about 3000 B.C., around the time of the introduction of an improved variety of wheat that had kernels that could be removed from the husk without toasting.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence would suggest these developments were causally linked? If one of these two developments would not have been possible without the other, there is reason to think that the developments were causally linked in some way.
Explanation A: A. Continued consumption of unleavened bread tells us nothing about the improved variety of wheat and so provides no evidence regarding a causal link between that variety of wheat and the ancient Egyptians’ discovery of leavened bread.
Explanation B: B. The availability of the pits for baking bread does not indicate that leavened bread could not have been discovered, and then baked, in the ovens that were used previously to bake unleavened bread.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Because gluten is destroyed when a wheat kernel is toasted and gluten is necessary for yeast to be able to leaven dough, leavened dough was directly enabled by the introduction of the improved wheat variety.
Explanation D: D. The new variety of wheat could have been reserved for high officials because of its delicate flavor even if the ancient Egyptians had never discovered leavened bread, so it does not imply a causal link.
Explanation E: E. There is no evidence to suggest that the discovery of leavened bread was in any way linked to flour becoming easier to produce.

### Context:
In parts of the Caribbean, the manatee, an endangered marine mammal, has long been hunted for food. Having noted the manatee hunters’ expert knowledge of manatees’ habits, local conservationists are encouraging the hunters to stop hunting and instead to take tourists on boat rides to see manatees. Many tourists are interested, so the plan has promise of achieving the twin goals of giving the former hunters a good income and helping ensure the manatees’ survival.

C: C. In areas where manatees have traditionally been hunted for food, local people could easily replace the manatee meat in their diets with other foods obtained from the sea.
D: D. There would not be enough former manatee hunters to act as guides for all the tourists who want to see manatees.
E: E. To maintain a good income guiding tourists, manatee hunters would have to use far larger boats and make many more trips into the manatees’ fragile habitat than they currently do. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The hunters of manatees in the Caribbean are experts in the habits of the endangered animals. Because of this, conservationists are encouraging the hunters to stop hunting and to give tours to the many tourists who are interested in the animals, thereby helping to preserve manatees without forsaking their livelihoods.
### Reasoning: 
 What would cast doubt on this plan being successful? If there were additional evidence that switching to giving tours would be at least as harmful to the manatees’ survival as hunting, then this evidence would cast doubt on the plan’s likelihood of success.
Explanation A: A. The success of the plan would not depend on whether every Caribbean tourist has interest in taking a boat ride to see manatees; it merely requires that there be a large enough number of them.
Explanation B: B. This claim is relevant only if the plan is at least a partial success. It therefore provides no reason to believe the plan would not be successful.
Explanation C: C. If people who have traditionally consumed manatee meat as food could easily replace manatee meat in their diets, then that would suggest an additional reason why the plan might be successful rather than a failure.
Explanation D: D. This would provide some evidence that the plan might succeed, not fail, because it suggests that there would be plenty of work for the hunters, thereby helping to ensure that they had a good income.
Explanation E: E. Correct. If the hunters who switch from hunting to tourism would be required to have larger boats and increase their number of trips into the manatees’ fragile habitat to maintain a good income, then at least one of the two goals of the plan would be less likely to be met: Either the hunters would not be able to have a good income or the manatees’ habitat, and thereby the manatees themselves, would be at risk.

### Context:
Duckbill dinosaurs, like today’s monitor lizards, had particularly long tails, which they could whip at considerable speed. Monitor lizards use their tails to strike predators. However, although duckbill tails were otherwise very similar to those of monitor lizards, the duckbill’s tailbones were proportionately much thinner and thus more delicate. Moreover, to ward off their proportionately much larger predators, duckbills would have had to whip their tails considerably faster than monitor lizards do. The information given, if accurate, provides the strongest support for which of the following

### Question:
hypotheses?
A: A. If duckbills whipped their tails faster than monitor lizards do, the duckbill’s tail would have been effective at warding off the duckbills’ fiercest predators.
B: B. Duckbills used their tails to strike predators, and their tailbones were frequently damaged from the impact.
C: C. Using their tails was not the only means duckbills had for warding off predators.
D: D. Duckbills were at much greater risk of being killed by a predator than monitor lizards are.
E: E. The tails of duckbills, if used to ward off predators, would have been more likely than the tails of monitor lizards to sustain damage from the impact. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Duckbill dinosaur tails were like the tails of contemporary monitor lizards in that they were very long. They differed, though, in that their tailbones were much thinner and more delicate than monitor lizards’ tailbones. Monitor lizards use their tails to strike predators. If duckbills did so, they would have had to whip their tails much faster, as their predators were proportionately much larger.
### Reasoning: 
 Which hypothesis is most strongly supported by the given information? The information states that duckbills would have had to whip their tails much faster than monitor lizards do to ward off their proportionately larger predators, but their tailbones were more delicate. It would be reasonable to conclude, then, that duckbills’ tails would have been more likely to sustain damage if used to ward off predators than monitor lizards’ tails are.
Explanation A: A. The information gives us little reason to be confident that duckbills would have been effective at warding off their fiercest predators even if they whipped their tails faster than monitor lizards do. Note that we are not even told how effective monitor lizards are at warding off particularly fierce predators.
Explanation B: B. The information gives us both a reason to think that duckbills might have used their tails to strike predators—their tails are similar in length to the tails of monitor lizards, which are used to strike predators—and reasons to think they might not have done so—their tailbones were much thinner and more delicate than monitor lizards’ tailbones, and they would have had to whip their tails much faster than monitor lizards whip theirs. Therefore, the support for this answer choice is not very strong.
Explanation C: C. The information does give some modest support for the claim that duckbills’ tails would not provide a particularly good defense against their predators. This suggests weakly that they had other defenses against their predators. Note, though, that this answer choice, as worded, entails that duckbills did use their tails as a defense; it was simply not the only defense. But the information on which we are to base the hypothesis is compatible with duckbills not having used their tails to ward off predators.
Explanation D: D. The information does not give much support for this answer choice. It could be that duckbills had other effective defenses against their predators. Perhaps they were fast or had sharp claws.
Explanation E: E. Correct. As noted above, duckbills would have had to whip their tails much faster than monitor lizards do to ward off their proportionately larger predators, but their tailbones were more delicate, so duckbills’ tails would have been more likely to sustain damage if used to ward off predators than monitor lizards’ tails are.

### Context:
In an attempt to produce a coffee plant that would yield beans containing no caffeine, the synthesis of a substance known to be integral to the initial stages of caffeine production was blocked either in the beans, in the leaves, or both. For those plants in which synthesis of the substance was blocked only in the leaves, the resulting beans contained no caffeine. Any of the following, if true, would provide the basis for an explanation of the observed

### Question:
results EXCEPT:
A: A. In coffee plants, the substance is synthesized only in the leaves and then moves to the beans, where the initial stages of caffeine production take place.
B: B. In coffee plants, the last stage of caffeine production takes place in the beans using a compound that is produced only in the leaves by the substance.
C: C. In coffee plants, the initial stages of caffeine production take place only in the beans, but later stages depend on another substance that is synthesized only in the leaves and does not depend on the blocked substance.
D: D. In coffee plants, caffeine production takes place only in the leaves, but the caffeine then moves to the beans.
E: E. Caffeine was produced in the beans of the modified coffee plants, but all of it moved to the leaves, which normally produce their own caffeine. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The synthesis of a substance integral to the initial production of caffeine was blocked only in the beans of some coffee plants, only in the leaves of others, and in both the beans and leaves of yet other coffee plants. No caffeine was found in beans from the plants in which the synthesis of the substance was blocked only in the leaves.
### Reasoning: 
 Which claim would NOT form the basis for an explanation of the observed results? There are many possible explanations. For instance, the results could be explained by any claim that indicates (1) that the substance integral to the initial production of caffeine is synthesized only in the leaves, or (2) that the substance is also produced in the beans but, when it is blocked from being produced in the leaves, that substance or the caffeine that is produced in the beans is entirely depleted from the beans. However, the observed results would not be explained by any claim that (1) indicates that the early stages of caffeine synthesis can occur in the beans, entailing that the crucial substance is present in the beans even when it is blocked in the leaves, and (2) provides no explanation for why blocking the crucial substance in the leaves would prevent the completion of the caffeine synthesis in the beans.
Explanation A: A. If a substance that is integral to the initial production of caffeine is produced only in the leaves, and that production has been blocked, then the observed results are to be expected.
Explanation B: B. If the last stage of caffeine production requires a compound that is produced in the leaves by a substance the synthesis of which is blocked in the leaves, then the observed results are to be expected.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Suppose the initial stages of caffeine production take place in the beans. The substance integral to those initial stages must therefore be present in the beans. But this does not tell us whether that substance is synthesized in the beans or elsewhere. It does tell us that some other substance that plays a part in the production of caffeine is synthesized in the leaves, but we are not told that the synthesis of that substance is blocked. Therefore, this answer choice does not give us reason to expect the observed results, and so does not serve as the basis for an explanation of those results.
Explanation D: D. Suppose we know that caffeine production in coffee plants takes place entirely in the leaves but at least some of the caffeine migrates from there to the beans. Then, if the synthesis of a substance that is integral to the initial production of caffeine is blocked in the leaves, it seems reasonable to expect the observed results.
Explanation E: E. If caffeine is normally produced in both the leaves and the beans of a coffee plant, but all the caffeine produced in the beans will migrate from the beans to the leaves if for any reason caffeine is not produced in the leaves, then it is reasonable to expect the observed results.

### Context:
Which of the following most logically completes the passage? Laminated glass is much harder to break than the glass typically used in the windows of cars driven in Relnia. It is more difficult for thieves to break into cars with laminated glass windows than into cars with ordinary glass windows, and laminated glass windows are less likely to break in a collision. Nevertheless, considerations of security and safety do not unambiguously support a proposal to require that in Relnia all glass installed in cars be laminated glass, since

### Question:
__________.
A: A. most people cannot visually distinguish laminated glass from the glass typically used for car windows
B: B. a significant proportion of cars driven in Relnia are manufactured elsewhere
C: C. some cars in Relnia already have laminated glass in their windows
D: D. the rates of car theft and of collisions have both fallen slightly in Relnia in recent years
E: E. there are times when breaking a car’s window is the best way to provide timely help for people trapped inside Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Laminated glass is much more difficult to break than the glass that is typically used in car windows in Relnia and, when used in a car window, makes it harder for thieves to break into the car and is less likely to shatter in collisions.
### Reasoning: 
 What claim, despite the given information, most helps support the conclusion that considerations of security and safety do not unambiguously support a proposal to require that in Relnia all glass installed in cars be laminated glass? If there are any significant safety or security problems that would arise from having laminated glass, this would count against the proposal. For instance, sometimes it is essential to break a car’s window to help people trapped in the car.
Explanation A: A. None of the security- or safety-related characteristics of laminated glass discussed in the argument depend on laminated glass being visually distinguishable from the glass typically used for car windows. Therefore, this answer choice does not help justify the conclusion and so would not logically complete the passage.
Explanation B: B. Even if most cars in Relnia are manufactured elsewhere, there may be no reason not to require that all glass installed in cars in Relnia be laminated glass.
Explanation C: C. Whether some cars, no cars, or all cars currently in Relnia have laminated glass in their windows is irrelevant to whether it is a good idea to require that all glass installed in cars in Relnia be laminated glass.
Explanation D: D. Even if rates of car theft and of collision have fallen, that does not mean they could not fall further if laminated glass were required. In fact, we are not told why they fell. Could it be that more cars in Relnia had windows made of laminated glass, and that this led to these reduced rates?
Explanation E: E. Correct. This answer choice provides a reason to think that sometimes, for the security or safety of passengers in cars, it might be better not to have all the windows of every car made of laminated glass. Therefore, it logically completes the passage.

### Context:
Consultant: Ace Repairs ends up having to redo a significant number of the complex repair jobs it undertakes, but when those repairs are redone, they are invariably done right. Since we have established that there is no systematic difference between the mechanics who are assigned to do the initial repairs and those who are assigned to redo unsatisfactory jobs, we must reject the hypothesis that mistakes made in the initial repairs are due to the mechanics’ lack of competence. Rather, it is likely that complex repairs require a level of focused attention that the company’s mechanics apply consistently only to repair jobs that have not been done right on the first try.

### Question:
In the consultant’s reasoning, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first is the consultant’s main conclusion; the second provides evidence in support of that main conclusion.
B: B. The first is evidence that serves as the basis for rejecting one explanation of a certain finding; the second is the consultant’s own explanation of that finding.
C: C. The first is a claim whose truth is at issue in the reasoning; the second provides evidence to show that the claim is true.
D: D. The first presents a contrast whose explanation is at issue in the reasoning; the second is the consultant’s explanation of that contrast.
E: E. The first presents a contrast whose explanation is at issue in the reasoning; the second is evidence that has been used to challenge the consultant’s explanation of that contrast. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The following information is attributed to a consultant: Some complex repair jobs done by Ace Repairs have to be redone. The repairs, when redone, are usually successful. But the mechanics who do the initial repairs and any others who redo those repairs are, overall, competent to do the repairs successfully.
### Reasoning: 
 What role in the consultant’s reasoning do the boldfaced statements play? The consultant’s first sentence describes a phenomenon that could be puzzling and needs explanation. One might be inclined to argue that the mechanics who redo the repairs are more competent than those who did the initial repairs. But the second boldfaced statement rebuts this explanation by telling us that it has been established that there are no systematic differences in competence. The final sentence of the consultant’s reasoning puts forward another explanation: that the redoing of a repair elicits from mechanics a higher level of focused attention than did the performance of the initial repair.
Explanation A: A. The first describes a puzzling phenomenon for which the consultant seeks an explanation. It is not presented as a conclusion, i.e., a statement that is asserted on the basis of other statements. The second is not a statement presented in support of the first; it gives an explanation offered by the consultant for the puzzling phenomenon described in the first boldfaced portion.
Explanation B: B. The first describes a puzzling phenomenon for which the consultant seeks an explanation, and it is not offered to show that a certain explanation does not fit. The second gives the consultant’s own explanation of that finding.
Explanation C: C. The reasoning does not question the accuracy of the first boldfaced portion; that portion is a description of a phenomenon that the consultant believes needs explanation. The second is not meant as evidence to indicate that the first is true; rather, it is offered as an explanation for the puzzling phenomenon described in the first.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The first boldfaced portion contrasts the success of repairs that are redone with the failure of those repairs when they were first done. The second gives an explanation proposed by the consultant for the difference.
Explanation E: E. The first contrasts the success of repairs that are redone with the failure of those repairs when they were first done. Rather than giving evidence to challenge the consultant’s explanation, the second provides that explanation itself.

### Context:
To reduce waste of raw materials, the government of Sperland is considering requiring household appliances to be broken down for salvage when discarded. To cover the cost of salvage, the government is planning to charge a fee, which would be imposed when the appliance is first sold. Imposing the fee at the time of salvage would reduce waste more effectively, however, because consumers tend to keep old appliances longer if they are faced with a fee for discarding them.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A: A. Increasing the cost of disposing of an appliance properly increases the incentive to dispose of it improperly.
B: B. The fee provides manufacturers with no incentive to produce appliances that are more durable.
C: C. For people who have bought new appliances recently, the salvage fee would not need to be paid for a number of years.
D: D. People who sell their used, working appliances to others would not need to pay the salvage fee.
E: E. Many nonfunctioning appliances that are currently discarded could be repaired at relatively little expense. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A government is considering requiring household appliances to be broken down for salvage when discarded. To cover the salvage costs, the government plans to charge a fee on appliance sales.
### Reasoning: 
 What would suggest that charging the fee at the time of salvage would less effectively reduce waste than charging the fee at the time of sale would? The argument is that charging the fee at the time of salvage would reduce waste of raw materials because it would encourage consumers to keep their appliances longer before salvaging them. This argument could be weakened by pointing out other factors that might increase waste if the fee is charged at the time of salvage or reduce waste if the fee is charged at the time of sale.
Explanation A: A. Correct. This suggests that charging the fee at the time of salvage rather than the time of sale would encourage consumers to discard their appliances illegally, thereby increasing waste of raw materials by reducing the proportion of discarded appliances that are salvaged.
Explanation B: B. This factor would remain the same regardless of whether the fee was charged at the time of sale or the time of salvage.
Explanation C: C. This might be a reason for consumers to prefer the fee be charged at the time of salvage rather than the time of sale, but it does not suggest that charging the fee at the time of salvage would reduce waste less effectively.
Explanation D: D. This provides an additional reason to expect that charging the fee at the time of salvage would help reduce waste, so it strengthens rather than weakens the argument.
Explanation E: E. This would give consumers an additional reason to keep using their old appliances and postpone paying a fee at the time of salvage, so it strengthens rather than weakens the argument.

### Context:
When there is less rainfall than normal, the water level of Australian rivers falls and the rivers flow more slowly. Because algae whose habitat is river water grow best in slow-moving water, the amount of algae per unit of water generally increases when there has been little rain. By contrast, however, following a period of extreme drought, algae levels are low even in very slow-moving river water.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, does most to explain the contrast described above?
A: A. During periods of extreme drought, the populations of some of the species that feed on algae tend to fall.
B: B. The more slowly water moves, the more conducive its temperature is to the growth of algae.
C: C. When algae populations reach very high levels, conditions within the river can become toxic for some of the other species that normally live there.
D: D. Australian rivers dry up completely for short intervals in periods of extreme drought.
E: E. Except during periods of extreme drought, algae levels tend to be higher in rivers in which the flow has been controlled by damming than in rivers that flow freely. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 When Australian rivers flow slowly due to little rain, algae populations in those rivers increase. But after periods of extreme drought, algae levels are low even in water moving at speeds that would normally show population increases.
### Reasoning: 
 What would explain the contrast between algae levels in slow-moving water resulting from little rain and slow-moving water after a drought? There must be some difference between what happens during periods in which there is simply less rainfall than normal and periods in which there is extreme drought, a difference that affects the algae population.
Explanation A: A. This indicates one of the consequences of drought, and slightly suggests that this might be due to a lower algae level. But it does nothing to explain why algae levels might be lower after a drought.
Explanation B: B. This could explain why some rivers that are slow-moving and have little water might have a high algae level—but not why the algae level is low in such rivers after a period of drought.
Explanation C: C. This explains why levels of other species might be low when algae populations are high, not why algae populations are high when there is little rain, but low following a period of extreme drought.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This statement properly identifies something that helps explain the contrast. According to the information given, the habitat of the algae under discussion is river water. If the river dries up, the algae will probably not survive. Then after the drought, algae population levels would likely take a while to rise again.
Explanation E: E. This emphasizes that there is a contrast between what happens to algae during periods of extreme drought and what happens to them at other times, but it does not help explain that contrast.

### Context:
Increased use of incineration is sometimes advocated as a safe way to dispose of chemical waste. But opponents of incineration point to the 40 incidents involving unexpected releases of dangerous chemical agents that were reported just last year at two existing incinerators commissioned to destroy a quantity of chemical waste material. Since designs for proposed new incinerators include no additional means of preventing such releases, leaks will only become more prevalent if use of incineration increases.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A: A. At the two incinerators at which leaks were reported, staff had had only cursory training on the proper procedures for incinerating chemical waste.
B: B. Other means of disposing of chemical waste, such as chemical neutralization processes, have not been proven safer than incineration.
C: C. The capacity of existing incinerators is sufficient to allow for increased incineration of chemical waste without any need for new incinerators.
D: D. The frequency of reports of unexpected releases of chemical agents at newly built incinerators is about the same as the frequency at older incinerators.
E: E. In only three of the reported incidents of unexpected chemical leaks did the releases extend outside the property on which the incinerators were located. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Last year, at two chemical waste incinerators, there were forty reported incidents involving unexpected releases of dangerous chemicals. Designs for proposed new incinerators include no additional safeguards against such releases. Therefore, increased use of incineration will likely make such releases more prevalent.
### Reasoning: 
reasoning would be undermined by any evidence that the leaks at those two incinerators were the result of something other than insufficient safeguards against such releases.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If the staff training at the two incinerators was cursory, then the leaks may have been the results of staff not knowing how to use safeguards with which the incinerators are equipped that, if properly used, would have prevented the release of dangerous chemicals. Therefore, if staff at newer incinerators will be better trained, leaks might not become more prevalent even if chemical waste incineration becomes more common.
Explanation B: B. Other chemical waste disposal methods may be safer than incineration even if no one has proven so, and even if they’re not safer overall, they may involve fewer leaks.
Explanation C: C. Continuing to use existing incinerators might well produce just as many leaks as switching to new incinerators would.
Explanation D: D. This suggests that new incinerators produce as many leaks as older incinerators do, a finding that provides additional evidence that increased incineration even with proposed new incinerators would lead to more leaks.
Explanation E: E. The argument is not about how far the releases from leaks extend, only about how many of them are likely to occur.

### Response:

### Situation: 
 A public health expert argues against increasing the urgency of public health messages by pointing out negative effects that may arise from such an increase, as well as by questioning its efficacy.
### Reasoning: 
 What roles are played in the argument by the two claims in boldface? The first claim in boldface states that increasing the urgency of public health messages may be counterproductive. After making this claim, the public health expert mentions two specific reasons this could be so: it could irritate people who already behave responsibly, and it could convince people that all public health messages are too cautious (the latter reason in the second claim in boldface.) The phrase [i]n addition to indicates that neither claim in the second sentence is intended to support or explain the other. However, since each claim in the second sentence gives a reason to believe the claim in the first sentence, each independently supports the first sentence as a conclusion. The word [a]nd beginning the third sentence reveals that its intended role in the argument is the same as that of the two claims in the second sentence.
Explanation A: A. Everything stated after the first sentence is intended to help support it, so the first sentence is the argument’s main conclusion.
Explanation B: B. Everything stated after the first sentence is intended to help support it, so the first sentence is a conclusion, not a premise.
Explanation C: C. Each of the three claims in the second and third sentences is presented as an independent reason to accept the general claim in the first sentence. Therefore, nothing in the passage is intended to support the second statement in boldface as a conclusion.
Explanation D: D. Everything stated after the first sentence is intended to help support it, so the first sentence is a conclusion, not a premise.
Explanation E: E. Correct. Each of the three claims in the second and third sentences is presented as an independent reason to accept the general claim in the first sentence. Thus, each of those claims is a premise supporting the claim in the first sentence as the argument’s only conclusion.

### Context:
Several industries have recently switched at least partly from older technologies powered by fossil fuels to new technologies powered by electricity. It is thus evident that less fossil fuel is being used as a result of the operations of these industries than would have been used if these industries had retained their older technologies.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument above?
A: A. Many of the industries that have switched at least partly to the new technologies have increased their output.
B: B. Less fossil fuel was used to manufacture the machinery employed in the new technologies than was originally used to manufacture the machinery employed in the older technologies.
C: C. More electricity is used by those industries that have switched at least partly to the new technologies than by those industries that have not switched.
D: D. Some of the industries that have switched at least partly to the new technologies still use primarily technologies that are powered by fossil fuels.
E: E. The amount of fossil fuel used to generate the electricity needed to power the new technologies is less than the amount that would have been used to power the older technologies. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Several industries have now switched, at least partly, to technologies using electricity rather than fossil fuels. Thus, less fossil fuel will be consumed as a result of the operation of these industries than otherwise would have been.
### Reasoning: 
 Which option most strengthens the argument? One way to strengthen an argument is to eliminate or minimize one of its flaws or weaknesses. Because the conclusion is stated in terms of “fossil fuel consumed as a result of the operation of these industries,” the claim would encompass even any fossil fuel that might be used to generate the electricity that the newer technologies use. Yet the premise of the argument does not address this issue. So, the argument is strengthened if it turns out that less fossil fuel was used to produce the electricity than would have been used to power the older technologies.
Explanation A: A. In an indirect way, this answer choice slightly weakens rather than strengthens the argument. For if fossil fuels are used to produce the electricity now used by the industries, and if it is because of these newer technologies that output has increased, the argument’s conclusion is less likely.
Explanation B: B. It does not matter how much fossil fuel was used to manufacture the older technologies originally. That has no bearing on whether more fossil fuel would have been expended as a result of the continued operation of the industries if the partial switch to newer technologies had not occurred.
Explanation C: C. This is what we would expect, but it in no way strengthens the argument.
Explanation D: D. This may seem to weaken the argument by indicating that the switch from older technologies will have less of an impact on fossil fuel consumption by these industries than we might have assumed. But since the conclusion makes no claim about how much consumption has been reduced, it is not clear that this option has any bearing on the strength of the argument one way or the other.
Explanation E: E. Correct. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the conclusion is stated in terms of “fossil fuel consumed as a result of the operation of these industries,” so the claim would encompass even any fossil fuel that might be used to generate the electricity that the newer technologies use. If at least as much fossil fuel must be used to generate the needed electricity, the conclusion that less fossil fuel is used does not follow. Yet the premise of the argument does not address this issue. So, the argument is strengthened if it turns out that less fossil fuel is used to produce the electricity than would have been used to power the older technologies.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
Before answering, think carefully about the argument presented in the passage and the question. Create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response, focusing on argument analysis, assumptions, inferences, strengths, and weaknesses of the argument.

### Instruction:
You are a GMAT expert specializing in Critical Reasoning. Your task is to analyze the argument presented in the passage and answer the question that follows. Focus on identifying the premises, conclusion, assumptions, and logical fallacies in the argument. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Context:
The difference in average annual income in favor of employees who have college degrees, compared with those who do not have such degrees, doubled between 1980 and 1990. Some analysts have hypothesized that increased competition between employers for employees with college degrees drove up income for such employees.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the explanation described above?
A: A. During the 1980s a growing percentage of college graduates, unable to find jobs requiring a college degree, took unskilled jobs.
B: B. The average age of all employees increased slightly during the 1980s.
C: C. The unemployment rate changed very little throughout most of the 1980s.
D: D. From 1980 to 1990, the difference in average income between employees with advanced degrees and those with bachelor’s degrees also increased.
E: E. During the 1980s there were some employees with no college degree who earned incomes comparable to the top incomes earned by employees with a college degree. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The amount by which average annual income for employees with college degrees exceeds that for employees without such degrees doubled between 1980 and 1990.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence would most strongly suggest that increased competition among employers for employees with college degrees does not explain the relative increase in those employees’ incomes? Such increased competition could not explain the relative increase in income for employees with college degrees if the competition did not actually increase, or if such competition occurred but did not result in employers paying higher wages or salaries, or if the increase in competition to hire employees without college degrees was even greater. So, evidence that any of those conditions existed would undermine the analysts’ explanation.
Explanation A: A. Correct. This suggests that the supply of college graduates grew relative to employers’ demand for them, and hence that employers’ competition for college-educated employees did not actually increase.
Explanation B: B. The average age might have increased equally for employees with college degrees and for those without them, so the increase is not clearly relevant to explaining why the difference between these two groups’ average incomes grew.
Explanation C: C. Even if the overall unemployment rate did not change, competition for college-educated employees could have increased while competition for other employees decreased.
Explanation D: D. This statement gives information comparing income trends among two groups of those with college degrees and is irrelevant to the comparison of income trends for those with college degrees and those without college degrees.
Explanation E: E. Even if there was strong competition and high pay for certain unusual types of employees without college degrees, increasing competition for employees with college degrees might have explained the overall growing difference in average pay between employees with college degrees and those without.

### Context:
Which of the following most logically completes the passage? According to the last pre-election poll in Whippleton, most voters believe that the three problems government needs to address, in order of importance, are pollution, crime, and unemployment. Yet in the election, candidates from parties perceived as strongly against pollution were defeated, while those elected were all from parties with a history of opposing legislation designed to reduce pollution. These results should not be taken to indicate that the

### Question:
poll was inaccurate, however, since __________.
A: A. some voters in Whippleton do not believe that pollution needs to be reduced
B: B. every candidate who was defeated had a strong antipollution record
C: C. there were no issues other than crime, unemployment, and pollution on which the candidates had significant differences of opinion
D: D. all the candidates who were elected were perceived as being stronger against both crime and unemployment than the candidates who were defeated
E: E. many of the people who voted in the election refused to participate in the poll Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A pre-election poll indicated that most voters believed the three problems government needs to address, in order of importance, are pollution, crime, and unemployment. But in the election, candidates from parties with a history of opposing antipollution legislation beat candidates from parties perceived as more strongly against pollution.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most help explain how the poll might have been accurate despite the election results? Since the poll indicated that voters were most concerned about pollution, it suggested that candidates from antipollution parties would be more likely to be elected, other things being equal—and yet those candidates were not elected. There are many possible explanations for this outcome that are compatible with the poll having been accurate. For example, voters might have been swayed by the candidates’ personalities, qualifications, or advertising more than by their positions on the issues. Or some candidates might have convinced voters that their personal positions on the issues were different from those of their parties. Or voters might have chosen candidates based on their positions on crime and unemployment, considering those issues together more important than pollution alone. Any statement suggesting that any such factors explained the election results would logically complete the passage by providing a reason to believe that the poll could have been accurate despite those results.
Explanation A: A. If the number of voters who did not believe that pollution needed to be reduced was large enough to explain the election results, then the poll was probably inaccurate. So, this does not explain how the poll might have been accurate despite those results.
Explanation B: B. This eliminates the possibility that candidates were defeated for having weak antipollution records conflicting with their parties’ antipollution stances, so it eliminates one explanation of how the poll might have been accurate despite the election results. Thus, it slightly weakens the conclusion of the argument instead of providing a premise to support it.
Explanation C: C. This eliminates the possibility that differences of opinion among the candidates on these other issues might explain the election results, but it does not explain how the poll could have been accurate despite the election results.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The poll indicated that voters believed that the government needs to address crime and unemployment as well as pollution. So, if the poll was accurate, the election outcome might have resulted from voters considering candidates’ positions on crime and unemployment to be jointly more important than their positions on pollution.
Explanation E: E. If anything, this provides a reason to doubt that the poll accurately reflected voters’ opinions. It does not explain how the poll might have accurately reflected those opinions despite the election results.

### Context:
Manufacturing plants in Arundia have recently been acquired in substantial numbers by investors from abroad. Arundian politicians are proposing legislative action to stop such investment, justifying the proposal by arguing that foreign investors, opportunistically exploiting a recent fall in the value of the Arundian currency, were able to buy Arundian assets at less than their true value. Which of the following, if true, casts the most serious doubt on the adequacy of the Arundian

### Question:
politicians’ justification for the proposed legislation?
A: A. The Arundian government originally welcomed the fall in the value of the Arundian currency because the fall made Arundian exports more competitive on international markets.
B: B. Foreign investors who acquired Arundian manufacturing plants generally did so with no intention of keeping and running those plants over the long term.
C: C. Without the recent fall in the value of the Arundian currency, many of the Arundian assets bought by foreign investors would have been beyond the financial reach of those investors.
D: D. In Concordia, a country broadly similar to Arundia, the share of manufacturing assets that is foreign-controlled is 60 percent higher than it is in Arundia.
E: E. The true value of an investment is determined by the value of the profits from it, and the low value of the Arundian currency has depressed the value of any profits earned by foreign investors from Arundian assets. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 After a recent fall in the value of Arundian currency, foreign investors have been acquiring many Arundian manufacturing plants. Arundian politicians are proposing legislation to stop such investment.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most undermine the Arundian politicians’ justification for the proposed legislation? The politicians are justifying their proposal by claiming that foreign investors have been exploiting the fall in the currency’s value by buying Arundian assets at less than their true value (whatever that means). Any evidence that their claim is false or meaningless would undermine their justification for the proposal, as would any evidence that the claim, even if true, does not provide a good reason to stop the foreign investments.
Explanation A: A. This suggests that the foreign investors got a good deal on the manufacturing plants, since it provides evidence that those plants will now be more competitive and profitable. So, if anything, it supports the politicians’ justification for their proposal rather than undermining it.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that the foreign investors generally believe the manufacturing plants are undervalued and intend to sell them at a profit as soon as the currency rises enough. So, it supports the politicians’ justification for their proposal rather than undermining it.
Explanation C: C. This suggests that the recent fall in the currency’s value made Arundian assets cost less than usual for foreign investors, thus arguably allowing the investors to buy the assets at less than their true value. So, if anything, it supports the politicians’ justification for their proposal rather than undermining it.
Explanation D: D. The Arundian politicians might consider the example of Concordia to be a warning of the disaster that could befall Arundia unless the legislation is enacted. So, the situation in Concordia might be cited as support for the politicians’ justification of their proposal.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This implies that the fall in the Arundian currency’s value has reduced the true value of Arundian manufacturing plants and any profits they may make, so it undermines the politicians’ claim that the foreign investors exploited the fall in the currency’s value to acquire the plants for less than their true value.

### Context:
Proposal: Carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere block the escape of heat into space So, emission of these “greenhouse” gases contributes to global warming. In order to reduce global warming, emission of greenhouse gases needs to be reduced. Therefore, the methane now emitted from open landfills should instead be burned to produce electricity. Objection: The burning of methane generates carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most adequately counters the objection made to the proposal?
A: A. Every time a human being or other mammal exhales, there is some carbon dioxide released into the air.
B: B. The conversion of methane to electricity would occur at a considerable distance from the landfills.
C: C. The methane that is used to generate electricity would generally be used as a substitute for a fuel that does not produce any greenhouse gases when burned.
D: D. Methane in the atmosphere is more effective in blocking the escape of heat from the Earth than is carbon dioxide.
E: E. The amount of methane emitted from the landfills could be reduced if the materials whose decomposition produces methane were not discarded but recycled. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The greenhouse gases methane and carbon dioxide trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere and warm the planet. To reduce that global warming, emission of these gases needs to be reduced. For these reasons, someone has proposed that the methane emitted from landfills should be captured and burned to produce electricity. However, an objection to the proposal is that burning methane causes the release of carbon dioxide (another greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere.
### Reasoning: 
 What would be a logically effective response to counter the objection to the proposal? It is true that burning methane causes the release of carbon dioxide. However, if burning methane from landfills to generate electricity helps reduce net global warming, then the objection would not provide a good reason for rejecting the proposal. It turns out that, as a greenhouse gas, methane has a much more powerful impact on global warming than does carbon dioxide. This fact provides strong support for rejecting the objection to the proposal.
Explanation A: A. Clearly, the effects referred to here are unavoidable in the lives of humans and other mammals on Earth. The emissions that must be curtailed to avoid global warming are those that are avoidable as a result of voluntary human activity.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that there could be costs in implementing the proposal, but the possibility of such costs does not, by itself, counter the proposal. Such costs could presumably be reduced by better siting of landfills and electricity-generation plants.
Explanation C: C. This information, if true, would not counter the objection and would provide some support for it. We would still need some reason to believe that allowing carbon dioxide emissions from burning methane would be better than continuing to release methane itself. In the absence of such a reason, we should expect no net greenhouse-gas-related benefit in substituting the landfill-emitted methane for a fuel that produces no greenhouse gases.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This information provides a strong rebuttal of the objection. Since methane has more powerful global-warming effects than does carbon dioxide, there is a net greenhouse-gas-reduction benefit in generating electricity by burning methane from landfills even though that burning itself emits the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.
Explanation E: E. Undoubtedly, it would be better to reduce the amount of methane that landfills will generate in the future. However, the possibility of doing so tells us nothing about whether the potential emission of carbon dioxide provides a reason not to burn the methane that is currently emitted from landfills.

### Context:
Proposed new safety rules for the Beach City airport would lengthen considerably the minimum time between takeoffs from the airport. In consequence, the airport would be able to accommodate 10 percent fewer flights than currently use the airport daily. The city’s operating budget depends heavily on taxes generated by tourist spending, and most of the tourists come by plane. Therefore, the proposed new safety rules, if adopted, will reduce the revenue available for the operating budget.

### Question:
The argument depends on assuming which of the following?
A: A. There are no periods of the day during which the interval between flights taking off from the airport is significantly greater than the currently allowed minimum.
B: B. Few, if any, of the tourists who use the Beach City airport do so when their main destination is a neighboring community and not Beach City itself.
C: C. If the proposed safety rules are adopted, the reduction in tourist numbers will not result mainly from a reduction in the number of tourists who spend relatively little in Beach City.
D: D. Increasing the minimum time between takeoffs is the only way to achieve necessary safety improvements without a large expenditure by the city government on airport enhancements.
E: E. The response to the adoption of the new safety rules would not include an increase in the number of passengers per flight. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Proposed safety rules for a city airport would reduce the number of daily flights the airport can accommodate. The city’s operating budget depends heavily on taxes generated by tourists, who mostly come by plane. Therefore, adopting the safety rules will result in lower revenue available for the operating budget.
### Reasoning: 
reasoning is that since the rules would reduce the number of flights that can be accommodated, they would thereby reduce the number of tourists arriving by plane, which in turn would reduce the tax revenue that tourist spending generates for the operating budget. This assumes that the actual number of daily flights would fall along with the number that the airport can accommodate; that fewer daily flights would mean fewer people flying into the airport; that fewer people flying into the airport would mean fewer tourists flying into the airport; that fewer tourists flying into the airport would mean fewer tourists visiting the city; that fewer tourists visiting the city would mean less taxable spending by tourists; and that less taxable spending by tourists would mean less revenue overall for the operating budget.
Explanation A: A. Even if flights depart the airport less frequently during some periods of the day, increasing the minimum time between flights at busy times of day could reduce the total number of daily flights from the airport.
Explanation B: B. Even if half the tourists flying into the airport were bound for other nearby towns, the other half could still spend enough in town to generate lots of revenue for the operating budget.
Explanation C: C. It is possible that most tourists spend relatively little in the city, but a few spend a lot. In that case, even if a reduction in tourist numbers resulted mainly from a declining number of tourists who spend relatively little, it could also greatly reduce the already small number of tourists who spend a lot.
Explanation D: D. This suggests that the proposed rules might be financially better for the city than any alternative way to improve safety, whereas the argument’s conclusion is that the proposed rules are financially disadvantageous.
Explanation E: E. Correct. If adopting the proposed rules would result in a large increase in the number of passengers per flight, fewer daily flights would not necessarily mean fewer passengers or fewer tourists overall.

### Context:
The introduction of new drugs into the market is frequently prevented by a shortage of human subjects for the clinical trials needed to show that the drugs are safe and effective. Since the lives and health of people in future generations may depend on treatments that are currently experimental, practicing physicians are morally in the wrong when, in the absence of any treatment proven to be effective, they fail to encourage suitable patients to volunteer for clinical trials.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, casts most doubt on the conclusion of the argument?
A: A. Many drugs undergoing clinical trials are intended for the treatment of conditions for which there is currently no effective treatment.
B: B. Patients do not share the physician’s professional concern for public health, but everyone has a moral obligation to alleviate suffering when able to do so.
C: C. Usually, half the patients in a clinical trial serve as a control group and receive a nonactive drug in place of the drug being tested.

E: E. Physicians have an overriding moral and legal duty to care for the health and safety of their current patients. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A shortage of human subjects for clinical trials needed to show that new drugs are safe and effective often prevents those drugs from being introduced into the market. The lives and health of future generations may depend on treatments that are now experimental.
### Reasoning: 
 What would cast doubt on the judgment that doctors are morally obligated to encourage their patients to volunteer for clinical trials? Note that the argument’s conclusion, unlike its premises, is a moral judgment. This judgment could be cast into doubt by a moral principle that would be likely to conflict with it under the conditions described. For example, a principle suggesting that it is sometimes morally unacceptable for doctors to encourage their patients to volunteer for clinical trials would also suggest that they are not morally obligated to encourage their patients to volunteer for clinical trials, since anything morally obligatory must also be morally acceptable.
Explanation A: A. If anything, this highlights how important it is to ensure that these drugs undergo clinical trials to benefit future generations, so it supports rather than casts doubt on the argument’s conclusion.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that patients are morally obligated to volunteer for clinical trials to help prevent suffering in future generations. If anything, this supports the claim that doctors are morally obligated to encourage their patients to volunteer.
Explanation C: C. The clinical trial will probably not harm any patients in the control group, yet their participation will benefit future generations. So, if anything, this supports the claim that doctors should encourage their patients to volunteer.
Explanation D: D. This legal barrier makes it even more essential for the drugs to undergo clinical trials in order to benefit patients, so it supports rather than casts doubt on the argument’s conclusion.
Explanation E: E. Correct. Since the experimental drugs’ safety is being tested during the trials, the drugs may prove unsafe for subjects in the trials. If doctors have an overriding moral duty to keep their current patients safe, then it may be morally unacceptable for them to encourage those patients to volunteer for the trials.

### Context:
As a construction material, bamboo is as strong as steel and sturdier than concrete  Moreover, in tropical areas, bamboo is a much less expensive construction material than either steel or concrete and is always readily available. In tropical areas, therefore, building with bamboo makes better economic sense than building with steel or concrete, except where land values are high.

A: A. Buildings constructed of bamboo are less likely to suffer earthquake damage than are steel and concrete buildings.
B: B. Bamboo is unsuitable as a building material for multistory buildings.

E: E. Bamboo growing in an area where land values are increasing is often cleared to make way for construction. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Bamboo is as strong as steel and sturdier than concrete when used as a construction material. In tropical areas, bamboo is much less expensive and is always readily available.
### Reasoning: 
 What explains the exception specified in the conclusion? The argument’s conclusion is that in tropical areas, bamboo is a more economical building material than steel or concrete, except where land values are high. The information in the passage makes clear why bamboo is a more economical building material in tropical areas than are concrete or steel. So the question is: Why must an exception be made for areas where land values are high? Multistory buildings are particularly desirable in areas where land values are high, but bamboo may not be suitable for such buildings.
Explanation A: A. This explains why bamboo would be preferable to steel or concrete in tropical areas especially prone to earthquakes. However, there is no clear connection to be made between areas where land values are high and areas especially prone to earthquakes.
Explanation B: B. Correct. Multistory buildings provide a greater area of floor space for a given site area, and in that sense are more economical. A single-story building with the same floor space will occupy a much bigger site, so the higher the land values, the more likely it is that a multistory building will be built on that land. Thus, given this information, bamboo is less suitable for areas where land values are high.
Explanation C: C. This undermines, to some extent, the claim that bamboo is an economical building material. But it does nothing to explain why it would be less economical specifically in areas where land values are high.
Explanation D: D. This is irrelevant. Bamboo is used to build scaffolding for construction projects and as a building material for permanent structures. There is no way to infer from this that bamboo is less economical specifically in areas where land values are high.
Explanation E: E. The fact that bamboo is cleared from an area to make room for construction in no way implies that bamboo would not be a suitable and economical building material for the area once it has been cleared.

### Context:
The country of Virodia has, until now, been barely self-sufficient in both meat and grain Greater prosperity there has gone hand in hand with steadily increasing per capita consumption of meat, and it takes several pounds of grain used as feed to produce one pound of meat. Per capita income is almost certain to rise further, yet increases in domestic grain production are unlikely.

### Question:
Which of the following is most strongly supported by the information given?
A: A. Some land in Virodia that is currently used for grain production will soon be turned into pastureland for grazing cattle for meat.
B: B. In the future, per capita income in Virodia is unlikely to increase as rapidly as it has in the past.
C: C. In Virodia, the amount of grain it takes to produce one pound of meat is likely to increase in coming years.
D: D. Grain is soon likely to make up a larger proportion of the average Virodian’s diet than ever before.
E: E. Virodia is likely to become an importer of grain or meat or both. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Virodia has been barely self-sufficient in both meat and grain. Recently per capita meat consumption in Virodia has been increasing. Recent increases in per capita income will probably continue, but production of grain will probably not increase. It takes several pounds of grain to produce each pound of meat.
### Reasoning: 
 What claim is most strongly supported by the given information? We are told that producing a pound of meat requires several pounds of grain. If (1) more meat is going to be consumed in Virodia, (2) more grain will not be produced, and (3) there is no excess grain, then Virodia will have to import meat, or import grain so it can produce more meat, or both.
Explanation A: A. The information given says nothing about pastureland for grazing cattle, and it provides no evidence that meat producers would be able to produce more meat per area of land by using the land for pasture than by using it for grain production. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the meat in Virodia is produced from cattle rather than from some other types of animals that are fed on grain. Given that the information suggests that there may be an increase in demand for grain, it seems unlikely that there will be a reduction in the amount of land used to produce grain.
Explanation B: B. The information says that per capita income is likely to increase and that greater prosperity correlates positively with greater meat consumption. It provides no reason to think that the correlation between rising income and increasing meat consumption occurs only with more rapid rises in income.
Explanation C: C. Nothing in the information given provides any evidence as to whether the amount of grain needed to produce a pound of meat will change.
Explanation D: D. The information indicates that per capita meat consumption is likely to continue to increase, which actually supports the opposite of what this answer choice states.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The information indicates that grain production will probably not increase. We are told, however, that meat consumption will increase. Meat production in Virodia requires a substantial amount of grain, and we know that Virodia produces no excess grain or meat. This indicates that Virodia will likely have to become an importer of meat, or, if not, it will have to become an importer of grain so that it will be able to produce more meat.

 The headlines newspaper reporters write for their own stories are often clever only because they allude to little-known information that never appears explicitly in the stories themselves.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most help the argument support the conclusion that newspaper editors should not allow reporters to write headlines for their own stories? The argument’s only explicit premise is that the headlines newspaper reporters write for their own stories are often clever only because they allude to little- known information that never appears explicitly in the stories themselves. In order for this premise to support the conclusion that newspaper editors should not allow reporters to write their own headlines, it would be helpful to be given a reason why editors should avoid headlines alluding to such little- known information.
Explanation A: A. This suggests that reporters are likely to write better headlines for their stories than editors are, so it weakens the argument that editors should not allow reporters to write their own headlines.
Explanation B: B. Since a reporter who wrote a story is likely to understand that story well, this does not provide a reason why editors should not allow reporters to write their own headlines.
Explanation C: C. If most reporters did what is suggested, they could perhaps hone their headline-writing skills—unless almost all reporters are weak in such skills, as suggested in the given information. The fact that they do not bother to do so may help explain why reporters’ headline-writing skills are weak. An explanation of why this is so does not provide additional support for the argument’s conclusion.
Explanation D: D. The people who know more about a story’s subject matter than the reporter writing the story might be just as likely to see the cleverness of allusions to little-known information as the reporters are. So, to the extent that this is relevant at all, it slightly weakens the argument by suggesting that obscurely clever headlines sometimes function as intended.
Explanation E: E. Correct. The argument’s explicit premise suggests that typically a reporter’s headline for his or her own story cannot be recognized as clever by a reader who has read the whole story. So, if editors want headlines that anyone who has read the accompanying stories would recognize as clever, they have a reason not to let reporters write the headlines.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
Before answering, think carefully about the argument presented in the passage and the question. Create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response, focusing on argument analysis, assumptions, inferences, strengths, and weaknesses of the argument.

### Instruction:
You are a GMAT expert specializing in Critical Reasoning. Your task is to analyze the argument presented in the passage and answer the question that follows. Focus on identifying the premises, conclusion, assumptions, and logical fallacies in the argument. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Context:
Scientists have modified feed corn genetically, increasing its resistance to insect pests  Farmers who tried out the genetically modified corn last season applied less insecticide to their corn fields and still got yields comparable to those they would have gotten with ordinary corn. Ordinary corn seed, however, costs less, and what these farmers saved on insecticide rarely exceeded their extra costs for seed. Therefore, for most feed-corn farmers, switching to genetically modified seed would be unlikely to increase profits.

### Question:
Which of the following would it be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument?
A: A. Whether there are insect pests that sometimes reduce feed-corn yields, but against which commonly used insecticides and the genetic modification are equally ineffective
B: B. Whether the price that farmers receive for feed corn has remained steady over the past few years
C: C. Whether the insecticides typically used on feed corn tend to be more expensive than insecticides typically used on other crops
D: D. Whether most of the farmers who tried the genetically modified corn last season applied more insecticide than was actually necessary
E: E. Whether, for most farmers who plant feed corn, it is their most profitable crop Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Farmers who grew feed corn genetically engineered to be pest resistant got yields comparable to those of farmers growing ordinary feed corn, but they did so while using less pesticide. Since the amount saved on pesticide was rarely in excess of the extra costs for the genetically modified corn, most farmers will probably not increase profits by choosing the genetically engineered variety.
### Reasoning: 
 Which would be most useful to know in evaluating the argument? To answer a question such as this, one should look for information that would strengthen or weaken the argument. If one had information that the farmers growing the genetically modified corn could have increased their yields last year at lower cost, this would be helpful in evaluating the argument, because this would show that the argument is weak.
Explanation A: A. It does not matter to the argument whether there are pests against which pesticides and genetic resistance are equally ineffective, because that is compatible with there being pests against which they are not equally effective.
Explanation B: B. Whether prices of feed corn go up or down affects the comparison groups equally.
Explanation C: C. The relative cost of insecticides for other crops has no bearing on the argument because the argument is concerned with only feed corn.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This option provides the information that it would be most useful to know in evaluating the argument. It shows that farmers growing genetically modified corn last year could have attained higher profits than they in fact did.
Explanation E: E. The argument concerns only the relative profitability of growing one variety of feed corn versus another.

### Context:
Debater: The average amount of overtime per month worked by an employee in the manufacturing division of the Haglut Corporation is 14 hours. Most employees of the Haglut Corporation work in the manufacturing division. Furthermore, the average amount of overtime per month worked by any employee in the company generally does not fluctuate much from month to month. Therefore, each month, most employees of the Haglut Corporation almost certainly work at least some overtime.

### Question:
The debater’s argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which of these grounds?
A: A. It takes for granted that the manufacturing division is a typical division of the corporation with regard to the average amount of overtime its employees work each month.
B: B. It takes for granted that if a certain average amount of overtime is worked each month by each employee of the Haglut Corporation, then approximately the same amount of overtime must be worked each month by each employee of the manufacturing division.
C: C. It confuses a claim from which the argument’s conclusion about the Haglut Corporation would necessarily follow with a claim that would follow from the argument’s conclusion only with a high degree of probability.
D: D. It overlooks the possibility that even if, on average, a certain amount of overtime is worked by the members of some group, many members of that group may work no overtime at all.
E: E. It overlooks the possibility that even if most employees of the corporation work some overtime each month, any one corporate employee may, in some months, work no overtime. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Most of the employees of the Haglut Corporation work in the manufacturing division, where employees average 14 hours per month in overtime. The average amount of overtime per month for employees at Haglut does not fluctuate much from month to month.
### Reasoning: 
 What is the argument’s greatest weakness? The argument’s conclusion is that almost certainly each month most of the employees of Haglut work at least some overtime. Answer choice D identifies the argument’s greatest weakness because it points out how the conclusion of the argument could be false even if all of the supporting information were true. For example, it could be that less than half of the employees work any overtime at all, but those that do work overtime work much more than 14 hours per month.
Explanation A: A. The argument leaves open the possibility that in some divisions of the corporation, the average monthly overtime of its employees is quite different from 14 hours, even if (as the argument states) that average does not change much from month to month.
Explanation B: B. The argument does not assume that there is a monthly amount of overtime worked by each employee of the manufacturing division equivalent to the company-wide average monthly overtime per employee.
Explanation C: C. This does not identify a weakness that can be detected in the argument. Since the claims mentioned here are not specified, the passage provides no evidence that clearly indicates that this type of confusion is playing a role in the argument.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The argument ignores the possibility that most of the employees of Haglut work no overtime at all in a particular month—which is quite consistent with the argument’s assertion that the average number of monthly overtime hours per employee within the manufacturing division is 14.
Explanation E: E. The possibility described by this is not overlooked by the argument, because this possibility is consistent with the conclusion. It could easily be that most employees of the corporation work some overtime each month—as the conclusion envisions—but that there are always some employees who do not work any overtime.

### Context:
Proponents of the recently introduced tax on sales of new luxury boats had argued that a tax of this sort would be an equitable way to increase government revenue because the admittedly heavy tax burden would fall only on wealthy people, and neither they nor anyone else would suffer any economic hardship. In fact, however, 20 percent of the workers employed by manufacturers of luxury boats have lost their jobs as a direct result of this tax.

### Question:
The information given, if true, most strongly supports which of the following?
A: A. The market for luxury boats would have collapsed even if the new tax on luxury boats had been lower.
B: B. The new tax would produce a net gain in tax revenue for the government only if the yearly total revenue that it generates exceeds the total of any yearly tax-revenue decrease resulting from the workers’ loss of jobs.
C: C. Because many people never buy luxury items, imposing a sales tax on luxury items is the kind of legislative action that does not cost incumbent legislators much popular support.
D: D. Before the tax was instituted, luxury boats were largely bought by people who were not wealthy.
E: E. Taxes can be equitable only if their burden is evenly distributed over the entire population. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Proponents of a recently introduced tax on sales of new luxury boats argued that it would be an equitable way to increase government revenue because the tax would fall only on the wealthy and cause no economic hardship. But because of the tax, 20 percent of luxury-boat manufacturing workers have lost their jobs.
### Reasoning: 
 What conclusion do the statements about the proponents’ argument and the tax’s effects support? Since the tax caused many workers to lose their jobs, apparently the proponents were incorrect in asserting that it would cause no one to suffer any economic hardship. Thus, their justification for concluding that the tax is an equitable way to increase government revenue is factually inaccurate, casting doubt on that conclusion.
Explanation A: A. The passage indicates that the tax directly caused a significant decrease (though not necessarily a collapse) in the market for luxury boats. But the passage contains no evidence about whether such a decrease might not have occurred if the new tax had been somewhat lower.
Explanation B: B. Correct. Since the tax caused the workers to lose their jobs, it might have made the government lose revenue from payroll taxes that the laid-off workers would have paid if they had kept their jobs. So, if the yearly total revenue generated directly and indirectly by the tax were less than those total yearly payroll taxes and any other tax revenue that was lost as a result of the tax, the tax would have caused a net loss in tax revenue.
Explanation C: C. The passage contains no information about what types of legislative actions cost, or do not cost, incumbent legislators popular support.
Explanation D: D. Although the passage suggests that some of the tax proponents’ assumptions were wrong, it contains no information suggesting that those proponents were wrong in thinking that luxury boats are purchased mainly by wealthy people.
Explanation E: E. The passage does not provide any basis for determining what makes a tax equitable or about whether the luxury boat tax is equitable. The tax’s proponents evidently felt that a tax whose burden falls only on the wealthy rather than evenly on the entire population can be equitable.

### Context:
In Wareland last year, 16 percent of licensed drivers under 21 and 11 percent of drivers ages 21–24 were in serious accidents. By contrast, only 3 percent of licensed drivers 65 and older were involved in serious accidents. These figures clearly show that the greater experience and developed habits of caution possessed by drivers in the 65-and-older group make them far safer behind the wheel than the younger drivers are.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A: A. Drivers 65 and older do not, on average, drive very many fewer miles per year than drivers 24 and younger.
B: B. Drivers 65 and older do not constitute a significantly larger percentage of licensed drivers in Wareland than drivers ages 18–24 do.
C: C. Drivers 65 and older are less likely than are drivers 24 and younger to drive during weather conditions that greatly increase the risk of accidents.
D: D. The difference between the accident rate of drivers under 21 and of those ages 21–24 is attributable to the greater driving experience of those in the older group.
E: E. There is no age bracket for which the accident rate is lower than it is for licensed drivers 65 and older. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Last year in Wareland, a much higher percentage of drivers 24 and under than of drivers 65 and older were in serious accidents.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true for the observation about the accident rates to support the conclusion that the greater experience and caution of drivers 65 and older make them safer behind the wheel than the younger drivers? Several factors other than greater experience and caution could explain the lower accident rate among the older drivers. For example, the older drivers might simply drive much less than the younger ones but still get in just as many accidents per mile driven. Or perhaps because the older drivers are more often retired, their schedules less often lead them to drive at times of day when accident rates are greater for everyone. Or they might be more likely to live in rural areas with less traffic and lower accident rates. The argument depends on assuming that none of these factors fully explains the difference in accident rates.
Explanation A: A. Correct. Although we are given no information about the possible extent of any difference in average miles driven, the (somewhat vague) information that drivers 65 and older drive very many fewer miles per year, on average, than drivers 24 and younger would cast serious doubt on the statistical argument given. The argument assumes that the difference in miles driven is not sufficiently substantial to undermine the argument.
Explanation B: B. The argument is only about the discrepancy between the percentages of the drivers in two specific age groups who were in serious accidents last year. The percentages of licensed drivers who fall in these age groups are irrelevant.
Explanation C: C. Even if drivers 65 and older are just as likely as younger drivers to drive in inclement weather, they may do so far more carefully than the younger drivers, so the older drivers’ greater experience and caution could still explain their lower accident rates.
Explanation D: D. Even if greater experience does not explain the difference between the accident rates of the two younger groups of drivers, it might still explain the differences between the accident rate of those two younger groups taken together and that of drivers aged 65 and older.
Explanation E: E. The accident rate could be lower for drivers in late middle age than for those 65 and older because drivers in late middle age are also cautious and experienced, but their reflexes and vision tend to be less impaired. Even if that were true, the experience and caution of the drivers 65 and older might still make them safer than drivers 24 and under.

### Context:
In the past, the country of Malvernia has relied heavily on imported oil  Malvernia recently implemented a program to convert heating systems from oil to natural gas. Malvernia currently produces more natural gas each year than it uses, and oil production in Malvernian oil fields is increasing at a steady pace. If these trends in fuel production and usage continue, therefore, Malvernian reliance on foreign sources for fuel is likely to decline soon.

### Question:
Which of the following would it be most useful to establish in evaluating the argument?
A: A. When, if ever, will production of oil in Malvernia outstrip production of natural gas?
B: B. Is Malvernia among the countries that rely most on imported oil?
C: C. What proportion of Malvernia’s total energy needs is met by hydroelectric, solar, and nuclear power?
D: D. Is the amount of oil used each year in Malvernia for generating electricity and fuel for transportation increasing?
E: E. Have any existing oil-burning heating systems in Malvernia already been converted to natural-gas-burning heating systems? Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Malvernia has relied heavily on imported oil but recently began a program to convert heating systems from oil to natural gas. Malvernia produces more natural gas than it uses. Furthermore, Malvernia’s oil production is expanding, Therefore, Malvernia will probably reduce its reliance on imported oils if these trends continue.
### Reasoning: 
 Which option provides the information that it would be most useful to know in evaluating the argument? In other words, we are looking for the option which —depending on whether it was answered yes or no—would either most weaken or most strengthen the argument. The argument indicates that Malvernia will be using less oil for heating and will be producing more oil domestically. But the conclusion that Malvernia’s reliance on foreign oil will decline, assuming the current trends mentioned continue, would be undermined if there was something in the works that could offset these trends —for instance, if it turned out that the country’s need for oil was going to rise in the coming years.
Explanation A: A. Since both domestic oil production and domestic natural gas production counteract the need for imported oil, it makes little difference to the argument whether domestic oil production exceeds domestic natural gas.
Explanation B: B. Whether there are many countries that rely more on foreign oil than Malvernia would have little impact on whether Malvernia’s need for foreign oil can be expected to decline.
Explanation C: C. Since there is no information in the argument about whether Malvernia can expect an increase or decrease from these other energy sources, it does not matter how much they now provide.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This option provides the information that it would be most useful to know in evaluating the argument. As explained in the Reasoning section above, if Malvernia’s need for oil rises in the coming years, the conclusion that Malvernia’s reliance on foreign oil will decline is undermined.
Explanation E: E. The argument tells us that a program has begun recently to convert heating systems from oil to gas. So, even if no such conversions have been completed, the argument still indicates that they can be expected to occur.

### Context:
Exposure to certain chemicals commonly used in elementary schools as cleaners or pesticides causes allergic reactions in some children. Elementary school nurses in Renston report that the proportion of schoolchildren sent to them for treatment of allergic reactions to those chemicals has increased significantly over the past ten years. Therefore, either Renston’s schoolchildren have been exposed to greater quantities of the chemicals or they are more sensitive to them than schoolchildren were ten years ago.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A: A. The number of school nurses employed by Renston’s elementary schools has not decreased over the past ten years.
B: B. Children who are allergic to the chemicals are no more likely than other children to have allergies to other substances.
C: C. Children who have allergic reactions to the chemicals are not more likely to be sent to a school nurse now than they were ten years ago.
D: D. The chemicals are not commonly used as cleaners or pesticides in houses and apartment buildings in Renston.
E: E. Children attending elementary school do not make up a larger proportion of Renston’s population now than they did ten years ago. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Some children have allergic reactions to some of the chemicals commonly used in elementary schools as cleaners and pesticides. The number of children sent to elementary school nurses in Renston for allergic reactions to such chemicals has risen significantly over the past ten years.
### Reasoning: 
 What must the argument assume? The argument’s conclusion presents just two alternatives: either the children are exposed to more of the chemicals than children in earlier years or they are more sensitive. But there is a third possible explanation for the significant increase in school-nurse visits that the school nurses have reported: that children are just more inclined to go to the school nurse when they experience an allergic reaction than were children several years ago. For the conclusion to follow from its premises, the argument must assume that this is not the correct explanation.
Explanation A: A. If the number of school nurses in Renston elementary schools had decreased over the past ten years, that would in no way explain the rise in the proportion of children reporting to school nurses for allergic reactions.
Explanation B: B. Only school-nurse visits for allergic reactions to the cleaners and pesticides used in elementary schools are in question in the argument. Of course there could be school- nurse visits for allergic reactions to other things, but that issue does not arise in the argument.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This can be seen by considering whether the argument would work if we assume that this were false, i.e., that a school-nurse visit is more likely in such cases. As noted above, this provides an alternative to the two explanations that the conclusion claims are the sole possibilities.
Explanation D: D. This does not need to be assumed by the argument. The argument’s conclusion suggests that children may in recent years have had greater exposure to the chemicals, not that this exposure has occurred exclusively in the schools. The argument does not rely on this latter assumption.
Explanation E: E. The argument does not need to make this assumption. The argument is framed in terms of proportions of children having school-nurse visits for certain allergic reactions. How many children there are or what proportion such children are of Renston’s total population is not directly relevant to the argument.

### Context:
Lockeport’s commercial fishing boats use gill nets, which kill many of the netted fish, including some fish of endangered species. The fishing commission has proposed requiring the use of tent nets, which do not kill fish; boat crews would then throw back fish of endangered species. Profitable commercial fishing boats in similar areas have already switched over to tent nets. The proposal can therefore be implemented without economic harm to Lockeport’s commercial fishing boat operators.

proposal?
A: A. In places where the use of tent nets has been mandated, there are typically fewer commercial fishing boats in operation than there were before tent nets came into use.
B: B. Even when used properly, gill nets require many more repairs than do tent nets.
C: C. Recreational anglers in Lockeport catch more fish of endangered species than do commercial fishing boats.
D: D. The endangered species of fish in Lockeport’s commercial fishing area did not become endangered as a result of the use of gill nets by fishing fleets.
E: E. The endangered species of fish caught by Lockeport’s commercial fishing fleet are of no commercial value. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Gill nets, used by Lockeport’s commercial fishing boats, kill some fish of endangered species. The fishing commission has proposed requiring the use of tent nets, which do not kill fish. This would allow the fish of endangered species to be thrown back. It is argued that the proposed requirement will not harm commercial fishing boat operators, since commercial fishing boats in other similar places are using tent nets and are profitable.
### Reasoning: 
 What new piece of information would weaken the argument for the proposed requirement? The crucial support given for the argument is that in other similar places, commercial fishing boats that use tent nets and not gill nets are profitable. But if, in places where only tent nets are now used, the numbers of commercial fishing boats diminished, it would be reasonable to suspect that switching entirely to tent nets may have driven some of the fishing operations out of business or caused them to move to other areas in which there was no expectation that they would use only tent nets.
Explanation A: A. Correct. This is new information. As explained above, it would justify doubt about the argument made in favor of the proposal.
Explanation B: B. This suggests that implementation of the proposed requirement could, over time, lower a certain type of operational costs for commercial fishing boats using tent nets. This would provide a new reason in support of the proposed requirement, not a reason to doubt the argument for it.
Explanation C: C. This suggests that perhaps recreational fishing in Lockeport needs to be regulated more strictly, but that is a separate issue from the one addressed in the argument for the proposed tent-net requirement.
Explanation D: D. This information casts no doubt on the relevance of the stated information that using gill nets contributes to undermining populations of at least some of the endangered fish species in Lockeport. If the species are currently endangered, they may need protection regardless of how they became endangered.
Explanation E: E. This information suggests that fish of the endangered species in Lockeport cannot profitably be sold. It does not cast doubt on the argument made in favor of the proposed requirement. Neither does it cast doubt on the practicality or the desirability of the proposed requirement.

### Context:
Normally, the pineal gland governs a person’s sleep-wake cycle by secreting melatonin in response to the daily cycle of light and darkness as detected by the eye. Nonetheless, many people who are totally blind due to lesions in the visual cortex of the brain easily maintain a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle.

C: C. Whether melatonin is the only substance secreted by the pineal gland
D: D. Whether most people who do not have a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle nevertheless have a cycle of consistent duration
E: E. Whether there are any people with normal vision whose melatonin levels respond abnormally to periods of light and darkness Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Normally, a person’s sleep-wake cycle is governed by the pineal gland secreting melatonin in response to the daily cycle of light and darkness as detected by the eye. Yet many people who are totally blind due to lesions of the visual cortex easily maintain a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle.
### Reasoning: 
 What additional information would be most helpful in evaluating the argument? The argument’s conclusion is that the neural pathway by which the pineal gland receives information probably does not pass through the visual cortex. This is suggested by the fact that people without a well-functioning visual cortex (e.g., people with a certain type of blindness) can nonetheless maintain a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. Is it by the pineal gland’s secretion of melatonin that they do so? The argument tells us that normally (i.e., in sighted people), this is the mechanism for sleep regulation. But the argument depends on assuming that a similar mechanism is operating in people who are blind but have well-regulated sleep cycles. The best choice will be the one that helps us decide whether that assumption is correct.
Explanation A: A. This question would not give us an answer that would help in evaluating the argument. A “no” answer would not clarify whether the pineal gland–melatonin mechanism operates in people who are blind. A “yes” answer would do no better. The question refers only to people who have sleep dysfunctions (which the argument does not address).
Explanation B: B. Correct. Answering this question would provide the most useful information for evaluating the argument. A “yes” answer would help confirm a key assumption of the argument: that blind people rely on the pineal gland-melatonin mechanism for sleep regulation. A “no” answer would help disconfirm that assumption.
Explanation C: C. Whether or not there are other substances secreted by the pineal gland makes no difference to the reasoning. The argument relies on the premise that the pineal gland governs the sleep cycle by secreting melatonin. For example, if the pineal gland sometimes secreted adrenaline, that would still have no bearing on the argument.
Explanation D: D. The consistency or inconsistency of the duration of some people’s sleep patterns has no relevance to the reasoning. Their sleep patterns could be due to any of a number of factors.
Explanation E: E. This does not help, for there could be sighted people whose melatonin levels respond abnormally simply because of a pineal-gland abnormality.

### Context:
In countries where automobile insurance includes compensation for whiplash injuries sustained in automobile accidents, reports of having suffered such injuries are twice as frequent as they are in countries where whiplash is not covered. Presently, no objective test for whiplash exists, so it is true that spurious reports of whiplash injuries cannot be readily identified. Nevertheless, these facts do not warrant the conclusion drawn by some commentators that in the countries with the higher rates of reported whiplash injuries, half of the reported cases are spurious. Clearly, in countries where automobile insurance does not include compensation for whiplash, people often have little incentive to report whiplash injuries that they actually have suffered.

### Question:
In the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first is a claim that the argument disputes; the second is a conclusion that has been based on that claim.
B: B. The first is a claim that has been used to support a conclusion that the argument accepts; the second is that conclusion.
C: C. The first is evidence that has been used to support a conclusion for which the argument provides further evidence; the second is the main conclusion of the argument.
D: D. The first is a finding whose implications are at issue in the argument; the second is a claim presented in order to argue against deriving certain implications from that finding.
E: E. The first is a finding whose accuracy is evaluated in the argument; the second is evidence presented to establish that the finding is accurate. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Reported whiplash injuries are twice as common in countries where car insurance companies pay compensation for such injuries as they are in countries where insurance companies do not. Although there is no objective test for whiplash, this does not mean, as some suggest, that half of the reports of such injuries are fake. It could simply be that where insurance will not pay for such injuries, people are less inclined to report them.
### Reasoning: 
 What roles do the two boldfaced portions play in the argument? The first portion tells us about the correlation between reported cases of whiplash in countries and the willingness of insurance companies in those countries to compensate for whiplash injuries. The argument next states that whiplash is difficult to verify objectively. The argument then asserts that although this last fact, taken together with the first boldfaced portion, has led some to infer that over half of the reported cases in countries with the highest whiplash rates are spurious, such an inference is unwarranted. The second boldfaced portion then helps to explain, by offering an alternative explanation, why such an inference is not necessarily warranted.
Explanation A: A. The claim made in the first boldfaced portion is never disputed in the argument. The second is not the argument’s conclusion.
Explanation B: B. Perhaps the argument uses the first portion to support its conclusion, but there is no indication that it has been used elsewhere to do so. Regardless, the second boldfaced portion is not the argument’s conclusion.
Explanation C: C. The first portion has been used to support a conclusion that the argument rejects; the second portion is not the argument’s conclusion.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This answer choice correctly identifies the roles played in the argument by the boldfaced portions. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the first boldfaced portion tells us about the correlation between reported cases of whiplash in countries and the willingness of insurance companies in those countries to compensate for whiplash injuries. This is presented as a fact whose implications are at issue in the ensuing portions of the passage. The argument then reports that this fact, considered together with the difficulty of proving whiplash injuries, has led some to infer that over half of the reported cases in countries with the highest whiplash rates are spurious. The conclusion of the argument is that this inference is unwarranted. The second boldfaced portion expresses the basis for the argument’s conclusion: there is a reasonable alternative explanation for the differences in frequency of whiplash injury reports between the two types of countries.
Explanation E: E. The accuracy of the first boldfaced portion is never questioned in the argument, nor is the second intended to somehow help show that the first is accurate. Rather, the argument assumes that the first portion is accurate.

### Context:
Last year Comfort Airlines had twice as many delayed flights as the year before, but the number of complaints from passengers about delayed flights went up three times. It is unlikely that this disproportionate increase in complaints was rooted in an increase in overall dissatisfaction with the service Comfort Airlines provides, since the airline made a special effort to improve other aspects of its service last year. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the disproportionate increase in

### Question:
customer complaints?
A: A. Comfort Airlines had more flights last year than the year before.
B: B. Last year a single period of unusually bad weather caused a large number of flights to be delayed.
C: C. Some of the improvements that Comfort Airlines made in its service were required by new government regulations.
D: D. The average length of a flight delay was greater last year than it was the year before.
E: E. The average number of passengers per flight was no higher last year than the year before. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
situation should have reduced the number of passenger complaints per delayed flight, since many passengers should have realized that the unusually bad weather was not the airline’s fault.
### Reasoning: 
 What could explain why the number of complaints about delayed flights increased disproportionately to the number of delayed flights last year? In other words, why did the average number of passenger complaints per delayed flight go up last year? One obvious possibility is that the average number of passengers per delayed flight was greater last year than it had been the year before. Another is that the flight delays tended to cause worse problems for passengers last year than they had the year before, so that on average each delay was more upsetting for the passengers.
Explanation A: A. This helps explain why the airline had more delayed flights last year, but not why the increase in complaints about delayed flights was disproportionate to the increase in delayed flights.
Explanation B: B. This helps explain why the airline had more delayed flights last year. But, if anything, the
Explanation C: C. If any of the improvements concerned handling of flight delays, for example, and passengers were aware that government regulations addressed this, then passengers might have complained more than previously. But the information we are given here is too general and too vague to explain the disproportionate increase in complaints.
Explanation D: D. Correct. Longer flight delays would have more severely inconvenienced passengers and thus would probably have generated more passenger complaints per delay.
Explanation E: E. This rules out the possibility that an increased number of passengers per delayed flight could have caused the disproportionate increase in the number of complaints about delayed flights. But no alternative explanation is offered.

### Context:
Last year a global disturbance of weather patterns disrupted harvests in many of the world’s important agricultural areas. Worldwide production of soybeans, an important source of protein for people and livestock alike, was not adversely affected, however. Indeed, last year’s soybean crop was actually slightly larger than average. Nevertheless, the weather phenomenon is probably responsible for a recent increase in the world price of soybeans. Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest justification for the attribution of the

### Question:
increase in soybean prices to the weather phenomenon?
A: A. Last year’s harvest of anchovies, which provide an important protein source for livestock, was disrupted by the effects of the weather phenomenon.
B: B. Most countries that produce soybeans for export had above-average harvests of a number of food crops other than soybeans last year.
C: C. The world price of soybeans also rose several years ago, immediately after an earlier occurrence of a similar global weather disturbance.
D: D. Heavy rains attributable to the weather phenomenon improved grazing pastures last year, allowing farmers in many parts of the world to reduce their dependence on supplemental feed.
E: E. Prior to last year, soybean prices had been falling for several years. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A weather disturbance last year disrupted harvests worldwide but did not reduce production of soybeans, a protein source for both people and livestock. Soybean prices increased nonetheless, likely a result of the weather.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence would suggest that the weather disturbance caused the increase in soybean prices even though it did not reduce soybean production? Prices tend to increase when the supply of a product falls relative to the demand for the product. But the production of soybeans did not fall. Evidence that the weather disturbance either hindered the global distribution of soybeans or increased global demand for soybeans could support the claim that the weather disturbance caused the increase in soybean prices.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If the weather disturbance reduced the anchovy harvest, and anchovies provide protein for livestock just as soybeans do, then more soybeans for livestock feed would be needed to compensate for the lack of anchovies. The resulting increase in demand for soybeans could thus have increased global soybean prices.
Explanation B: B. This is not surprising, given that the weather disturbance did not severely affect the soybean-producing countries, but it does not explain how the weather disturbance could have caused soybean prices to increase.
Explanation C: C. The rise in soybean prices after the earlier weather disturbance could easily have been a coincidence. Or, unlike last year’s disturbance, the earlier disturbance could have reduced soybean production.
Explanation D: D. This suggests that demand for soybeans should have fallen as a result of the weather disturbance, so it does not explain why soybean prices rose.
Explanation E: E. If soybean prices were unusually low for some temporary reason when the weather disturbance occurred, they might have been likely to rise back to normal levels even without the weather disturbance.

### Context:
Most of the year, the hermit thrush, a North American songbird, eats a diet consisting mainly of insects, but in autumn, as the thrushes migrate to their Central and South American wintering grounds, they feed almost exclusively on wild berries. Wild berries, however, are not as rich in calories as insects, yet thrushes need to consume plenty of calories in order to complete their migration. One possible explanation is that berries contain other nutrients that thrushes need for migration and that insects lack. Which of the following, if true, most seriously calls into question the explanation given for the

### Question:
thrush’s diet during migration?
A: A. Hermit thrushes, if undernourished, are unable to complete their autumn migration before the onset of winter.
B: B. Insect species contain certain nutrients that are not found in wild berries.
C: C. For songbirds, catching insects requires the expenditure of significantly more calories than eating wild berries does.
D: D. Along the hermit thrushes’ migration routes, insects are abundant throughout the migration season.
E: E. There are some species of wild berries that hermit thrushes generally do not eat, even though these berry species are exceptionally rich in calories. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Hermit thrushes are songbirds that usually eat insects but switch to eating berries when migrating. The thrushes need lots of calories to migrate, but berries contain fewer calories than insects do. Perhaps the berries contain nutrients that insects do not provide.
### Reasoning: 
 What would cast doubt on the claim that the thrushes switch to berries because berries contain nutrients that insects lack and that the thrushes need for their migration? Evidence that berries do not contain such nutrients or that thrushes do not decrease their net calorie consumption by eating berries would cast doubt on the proposed explanation. So would any evidence that supported an alternative explanation for the diet change during migration— for example, seasonal or regional differences in the amount or quality of berries or insects available for the thrushes to consume.
Explanation A: A. Even if thrushes need to be well-nourished to finish migrating before winter, extra nutrients found in berries but not insects might help provide the nourishment they need.
Explanation B: B. Even if insects contain certain nutrients not found in wild berries, those specific nutrients may not be the ones the thrushes need for their migration.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This suggests that the thrushes might gain more net calories from eating berries than from eating insects, which could explain why they switch to eating berries even if the berries contain no extra nutrients.
Explanation D: D. By ruling out a lack of insects to eat while migrating as an alternative explanation for why the thrushes switch to eating berries, this would support the proposed explanation.
Explanation E: E. The calorie-rich species of berries the thrushes do not eat might be poisonous or indigestible for them, even if the species of berries the thrushes do eat contain nutrients they need to migrate.

### Context:
The kinds of hand and wrist injuries that result from extended use of a computer while maintaining an incorrect posture are common among schoolchildren in Harnville. Computers are important to the school curriculum there, so instead of reducing the amount their students use computers, teachers plan to bring about a sharp reduction in the number of these injuries by carefully monitoring their students’ posture when using computers in the classroom. Which of the following would it be most useful to know in order to assess the likelihood that

### Question:

D: D. Whether changes in the curriculum could reduce the schools’ dependence on computers
E: E. What proportion of schoolchildren in Harnville already use correct posture while using a computer Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Hand and wrist injuries from using computers while maintaining poor posture are common among schoolchildren in Harnville. Teachers plan to greatly reduce the number of such injuries by monitoring their students’ posture while the students use computers in the classroom.
### Reasoning: 
 What would be most helpful to know to determine the likelihood that the teachers’ plan will succeed? The primary concern is the posture students adopt while using computers. To succeed, the teachers’ plan must reduce the time students spend with poor posture while using computers and reduce it enough to greatly reduce the number of injuries. To know how likely this is, it would help to know how effectively the teachers will be able to monitor and improve their students’ posture inside the classroom. But how many of the students use computers outside of school while maintaining poor posture, and how often do they do so? If many students do so quite often, they may develop hand and wrist injuries regardless of what happens in school.
Explanation A: A. The teachers do not plan to reduce any injuries other than hand and wrist injuries, so whether computer use with poor posture causes any such other injuries is irrelevant to the likelihood that their plan will produce its intended effect.
Explanation B: B. The plan being discussed concerns only the reduction of hand and wrist injuries caused specifically by computer use with poor posture, so the frequency of hand and wrist injuries from other causes is irrelevant to the likelihood that the plan will produce its intended effect.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If the students’ school use of computers is a large part of their overall computer use, any retraining that accompanies the monitoring might have some effect on their posture and related injury rates overall. However, the greater the proportion of children with hand and wrist injuries who use computers extensively outside the classroom, the more children are likely to keep developing the injuries regardless of any monitoring at school, so the less effective the teachers’ plan involving only computer use at school is likely to be.
Explanation D: D. Knowing whether this is the case might help in developing a potential alternative to the teachers’ plan, but if it did, this would not help significantly toward assessing the likelihood that the actual plan will succeed. The teachers’ actual plan involves monitoring computer use in school without reducing such use. Other possible means of achieving the plan’s goal are not part of the plan and are therefore irrelevant to the likelihood that the teachers’ actual plan will succeed.
Explanation E: E. The passage indicates that the proportion of the schoolchildren maintaining poor posture while using computers is high enough for many to develop hand and wrist injuries as a result. Whatever the exact proportion is, the teachers’ plan may or may not succeed in reducing it.

### Context:
A certain cultivated herb is one of a group of closely related plants that thrive in soil with high concentrations of metals that are toxic to most other plants. Agronomists studying the growth of this herb have discovered that it produces large amounts of histidine, an amino acid that, in test-tube solutions, renders these metals chemically inert. Hence, the herb’s high histidine production must be the key feature that allows it to grow in metal-rich soils.

### Question:
In evaluating the argument, it would be most important to determine which of the following?
A: A. Whether the herb can thrive in soil that does not have high concentrations of the toxic metals
B: B. Whether others of the closely related group of plants also produce histidine in large quantities
C: C. Whether the herb’s high level of histidine production is associated with an unusually low level of production of some other amino acid
D: D. Whether growing the herb in soil with high concentrations of the metals will, over time, reduce their concentrations in the soil
E: E. Whether the concentration of histidine in the growing herb declines as the plant approaches maturity Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A certain herb and closely related species thrive in soil full of metals toxic to most plants. The herb produces much histidine, which makes those metals chemically inert. Histidine production, therefore, is largely what accounts for the herb’s thriving in metal-rich soils.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence would help determine whether the herb’s histidine production is what enables it to thrive in metal-rich soils? The argument is that since the herb’s histidine chemically neutralizes the metals that are toxic to most plants, it must explain why the herb can thrive in metal-rich soils. To evaluate this argument, it would be helpful to know about the relationship between other closely related plant species’ histidine production and the ability to thrive in metal-rich soils. It would also be helpful to know about any other factors that might plausibly explain why the herb can thrive in those soils.
Explanation A: A. Whether or not the herb thrives in metal-free soils, histidine production could enable it to thrive in soils that contain toxic metals.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If the closely related plants do not produce much histidine, whatever other factor allows them to thrive in metal-rich soils would likely account for why the herb thrives in those soils as well.
Explanation C: C. The given information suggests no particular reason to suppose that a low level of some unspecified amino acid would enable a plant to thrive in metal-rich soils.
Explanation D: D. The herb might absorb metals from any metal-rich soil it grows in, regardless of why it thrives in that soil.
Explanation E: E. Whether or not histidine concentrations in the herb decline as it approaches maturity, there could still be enough histidine in the growing herb to neutralize the metals and explain why it can grow in metal-rich soil.

### Context:
Many people suffer an allergic reaction to certain sulfites, including those that are commonly added to wine as preservatives. However, since there are several winemakers who add sulfites to none of the wines they produce, people who would like to drink wine but are allergic to sulfites can drink wines produced by these winemakers without risking an allergic reaction to sulfites.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A: A. These winemakers have been able to duplicate the preservative effect produced by adding sulfites by means that do not involve adding any potentially allergenic substances to their wine.
B: B. Not all forms of sulfite are equally likely to produce the allergic reaction.
C: C. Wine is the only beverage to which sulfites are commonly added.
D: D. Apart from sulfites, there are no substances commonly present in wine that give rise to an allergic reaction.
E: E. Sulfites are not naturally present in the wines produced by these winemakers in amounts large enough to produce an allergic reaction in someone who drinks these wines. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 People who are allergic to certain sulfites can avoid risking an allergic reaction by drinking wine from one of the several producers that does not add sulfites.
### Reasoning: 
 On what assumption does the argument depend? Drinking wine to which no sulfites have been added will not prevent exposure to sulfites if, for instance, sulfites occur naturally in wines. In particular, if the wines that do not have sulfites added have sulfites present naturally in quantities sufficient to produce an allergic reaction, drinking these wines will not result in an allergic reaction. The argument therefore depends on assuming that this is not the case.
Explanation A: A. The argument does not require this because the conclusion does not address allergic reactions to substances other than sulfites.
Explanation B: B. The argument specifically refers to “certain sulfites” producing allergic reactions. It is entirely compatible with certain other forms of sulfites not producing allergic reactions in anyone.
Explanation C: C. This is irrelevant. The argument does not claim that one can avoid having an allergic reaction to sulfites from any source just by restricting one’s wine consumption to those varieties to which no sulfites have been added.
Explanation D: D. Once again, the argument’s conclusion does not address allergic reactions to substances other than sulfites in wine.
Explanation E: E. Correct. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the argument relies on the assumption that sulfites are not naturally present, in quantities sufficient to cause allergic reactions, in the wines to which no sulfites are added. If this assumption is not made, then the fact that no sulfites are added to certain wines is not a good reason to believe that people with sulfite allergies who consume the wines will not have an allergic reaction; if there are enough sulfites that naturally occur in the wine, people who consume the wine may well have an allergic reaction despite the fact that no sulfites have been added.

E: E. Logos University is unlikely to attract corporate sponsorship of its scientific research. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Universities own the patents resulting from government-sponsored research at their institutions. One university plans to sell its patents to corporations and use the proceeds to fund a program to improve teaching.
### Reasoning: 
 What would cast doubt on the university’s plan? The plan assumes that the university has been granted, and/or will be granted, patents for its inventions; that there will be a market for its patents; and that corporations will want to buy them. What might make this untrue? For example, the university’s inventions might have no practical value or might be useful only for government agencies, and if some of the corporations have already done the same or similar research, they will likely not be prospective buyers of the university’s patents.
Explanation A: A. This point is irrelevant to the plan to sell patents in order to fund a program.
Explanation B: B. The university plans to sell the patents to the corporations, not to invite the corporations to sponsor research.
Explanation C: C. This point is irrelevant to the university’s plan to sell off patents since the plan does not specify that the research scientists will be involved in the programs to improve undergraduate teaching.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This statement properly identifies a factor that casts doubt on the university’s plan. The plan presupposes that corporations will want to buy the rights to the inventions. If some of the corporations have already done the same or similar research, they would likely have developed ways of achieving what the university’s inventions promise to achieve. In the case of potential future patents, they might even have already patented the inventions that the university would develop, in which case the university would be unable to patent them. Or the corporations might have developed similar, but not identical, inventions that serve the same purpose. In such cases, they probably would not need the university’s inventions.
Explanation E: E. The plan concerns selling patents resulting from government-sponsored research, not attracting corporate sponsorship for research.

Since it has become known that several of a bank’s top executives have been buying shares in their own bank, the bank’s depositors, who had been worried by rumors that the bank faced impending financial collapse, have been greatly relieved. They reason that, since top executives evidently have faith in the bank’s financial soundness, those worrisome rumors must be false.

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Top executives at a bank that has been rumored to be in financial trouble have been buying shares in the bank. Bank depositors see this as a good sign, because they believe that it indicates that the executives have faith in the bank. However, corporate executives sometimes do this just to dispel rumors about a company’s health.
### Reasoning: 
 What is the role that the two boldfaced portions play in the argument? The first boldfaced portion states that bank executives are buying bank shares, which the passage indicates is taken by bank depositors to be evidence of the executives’ faith in the bank; in other words, the bank depositors take the fact that the executives are buying shares in the bank as supporting the conclusion that the executives have faith in the bank and thus that the rumors that the bank is facing financial collapse are wrong. The passage then tells us what some have inferred from this (namely, that worrisome rumors about the bank’s impending financial collapse are false). Finally, the passage offers in the second boldfaced portion evidence that undermines this inference: corporate executives have sometimes bought shares in their own companies just to dispel negative rumors, presumably whether the rumors are true or not.
Explanation A: A. Correct. This option correctly identifies the roles played by the boldfaced portions. As discussed in the Reasoning section above, the bank depositors have drawn the conclusion from the first boldfaced portion that the bank’s finances are sound, but the second boldfaced portion is presented to call their conclusion into question.
Explanation B: B. This correctly describes the first portion’s role, but the second portion is not offered as a conclusion—no evidence is given for it; rather, it is evidence for something else.
Explanation C: C. The second portion is not offered as a conclusion; no evidence is given for it.
Explanation D: D. The second portion is not itself offered as an explanation of why these bank executives are investing in the bank; if it were, that would mean that the bank executives are doing so because corporate executives are known to do such things in a calculated effort to dispel worries. Furthermore, the argument does not conclude that this other explanation (which the boldfaced portion points to) is correct, only that the one inferred by depositors may not be.
Explanation E: E. The argument is not so much seeking to establish an explanation of its own as it is trying to undermine that inferred by the depositors.

Between 1980 and 2000, the sea otter population of the Aleutian Islands declined precipitously. There were no signs of disease or malnutrition, so there was probably an increase in the number of otters being eaten by predators. Orcas will eat otters when seals, their normal prey, are unavailable, and the Aleutian Islands seal population declined dramatically in the 1980s. Therefore, orcas were most likely the immediate cause of the otter population decline.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
A: A. The population of sea urchins, the main food of sea otters, has increased since the sea otter population declined.
B: B. Seals do not eat sea otters, nor do they compete with sea otters for food.
C: C. Most of the surviving sea otters live in a bay that is inaccessible to orcas.
D: D. The population of orcas in the Aleutian Islands has declined since the 1980s.
E: E. An increase in commercial fishing near the Aleutian Islands in the 1980s caused a slight decline in the population of the fish that seals use for food. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A sea otter population declined even though there were no signs of disease or malnutrition. The local seal population also declined. Orcas eat otters when seals are unavailable, and thus are probably the cause of the decline in the otter population.
### Reasoning: 
 What would be evidence that predation by orcas reduced the sea otter population? Disease and malnutrition are ruled out as alternative explanations of the decline in the sea otter population. The argument could be further strengthened by casting doubt on other possible explanations, such as predation by other animals, or by presenting observations that predation of otters by orcas would help to explain.
Explanation A: A. Regardless of whether or not orcas ate the sea otters, the sea urchin population would most likely have increased when the population of sea otters preying on them decreased.
Explanation B: B. Because the seal population declined during the initial years of the otter population decline, predation by and competition with seals were already implausible explanations of the otter population decline.
Explanation C: C. Correct. Orcas eating most of the accessible otters could plausibly explain this observation, which therefore provides additional evidence that orca predation reduced the sea otter population.
Explanation D: D. If the orca population declined at the same time as the sea otter population, it would be less likely that increasing predation by orcas reduced the otter population.
Explanation E: E. Since the sea otters showed no signs of malnutrition, they were probably getting enough fish. But if they were not, commercial fishing rather than orcas might have caused the otter population decline.

### Context:
Political strategist: The domestic policies of our opponents in Party X are contrary to the priorities of many middle-class voters. Yet some of these same voters are supporters of Party X and its candidates due to the party’s appeals about foreign policy. In order to win these voters back, we in Party Y must prove to middle-class voters that Party X does not represent their priorities with respect to domestic policy. Which of the following would, if true, most strongly suggest that the political strategist’s plan

### Question:
is unlikely to succeed?
A: A. Many in the middle class who support Party X for its foreign policies also support its domestic policies and are fully aware of the implications of those policies.
B: B. Most middle-class supporters of Party X care about foreign policy and know very little about its domestic policies.
C: C. Long-term domestic policy sometimes conflicts with short-term domestic policy.
D: D. There are topics on which Party X and Party Y have significant agreement.
E: E. Some middle-class voters are concerned about both domestic and foreign policy. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A political strategist for Party Y notes that the domestic policies of Party X are contrary to the priorities of middle-class voters. Many middle-class voters nonetheless support Party X because of its foreign policy. The strategist argues that to win these voters back, Party Y should prove to middle-class voters that Party X’s domestic policies do not represent their priorities.
### Reasoning: 
 What claim would most strongly suggest that the strategist’s plan will not succeed? Suppose that a large number of the middle-class voters who support Party X’s foreign policies also support its domestic policies, despite the fact that the domestic policies are contrary to their priorities. If that were true, then Party Y might well be unable to win back these voters by following the strategist’s plan.
Explanation A: A. Correct. As noted above, if many middle-class voters who support Party X’s foreign policies also support its domestic policies, the strategy of attempting to show these voters that there is a conflict between their priorities and Party X’s domestic policies may well fail to get them to vote for Party Y. Presumably, these voters are aware of the conflict and support Party X nonetheless—perhaps because Party Y’s domestic policies conflict with their priorities even more.
Explanation B: B. If most middle-class supporters of Party X know little about its domestic policies, Party Y may well be able to win them back simply by showing them the inconsistencies between those policies and their own priorities.
Explanation C: C. A conflict between long-term domestic policy and short-term domestic policy tells us nothing about whether educating middle-class voters about conflicts between their priorities and Party X’s domestic policies would help win them back to Party Y.
Explanation D: D. The fact that the two parties have significant agreement on certain topics does not suggest the strategist’s plan will not succeed. In fact, if the parties agreed on very little, the strategy of pointing only to issues related to domestic policy might be less likely to work. Therefore, this answer choice helps rule out a reason for thinking that the plan might not work.
Explanation E: E. If anything, this would help support the claim that the strategist’s plan will succeed.

### Context:
Studies in restaurants show that the tips left by customers who pay their bill in cash tend to be larger when the bill is presented on a tray that bears a credit-card logo. Consumer psychologists hypothesize that simply seeing a credit-card logo makes many credit-card holders willing to spend more because it reminds them that their spending power exceeds the cash they have immediately available. Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the psychologists’ interpretation of the

### Question:
studies?
A: A. The effect noted in the studies is not limited to patrons who have credit cards.
B: B. Patrons who are under financial pressure from their credit-card obligations tend to tip less when presented with a restaurant bill on a tray with a credit-card logo than when the tray has no logo.
C: C. In virtually all of the cases in the studies, the patrons who paid bills in cash did not possess credit cards.
D: D. In general, restaurant patrons who pay their bills in cash leave larger tips than do those who pay by credit card.
E: E. The percentage of restaurant bills paid with a given brand of credit card increases when that credit card’s logo is displayed on the tray with which the bill is presented. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Studies have found that restaurant customers give more generous tips when their bills are brought on trays bearing a credit-card logo. Psychologists speculate that this is because the logo reminds customers of their ability to spend more money than they have.
### Reasoning: 
 Which of the options most helps to support the psychologists’ explanation of the studies? The psychologists’ hypothesis is that the credit-card logos on the trays bring to the minds of those who tip more the fact that they have more purchasing power than merely the cash that they have at hand. This explanation would not be valid even if those people who are not reminded of their own excess purchasing power—if in fact they have any such power— when they see such a logo nonetheless tip more in such trays. Thus, if restaurant patrons who are under financial pressure from their credit-card obligations do not tip more when their bills are presented on trays bearing credit-card logos, then the psychologists’ interpretation of the studies is supported.
Explanation A: A. This undermines the psychologists’ interpretation, for it shows that the same phenomenon occurs even when the alleged cause has been removed.
Explanation B: B. Correct. If the consumer psychologists’ hypothesis is true, it implies that only those who do, in fact, have additional spending power in the form of credit will be influenced by the logos to leave larger tips. If those who do not have such additional spending power are influenced in the same way, the hypothesis is flawed. Answer choice B indicates that the hypothesis is not flawed in this way, so it thereby tends to strengthen the hypothesis. It also strengthens the hypothesis by weakening some alternative hypotheses such as the following: Most of the customers who pay with cash do so because they have excessive credit-card debt and cannot use a credit card. However, seeing a credit-card logo makes them wonder whether credit-card customers may leave larger tips, and to avoid displeasing the server by leaving a small tip, they decide to leave a larger tip than they might otherwise have done.
Explanation C: C. This undermines the psychologists’ interpretation by showing that the same phenomenon occurs even when the alleged cause has been removed; patrons cannot be reminded of something that is not there.
Explanation D: D. To the extent that this bears on the interpretation of the study, it weakens it. Patrons using credit cards are surely aware that they have credit, and yet they spend less generously.
Explanation E: E. This does not support the idea that being reminded that one has a credit card induces one to be more generous, only that it induces one to use that credit card.

### Context:
In an experiment, each volunteer was allowed to choose between an easy task and a hard task and was told that another volunteer would do the other task. Each volunteer could also choose to have a computer assign the two tasks randomly. Most volunteers chose the easy task for themselves and under questioning later said they had acted fairly. But when the scenario was described to another group of volunteers, almost all said choosing the easy task would be unfair. This shows that most people apply weaker moral standards to themselves than to others.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption required by this argument?
A: A. At least some volunteers who said they had acted fairly in choosing the easy task would have said that it was unfair for someone else to do so.
B: B. The most moral choice for the volunteers would have been to have the computer assign the two tasks randomly.
C: C. There were at least some volunteers who were assigned to do the hard task and felt that the assignment was unfair.
D: D. On average, the volunteers to whom the scenario was described were more accurate in their moral judgments than the other volunteers were.
E: E. At least some volunteers given the choice between assigning the tasks themselves and having the computer assign them felt that they had made the only fair choice available to them. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 In an experiment, most volunteers chose to do an easy task themselves and leave a hard task for someone else. They later said they had acted fairly, but almost all volunteers in another group to which the scenario was described said choosing the easy task would be unfair, indicating that most people apply weaker moral standards to themselves.
### Reasoning: 
 What must be true in order for the facts presented to support the conclusion that most people apply weaker moral standards to themselves than to others? One set of volunteers said they had acted fairly in taking the easy task, whereas different volunteers said that doing so would be unfair. In neither case did any of the volunteers actually judge their own behavior differently from how they judged anyone else’s. So, the argument implicitly infers from the experimental results that most of the volunteers would judge their own behavior differently from someone else’s if given the chance. This inference assumes that the volunteers in the second group would have applied the same moral standards that those in the first group did if they had been in the first group’s position, and vice versa.
Explanation A: A. Correct. If none of the volunteers who said their own behavior was fair would have judged someone else’s similar behavior as unfair, then their relaxed moral judgment of themselves would not suggest that they applied weaker moral standards to themselves than to others.
Explanation B: B. Even if this is so, the experimental results could still suggest that the volunteers would apply weaker moral standards to themselves than to others.
Explanation C: C. The argument would be equally strong even if volunteers who were assigned the hard task did not know that someone else had gotten an easier task—or even if no volunteers were actually assigned the hard task at all.
Explanation D: D. Even if the moral standards applied by the volunteers who judged themselves were as accurate as those applied by the volunteers to whom the scenario was described, the former standards were still weaker.
Explanation E: E. Even if all the volunteers in the first group had felt that all the choices available to them would have been fair for them to make personally, they might have applied stricter moral standards to someone else in the same position.

### Context:
Country X’s recent stock-trading scandal should not diminish investors’ confidence in the country’s stock market. For one thing, the discovery of the scandal confirms that Country X has a strong regulatory system, as the following considerations show. In any stock market, some fraudulent activity is inevitable. If a stock market is well regulated, any significant stock- trading fraud in it will very likely be discovered. This deters potential perpetrators and facilitates improvement in regulatory processes.

### Question:
In the argument, the portion in boldface plays which of the following roles?
A: A. It is the argument’s only conclusion.
B: B. It is a conclusion for which the argument provides support and which itself is used to support the argument’s main conclusion.
C: C. It is the argument’s main conclusion and is supported by another explicitly stated conclusion for which further support is provided.
D: D. It is an assumption for which no explicit support is provided and is used to support the argument’s only conclusion.
E: E. It is a compound statement containing both the argument’s main conclusion and an assumption used to support that conclusion. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Country X recently had a stock-trading scandal.
### Reasoning: 
 What role does the statement that the scandal’s discovery confirms that Country X has a strong regulatory system play in the argument? In the sentence containing the boldfaced statement, the phrase For one thing indicates that the statement is being used to justify the claim in the preceding sentence. Thus, the boldfaced statement must support that preceding sentence as a conclusion. Directly after the boldfaced statement, the phrase as the following considerations show indicates that the subsequent sentences are being used to support the boldfaced statement. Thus, the boldfaced statement is a conclusion supported by the sentences following it, and this statement itself supports the sentence preceding it, which must be the argument’s main conclusion.
Explanation A: A. As explained above, the boldfaced statement supports the claim in the preceding sentence, so it cannot be the argument’s only conclusion.
Explanation B: B. Correct. As explained above, the boldfaced statement is supported by the statements following it and in turn is used to support the argument’s main conclusion in the statement preceding it.
Explanation C: C. As explained above, the boldfaced statement cannot be the argument’s main conclusion, because it supports a further conclusion presented in the sentence preceding it.
Explanation D: D. As explained above, the sentences following the boldfaced statement are the explicit support provided for it.
Explanation E: E. As explained above, the argument’s main conclusion is stated only in the first sentence, which precedes the boldfaced statement. It is not repeated anywhere in the boldfaced statement.

### Context:
Delta Products Inc  has recently switched at least partly from older technologies using fossil fuels to new technologies powered by electricity. The question has been raised whether it can be concluded that, for a given level of output, Delta’s operation now causes less fossil fuel to be consumed than it did formerly. The answer, clearly, is yes, since the amount of fossil fuel used to generate the electricity needed to power the new technologies is less than the amount needed to power the older technologies, provided level of output is held constant.

### Question:
In the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first identifies the content of the conclusion of the argument; the second provides support for that conclusion.
B: B. The first provides support for the conclusion of the argument; the second identifies the content of that conclusion.
C: C. The first states the conclusion of the argument; the second calls that conclusion into question.
D: D. The first provides support for the conclusion of the argument; the second calls that conclusion into question.
E: E. Each provides support for the conclusion of the argument. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Delta switched from technologies using fossil fuels to ones using electricity. It has been asked whether this results in less fossil fuel used per level of output. The answer is that it does.
### Reasoning: 
 What roles do the two boldfaced portions play in the argument? The first boldfaced statement is simply asserted by the passage; no premise, or reason, is given to support it. But the second boldfaced statement, when it is first introduced, is not asserted to be true, but rather is identified as something that might be inferred from the first statement. By the end of the passage, the argument concludes that the second statement is true.
Explanation A: A. This option simply reverses the roles that the statements play in the argument.
Explanation B: B. Correct. This option identifies the roles the boldfaced portions play: The second statement is not, on its own, the conclusion, because the argument initially merely asks whether it can be concluded on the basis of the first statement—that is, it asks whether the first boldfaced statement provides support for it. The conclusion of the argument is actually the statement The answer, clearly, is yes. The word yes is elliptical for Yes, it can be concluded that for a given level of output, Delta’s operation now causes less fossil fuel to be consumed than it did formerly. The boldfaced portion tells us what can be concluded, and thus it can accurately be described as the content of the conclusion.
Explanation C: C. Nothing in the passage is intended to support the first statement, and the second statement is not supposed to call the first into question.
Explanation D: D. This correctly identifies the role of the first statement, but the second boldfaced portion does not call the argument’s conclusion into question—it is part of a sentence that refers to the question whether that conclusion can be drawn from the first statement.
Explanation E: E. Again, this is only half right. The second boldfaced portion is not offered as support for the conclusion; if it were offered as such support, the argument would be guilty of circular reasoning, since the second boldfaced portion states exactly what the argument concludes.

### Context:
A product that represents a clear technological advance over competing products can generally command a high price. Because technological advances tend to be quickly surpassed and companies want to make large profits while they still can, many companies charge the greatest price the market will bear when they have such a product. But large profits on the new product will give competitors a strong incentive to quickly match the new product’s capabilities. Consequently, the strategy to maximize overall profit from a new product is to charge less than the greatest possible price.

### Question:
In the argument above, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first is an assumption that forms the basis for a course of action that the argument criticizes; the second presents the course of action endorsed by the argument.
B: B. The first is a consideration raised to explain the appeal of a certain strategy; the second is a consideration raised to call into question the wisdom of adopting that strategy.
C: C. The first is an assumption that has been used to justify a certain strategy; the second is a consideration that is used to cast doubt on that assumption.
D: D. The first is a consideration raised in support of a strategy the argument endorses; the second presents grounds in support of that consideration.
E: E. The first is a consideration raised to show that adopting a certain strategy is unlikely to achieve the intended effect; the second is presented to explain the appeal of that strategy. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Companies generally charge the greatest price the market will bear when they have a product that represents a technological advance. This is because they want to make large profits while they can. But making large profits inspires competition. As a result, profits can be maximized by charging less than the greatest price possible.
### Reasoning: 
 What logical roles do the two portions in boldface play in the argument? The first sentence of the passage introduces a connection between technological advances and price. The second sentence discusses a pricing strategy related to such advances and offers certain considerations that help explain that strategy. The first boldfaced portion of the passage, which is contained in the second sentence, presents one of these considerations. The third sentence begins with the word But, which suggests that what follows—the second boldfaced section—presents a consideration that may be at least superficially at odds with the strategy just described. The final sentence of the argument presents an alternative strategy that is supported by the preceding discussion.
Explanation A: A. The course of action endorsed by the argument is described in the passage’s fourth and final sentence, not in the second boldfaced portion, which is found in the passage’s third sentence.
Explanation B: B. Correct. The first boldfaced portion is part of an explanation of why many companies follow the strategy of charging as much as the market will bear when they have a product representing a technological advance. The second boldfaced portion gives a reason not to follow that strategy.
Explanation C: C. The second boldfaced portion does not cast doubt on an assumption used to justify a strategy, but rather casts doubt on the strategy itself.
Explanation D: D. The first boldfaced portion is raised in support of a strategy that the argument calls into question, not a strategy that the argument endorses.
Explanation E: E. The first boldfaced portion helps explain the appeal of adopting a certain strategy; it does not show that the strategy is likely to fail. The second boldfaced portion does not explain the appeal of the strategy, but rather calls the strategy into question.

### Context:
Theater critic: The play La Finestrina, now at Central Theater, was written in Italy in the eighteenth century. The director claims that this production is as similar to the original production as is possible in a modern theater. Although the actor who plays Harlequin the clown gives a performance very reminiscent of the twentieth-century American comedian Groucho Marx, Marx’s comic style was very much within the comic acting tradition that had begun in sixteenth-century Italy.

### Question:
The considerations given best serve as part of an argument that
A: A. modern audiences would find it hard to tolerate certain characteristics of a historically accurate performance of an eighteenth-century play
B: B. Groucho Marx once performed the part of the character Harlequin in La Finestrina
C: C. in the United States, the training of actors in the twentieth century is based on principles that do not differ radically from those that underlay the training of actors in eighteenth- century Italy
D: D. the performance of the actor who plays Harlequin in La Finestrina does not serve as evidence against the director’s claim
E: E. the director of La Finestrina must have advised the actor who plays Harlequin to model his performance on comic performances of Groucho Marx Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The director of the local production of La Finestrina says it is as similar to the original production as is possible in a modern theater. The actor playing Harlequin gives a performance reminiscent of Groucho Marx, whose comic style falls within an acting tradition which began in sixteenth-century Italy.
### Reasoning: 
 For which of the options would the consideration given best serve as an argument? The actor’s performance was reminiscent of someone who fell within a tradition going back to sixteenth-century Italy. The play was written, and therefore was likely first performed, in eighteenth-century Italy. All of this suggests that there could be a similarity between the performances of Harlequin in the local production and in the original production. While the two performances might have been quite dissimilar, there is nothing here that supports that.
Explanation A: A. Regardless of how plausible this option might be on its own merits, the passage provides no support for it because the passage provides no information about the characteristics of a historically accurate performance of an eighteenth-century play.
Explanation B: B. The passage neither says this nor implies it.
Explanation C: C. The passage says nothing about the training of actors, so this option would be supported by the passage only in a very roundabout, indirect way.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This is the option that the considerations most support.
Explanation E: E. That the performance reminded the theater critic of Groucho Marx hardly shows that the similarity was intentional, let alone that it was at the director’s instruction.

### Context:
Although the discount stores in Goreville’s central shopping district are expected to close within five years as a result of competition from a SpendLess discount department store that just opened, those locations will not stay vacant for long. In the five years since the opening of Colson’s, a nondiscount department store, a new store has opened at the location of every store in the shopping district that closed because it could not compete with Colson’s.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A: A. Many customers of Colson’s are expected to do less shopping there than they did before the SpendLess store opened.
B: B. Increasingly, the stores that have opened in the central shopping district since Colson’s opened have been discount stores.
C: C. At present, the central shopping district has as many stores operating in it as it ever had.
D: D. Over the course of the next five years, it is expected that Goreville’s population will grow at a faster rate than it has for the past several decades.
E: E. Many stores in the central shopping district sell types of merchandise that are not available at either SpendLess or Colson’s. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Due to competition from a recently opened SpendLess discount department store, discount stores in Goreville’s central shopping district are expected to close within five years. But those locations will not be vacant long, for new stores have replaced all those that closed because of the opening five years ago of a Colson’s nondiscount department store.
### Reasoning: 
 Which option would most weaken the argument? The arguer infers that stores that leave because of the SpendLess will be replaced in their locations by other stores because that is what happened after the Colson’s department store came in. Since the reasoning relies on a presumed similarity between the two cases, any information that brings to light a relevant dissimilarity would weaken the argument. If the stores that were driven out by Colson’s were replaced mostly by discount stores, that suggests that the stores were replaced because of a need that no longer exists after the opening of SpendLess.
Explanation A: A. The fact that Colson’s may be seeing fewer customers does not mean that the discount stores that close will not be replaced; they might be replaced by stores that in no way compete with Colson’s or SpendLess.
Explanation B: B. Correct. As explained in the Reasoning section above, the reasoning in the argument relies on a presumed similarity between the two cases, so any information that brings to light a relevant dissimilarity would weaken the argument. In the previous five years, the stores that went out of business were apparently direct competitors of Colson’s, whereas their replacements were of a different type. In contrast, in the predicted scenario, the stores that are expected to go out of business are apparently direct competitors of the new SpendLess discount store. Furthermore, if there has been a significant increase in the number of discount stores in the shopping district, the market for discount stores may well be nearly saturated, so that few, if any, new ones can survive.
Explanation C: C. If anything, this strengthens the argument by indicating that Goreville’s central shopping district is thriving.
Explanation D: D. This strengthens the argument because one is more likely to open a new store in an area with a growing population.
Explanation E: E. Because this statement does not indicate whether any of these stores that offer goods not sold at SpendLess or Colson’s will be among those that are closing, it is not possible to determine what effect it has on the strength of the argument.

This year city services will separate for recycling enough refuse to reduce the number of truckloads of refuse to be incinerated to half of last year’s number.

### Question:
Which of the following is required for the revamped collection program to achieve its aim?
A: A. This year no materials that city services could separate for recycling will be incinerated.
B: B. Separating recyclable materials from materials to be incinerated will cost Shelbyville less than half what it cost last year to dispose of the residual ash.
C: C. Refuse collected by city services will contain a larger proportion of recyclable materials this year than it did last year.
D: D. The refuse incinerated this year will generate no more residual ash per truckload incinerated than did the refuse incinerated last year.
E: E. The total quantity of refuse collected by Shelbyville city services this year will be no greater than that collected last year. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 To cut in half the residual ash produced at its incinerator, the city will separate, for recycling, enough refuse to cut in half the number of truckloads of refuse going to the incinerator.
### Reasoning: 
 Which option is required if the city’s revamped collection program is to achieve its aim? Cutting the number of truckloads of refuse in half must reduce the amount of residual ash to half last year’s level. But if removal of the recycled refuse does not proportionately reduce the amount of ash, this will not happen. So, if the amount of residual ash produced per truckload increases after recycling, then the amount of ash produced will not be cut in half by cutting in half the number of truckloads.
Explanation A: A. This merely indicates that no further reduction of ash through recycling could be achieved this year; it indicates nothing about how much the ash will be reduced.
Explanation B: B. This suggests a further benefit from recycling but does not bear on the amount of ash that will be produced.
Explanation C: C. Since no information is provided about how much, if any, recyclable materials were removed from the refuse last year, this does not affect the reasoning.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This states a requirement for the collection program to achieve its aim. To see why this is required, assume this were not true. Suppose, instead, that the refuse incinerated this year would generate more residual ash per truckload incinerated than the refuse incinerated last year did. If that were the case, then cutting in half the truckloads to be incinerated would not cut in half the amount of residual ash generated by incineration.
Explanation E: E. This is not a requirement because even if the city collects more refuse this year, it could still cut in half the amount of residual ash by cutting in half the number of truckloads going to the incinerator.

### Context:
Veterinarians generally derive some of their income from selling several manufacturers’ lines of pet-care products. Knowing that pet owners rarely throw away mail from their pet’s veterinarian unread, one manufacturer of pet-care products offered free promotional materials on its products to veterinarians for mailing to their clients. Very few veterinarians accepted the offer, however, even though the manufacturer’s products are of high quality. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the veterinarians’ reaction to the

### Question:
manufacturer’s promotional scheme?
A: A. Most of the veterinarians to whom the free promotional materials were offered were already selling the manufacturer’s pet-care products to their clients.
B: B. The special promotional materials were intended as a supplement to the manufacturer’s usual promotional activities rather than as a replacement for them.
C: C. The manufacturer’s products, unlike most equally good competing products sold by veterinarians, are also available in pet stores and in supermarkets.
D: D. Many pet owners have begun demanding quality in products they buy for their pets that is as high as that in products they buy for themselves.
E: E. Veterinarians sometimes recommend that pet owners use products formulated for people when no suitable product specially formulated for animals is available. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Veterinarians generally derive some income from selling various manufacturers’ pet-care products, but very few veterinarians accepted free promotional materials from one such manufacturer to mail to their clients.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most help explain why so few veterinarians accepted the free promotional materials to mail to their clients? The passage says that veterinarians generally derive income from selling pet-care products, which suggests that it should have been in many veterinarians’ financial interest to accept and mail out the free promotional materials to increase sales. Any evidence that mailing out these specific promotional materials from this manufacturer would not actually have been in many veterinarians’ financial interest could help explain why so few veterinarians accepted the materials.
Explanation A: A. This suggests that most of the veterinarians should have had a financial interest in accepting and mailing out the promotional materials in order to increase their sales of the manufacturer’s products.
Explanation B: B. Even if the promotional materials supplemented the manufacturer’s usual promotional activities, they could still have increased the veterinarians’ sales of the manufacturer’s products and thus generated more income for the veterinarians.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If this manufacturer’s products are available in pet stores and supermarkets but most other products sold by veterinarians are not, then distributing the manufacturer’s promotional materials could have encouraged customers to buy this manufacturer’s products from pet stores and supermarkets rather than to buy competing products from the veterinarians. Thus, the veterinarians may have been concerned that the promotions would reduce their profits.
Explanation D: D. The passage says the manufacturer’s products are of high quality, so we have no reason to suppose that clients’ demand for quality products would discourage veterinarians from accepting the manufacturer’s promotional materials.
Explanation E: E. Presumably the manufacturer’s products are specially formulated for pets, so any products veterinarians recommend only when no specially formulated pet-care products are available would not reduce the veterinarians’ interest in promoting the manufacturer’s products.

### Context:
The average hourly wage of television assemblers in Vernland has long been significantly lower than that in neighboring Borodia. Since Borodia dropped all tariffs on Vernlandian televisions three years ago, the number of televisions sold annually in Borodia has not changed. However, recent statistics show a drop in the number of television assemblers in Borodia. Therefore, updated trade statistics will probably indicate that the number of televisions Borodia imports annually from Vernland has increased.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A: A. The number of television assemblers in Vernland has increased by at least as much as the number of television assemblers in Borodia has decreased.
B: B. Televisions assembled in Vernland have features that televisions assembled in Borodia do not have.
C: C. The average number of hours it takes a Borodian television assembler to assemble a television has not decreased significantly during the past three years.
D: D. The number of televisions assembled annually in Vernland has increased significantly during the past three years.
E: E. The difference between the hourly wage of television assemblers in Vernland and the hourly wage of television assemblers in Borodia is likely to decrease in the next few years. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Television assemblers in Vernland are paid less than those in neighboring Borodia. The number of televisions sold in Borodia has not dropped since its tariffs on Vernlandian TVs were lowered three years ago, but the number of TV assemblers in Borodia has. So, TV imports from Vernland have likely increased.
### Reasoning: 
 What assumption does the argument depend on? The fact that fewer individuals in Borodia are working as TV assemblers is offered as evidence that TV imports from Vernland into Borodia have likely increased. That piece of evidence is relevant only as an indication that the number of TVs being produced within Borodia has decreased. But a drop in the number of TV assemblers does not indicate a drop in the number of TVs being assembled if the number of TVs an average assembler puts together has increased. Thus, the argument must be assuming that the average time it takes an assembler to put together a TV has not significantly decreased.
Explanation A: A. The argument does not rely on any information about the number of television assemblers in Vernland nor, for that matter, on the number of TVs assembled in Vernland.
Explanation B: B. The argument need not assume there is any difference in the features of the TVs produced in the two countries. Increased sales of Vernlandian TVs in Borodia could be due to any number of other reasons, such as price or quality.
Explanation C: C. Correct. If the average productivity of TV assemblers had increased significantly, the fact that there are fewer Borodian TV assemblers would not strongly support the conclusion that there has been a decrease in the number of TVs assembled in Borodia and an increase in imports; fewer assemblers may be producing just as many TVs as before. Therefore, for the argument to work, it needs to assume that productivity per assembler in Borodia has not decreased significantly.
Explanation D: D. The argument does not depend upon this being so: Vernland’s domestic TV sales (or perhaps its exports to countries other than Borodia) may have decreased by more than its exports to Borodia have increased.
Explanation E: E. The argument’s conclusion addresses what has happened; the argument in no way relies on any assumptions about what may or may not happen in the coming years.

### Context:
Guidebook writer: I have visited hotels throughout the country and have noticed that in those built before 1930 the quality of the original carpentry work is generally superior to that in hotels built afterward. Clearly, carpenters working on hotels before 1930 typically worked with more skill, care, and effort than carpenters who have worked on hotels built subsequently.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the guidebook writer’s argument?
A: A. The quality of original carpentry in hotels is generally far superior to the quality of original carpentry in other structures, such as houses and stores.
B: B. Hotels built since 1930 can generally accommodate more guests than those built before 1930.
C: C. The materials available to carpenters working before 1930 were not significantly different in quality from the materials available to carpenters working after 1930.
D: D. The better the quality of original carpentry in a building, the less likely that building is to fall into disuse and be demolished.
E: E. The average length of apprenticeship for carpenters has declined significantly since 1930. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The original carpentry in hotels built before 1930 shows superior care, skill, and effort to that in hotels built after 1930. This leads to the conclusion that carpenters working on hotels before 1930 were superior in skill, care, and effort to those who came after.
### Reasoning: 
 Which option most seriously weakens the argument? The argument draws an inference from a comparison between carpentry in hotels of different eras to a judgment about the carpenters working on hotels in those eras. One way to weaken this inference is by finding some way in which the carpentry in the hotels may be unrepresentative of the skill, care, and effort of the carpenters working in the eras. The comparison is between the carpentry evident in hotels of the two eras that still exist. Thus, if there is some reason to think that hotels with good carpentry survive longer than those with bad carpentry, then still-existing hotels from the older era will have disproportionately more good carpentry, even assuming no difference between the skill, care, and effort of the carpenters from the two eras.
Explanation A: A. This option applies equally to both eras, so it has no bearing on the argument.
Explanation B: B. It is not clear whether carpenters working on larger hotels would exercise more, less, or the same skill and care as those working on smaller hotels; thus, this option does not weaken the argument.
Explanation C: C. The argument does not rely, even implicitly, on there being any difference in the quality of materials used in the two eras, so it does not weaken the argument to point out that no such difference exists.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This weakens the reasoning in the argument by showing a respect in which the comparison between existing hotels may be unrepresentative. Specifically, the comparison may be unrepresentative in that still-existing hotels that were built prior to 1930 may well have been better built than most hotels built prior to 1930 were; the hotels that did not have unusually high-quality carpentry work may have all fallen into disuse and been demolished.
Explanation E: E. The longer a carpenter works as an apprentice, the more skill he or she is apt to have upon becoming a full-fledged carpenter. So, this option would tend to slightly strengthen rather than weaken the argument.

### Context:
Scientists typically do their most creative work before the age of forty  It is commonly thought that this happens because aging by itself brings about a loss of creative capacity. However, studies show that of scientists who produce highly creative work beyond the age of forty, a disproportionately large number entered their field at an older age than is usual. Since by the age of forty the large majority of scientists have been working in their field for at least fifteen years, the studies’ finding strongly suggests that the real reason why scientists over forty rarely produce highly creative work is not that they have aged but rather that scientists over forty have generally spent too long in their field.

### Question:
In the argument given, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first is a claim, the accuracy of which is at issue in the argument; the second is a conclusion drawn on the basis of that claim.
B: B. The first is an objection that has been raised against a position defended in the argument; the second is that position.
C: C. The first is evidence that has been used to support an explanation that the argument challenges; the second is that explanation.
D: D. The first is evidence that has been used to support an explanation that the argument challenges; the second is a competing explanation that the argument favors.
E: E. The first provides evidence to support an explanation that the argument favors; the second is that explanation. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 It is generally thought that the reason scientists tend to do their most creative work before age forty is that creative capacity declines with age. Yet those scientists who do creative work after forty tend, disproportionately, to have started their careers in science later in life. So, a better explanation is that many scientists over forty have just been at it too long.
### Reasoning: 
 What roles do the two portions of the argument that are in boldface play? The argument describes a phenomenon and what is commonly thought to explain it. Then the first boldfaced statement introduces evidence that suggests that there may be another explanation. After this evidence is further developed, the argument then concludes that there is indeed a better explanation for the phenomenon; that explanation is stated in the second boldfaced portion.
Explanation A: A. The accuracy of the first statement is never called into question by the argument; rather, it is relied upon as the basis for the argument’s conclusion.
Explanation B: B. The first statement is not an objection against the position the argument defends; instead, it is a basis for that position.
Explanation C: C. The first statement is not used to support a position the argument challenges, and the second statement is the explanation the argument supports, not the one it challenges.
Explanation D: D. The second statement is indeed an explanation that the argument favors, but the first statement is not used to support a competing explanation that the argument challenges.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This option correctly identifies the roles played by the boldfaced portions of the argument.

### Context:
NorthAir charges low fares for its economy-class seats, but it provides very cramped seating and few amenities. Market research shows that economy passengers would willingly pay more for wider seating and better service, and additional revenue provided by these higher ticket prices would more than cover the additional cost of providing these amenities. Even though NorthAir is searching for ways to improve its profitability, it has decided not to make these improvements. Which of the following, if true, would most help to explain NorthAir’s decision in light of its

objectives?
A: A. None of NorthAir’s competitors offers significantly better seating and service to economy-class passengers than NorthAir does.
B: B. On many of the routes that NorthAir flies, it is the only airline to offer direct flights.
C: C. A few of NorthAir’s economy-class passengers are satisfied with the service they receive, given the low price they pay.
D: D. Very few people avoid flying on NorthAir because of the cramped seating and poor service offered in economy class.
E: E. The number of people who would be willing to pay the high fares NorthAir charges for its business-class seats would decrease if its economy-class seating were more acceptable. Evaluation of a Plan

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Market research shows that improving some amenities for economy-class passengers would allow NorthAir to raise its economy ticket prices more than enough to cover the additional cost of providing those amenities. But NorthAir has decided not to improve those amenities, even though it is looking for ways to improve its profitability.
### Reasoning: 
 What would most help explain why NorthAir decided not to improve the seating and other amenities, even though the resulting increase in economy-class ticket prices would more than cover the expense? NorthAir is looking for ways to improve its profitability. Making improvements that would increase ticket prices enough to generate more revenue than they cost should improve profitability, other things being equal. But if improving the amenities would generate side effects that reduced profitability, those side effects would provide a good reason for NorthAir’s decision not to improve the amenities and hence would help explain why NorthAir made that decision.
Explanation A: A. The passage says that for NorthAir, the cost of providing better economy seating and other amenities would be more than met by the increased revenue from the higher ticket prices that passengers would be willing to pay. This could give NorthAir a competitive edge, with improved profitability.
Explanation B: B. Even if NorthAir faces little or no competition on certain routes, offering extra amenities might increase passengers’ interest in flying those routes. It might also lead passengers to choose NorthAir on other routes that competing airlines also serve. Both of these effects could improve NorthAir’s profitability.
Explanation C: C. Even if a few NorthAir economy passengers would not pay more for extra amenities, the market research indicates that most of them would, so offering the amenities could still improve NorthAir’s profits attributable to economy-class seating.
Explanation D: D. This suggests that improving the amenities would not increase the total number of NorthAir passengers. But improving the amenities might still enable the airline to increase its ticket prices per passenger enough to improve its profitability.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This suggests that improving the economy-class amenities would reduce NorthAir’s revenue from sales of business-class tickets, which are likely much more expensive than economy-class tickets. This reduction in revenue could be enough to reduce NorthAir’s total profitability despite the increased revenue from economy-class ticket sales.

### Context:
Which of the following most logically completes the argument given? Asthma, a chronic breathing disorder, is significantly more common today among adult competitive swimmers than it is among competitive athletes who specialize in other sports. Although chlorine is now known to be a lung irritant and swimming pool water is generally chlorinated, it would be rash to assume that frequent exposure to chlorine is the explanation

of the high incidence of asthma among these swimmers, since __________.
A: A. young people who have asthma are no more likely to become competitive athletes than are young people who do not have asthma
B: B. competitive athletes who specialize in sports other than swimming are rarely exposed to chlorine
C: C. competitive athletes as a group have a significantly lower incidence of asthma than do people who do not participate in competitive athletics
D: D. until a few years ago, physicians routinely recommended competitive swimming to children with asthma, in the belief that this form of exercise could alleviate asthma symptoms
E: E. many people have asthma without knowing they have it and thus are not diagnosed with the condition until they begin engaging in very strenuous activities, such as competitive athletics Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Asthma is more common among competitive swimmers than among other competitive athletes. Chlorine is a lung irritant generally present in swimming pool water.
### Reasoning: 
 What would cast doubt on the hypothesis that exposure to chlorine in swimming pools accounts for the high incidence of asthma among adult competitive swimmers? Evidence of any other factor that would provide an alternative explanation of why asthma is more common among adult competitive swimmers than among other competitive athletes would make it rash to assume that frequent exposure to chlorine explains the high incidence of asthma among these swimmers, so a statement providing such evidence would logically fill in the blank at the end of the passage to complete the argument.
Explanation A: A. This might help explain why competitive athletes in general are not especially likely to have asthma, but it does not explain why adult competitive swimmers are more likely to have asthma than other competitive athletes are.
Explanation B: B. This provides additional evidence that exposure to chlorine explains why adult competitive swimmers are more likely to have asthma than other competitive athletes are, so it does not cast doubt on that hypothesis.
Explanation C: C. A lower incidence of asthma among competitive athletes than among nonathletes does not help explain the higher incidence of asthma among adult competitive swimmers than among other competitive athletes.
Explanation D: D. Correct. Routinely encouraging children with asthma to take up competitive swimming would likely have made the proportion of adult competitive swimmers with asthma exceed the proportion of other competitive athletes with asthma, even if chlorine in swimming pool water never causes asthma in swimmers.
Explanation E: E. This might help explain why people with asthma are just as likely as other people to become competitive athletes, but it does not help explain why adult competitive swimmers are more likely to have asthma than other competitive athletes are.

### Context:
In the country of Marut, the Foreign Trade Agency’s records were reviewed in 1994 in light of information then newly available about neighboring Goro. The review revealed that in every year since 1963, the agency’s projection of what Goro’s gross national product (GNP) would be five years later was a serious underestimate. The review also revealed that in every year since 1963, the agency estimated Goro’s GNP for the previous year—a Goro state secret— very accurately.

### Question:
Of the following claims, which is most strongly supported by the statements given?
A: A. Goro’s GNP fluctuated greatly between 1963 and 1994.
B: B. Prior to 1995, Goro had not released data intended to mislead the agency in making its five-year projections.
C: C. The amount by which the agency underestimated the GNP it projected for Goro tended to increase over time.
D: D. Even before the new information came to light, the agency had reason to think that at least some of the five-year projections it had made were inaccurate.
E: E. The agency’s five-year projections of Goro’s GNP had no impact on economic planning in Marut. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A review in 1994 revealed that every year since 1963, Marut’s Foreign Trade Agency had seriously underestimated what Goro’s GNP would be five years later but accurately estimated what Goro’s GNP had been the previous year.
### Reasoning: 
 What conclusion do the stated facts most strongly support? Goro’s GNP in each year at least from 1969 through 1993 had been seriously underestimated by the agency five years in advance, yet was then accurately estimated by the agency one year after the fact. It follows that for each of these years, the agency’s earlier projection of Goro’s GNP must have been much lower than its later estimate.
Explanation A: A. This is not supported by the information given. The fact that the agency consistently underestimated each year’s GNP in its five-year projections and then correctly estimated it after the fact does not indicate that Goro’s GNP fluctuated greatly.
Explanation B: B. This is not supported by the information given. The reason the agency’s five-year projections were inaccurate might well have been that Goro deliberately released data intended to mislead the agency in making those projections.
Explanation C: C. This is not supported by the information given. The fact that the underestimates remained large throughout the years in question does not indicate that the underestimates increased over time.
Explanation D: D. Correct. As explained above, for many years there were serious discrepancies between the agency’s five-year projections of Goro’s GNP and its retrospective estimates of each previous year’s trade. In any year at least from 1970 through 1993, these discrepancies, if noticed, would have given the agency reason to doubt some of the five-year projections.
Explanation E: E. This is not supported by the information given. Even though at least some of the five-year projections were eventually known to be serious underestimates, they could still have affected Marut’s economic planning. The economic planners might have retained an unreasonable faith in the accuracy of the most recent projections.

### Context:
Vargonia has just introduced a legal requirement that student-teacher ratios in government- funded schools not exceed a certain limit. All Vargonian children are entitled to education, free of charge, in these schools. When a recession occurs and average incomes fall, the number of children enrolled in government-funded schools tends to increase. Therefore, though most employment opportunities contract in economic recessions, getting a teaching job in Vargonia’s government-funded schools will not be made more difficult by a recession. Which of the following would be most important to determine in order to evaluate the

### Question:
argument?
A: A. Whether in Vargonia there are any schools not funded by the government that offer children an education free of charge
B: B. Whether the number of qualified applicants for teaching positions in government-funded schools increases significantly during economic recessions
C: C. What the current student-teacher ratio in Vargonia’s government-funded schools is
D: D. What proportion of Vargonia’s workers currently hold jobs as teachers in government- funded schools
E: E. Whether in the past a number of government-funded schools in Vargonia have had student-teacher ratios well in excess of the new limit Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 During a recession, the number of children in government-funded schools in Vargonia tends to increase. Vargonian children are entitled to a free education in these schools. A new law requires student-teacher ratios in these schools to remain below a certain limit.
### Reasoning: 
 Which of the five questions would provide us with the best information for evaluating the argument? The argument’s conclusion is that recessions do not make teaching jobs in Vargonia’s government-funded schools harder to get. During recessions, the reasoning goes, more students will enroll in Vargonia’s government-funded schools than in nonrecession times. Implicit in the argument is the thought that, because the new law sets an upper limit on the average number of students per teacher, schools that get an influx of new students would have to hire more teachers. During a recession, however, there might be much more competition in the labor market for teachers because many more qualified people are applying for teaching jobs.
Explanation A: A. This information is not significant in the context of the argument, which does not need to assume that only government-funded schools provide free education.
Explanation B: B. Correct. Getting an answer to this question would provide us with specific information useful in evaluating the argument. A “yes” answer to this question would suggest that competition for teaching jobs in Vargonian government-funded schools would be keener during recessions. A “no” answer would suggest that the level of competition would decrease during recessions.
Explanation C: C. Discovering the current student-teacher ratio in Vargonia’s schools would be of no value, by itself, in evaluating the argument. We do not know what the new upper limit on the student-teacher ratio is, and we do not know whether Vargonia is currently in a recession.
Explanation D: D. Finding out whether the proportion this refers to is 1 percent, for example, or 4 percent, would tell us nothing about whether getting teaching jobs at government-funded schools in Vargonia becomes more difficult during a recession. Among other things, we do not know whether Vargonia is currently in a recession, and we do not know what proportion of Vargonia’s workers would be qualified candidates for teaching jobs.
Explanation E: E. This is of no relevance in evaluating the argument because, presumably, the new limit on student-teacher ratios will be complied with. Thus, even if student-teacher ratios in the past would have exceeded the new limit, the argument concerns whether, in the future, getting a teaching job in Vargonia’s government-funded schools will be made more difficult by a recession.

### Context:
In Colorado subalpine meadows, nonnative dandelions co-occur with a native flower, the larkspur. Bumblebees visit both species, creating the potential for interactions between the two species with respect to pollination. In a recent study, researchers selected 16 plots containing both species; all dandelions were removed from eight plots; the remaining eight control plots were left undisturbed. The control plots yielded significantly more larkspur seeds than the dandelion-free plots, leading the researchers to conclude that the presence of dandelions facilitates pollination (and hence seed production) in the native species by attracting more pollinators to the mixed plots.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the researchers’ reasoning?
A: A. Bumblebees preferentially visit dandelions over larkspurs in mixed plots.
B: B. In mixed plots, pollinators can transfer pollen from one species to another to augment seed production.
C: C. If left unchecked, nonnative species like dandelions quickly crowd out native species.
D: D. Seed germination is a more reliable measure of a species’ fitness than seed production.
E: E. Soil disturbances can result in fewer blooms, and hence lower seed production. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Bumblebees visit both larkspur and dandelions in certain meadows. A study found that more larkspur seeds were produced in meadow plots in which both larkspur and dandelions grew than in similar plots from which all dandelions had been removed. The researchers inferred that dandelions facilitate larkspur pollination.
### Reasoning: 
 What evidence would cast the most doubt on the inference from the study’s findings to the conclusion that dandelions facilitate larkspur pollination by attracting more pollinators? The argument assumes that the only relevant difference between the two types of plots was whether dandelions were present. Evidence that the plots differed in some other way that could provide a plausible alternative explanation of why more larkspur seeds were produced in the plots with dandelions would weaken the argument.
Explanation A: A. This would suggest that the larkspur pollination should have been lower in the plots with dandelions, so it does not provide a plausible alternative explanation for the study’s findings.
Explanation B: B. This is fully compatible with the claim that the dandelions attracted more pollinators to the mixed plots, and it would also help to support the argument’s conclusion that dandelions facilitated larkspur pollination in those plots.
Explanation C: C. Although this suggests that the mixed plots won’t remain mixed for long, it does not provide a plausible alternative explanation for the study’s finding that larkspur seed production was higher in the mixed plots.
Explanation D: D. The argument is not about how fit larkspurs are as a species but about why they produced different numbers of seeds in the different plots.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This provides a plausible alternative explanation for why larkspur seed production was lower in the plots from which dandelions had been removed, since digging them out would have disturbed the soil.

### Context:
An experiment was done in which human subjects recognize a pattern within a matrix of abstract designs and then select another design that completes that pattern. The results of the experiment were surprising. The lowest expenditure of energy in neurons in the brain was found in those subjects who performed most successfully in the experiments.

### Question:
Which of the following hypotheses best accounts for the findings of the experiment?
A: A. The neurons of the brain react less when a subject is trying to recognize patterns than when the subject is doing other kinds of reasoning.
B: B. Those who performed best in the experiment experienced more satisfaction when working with abstract patterns than did those who performed less well.
C: C. People who are better at abstract pattern recognition have more energy-efficient neural connections.
D: D. The energy expenditure of the subjects’ brains increases when a design that completes the initially recognized pattern is determined.
E: E. The task of completing a given design is more capably performed by athletes, whose energy expenditure is lower when they are at rest. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Experimental subjects worked with pattern recognition and completion. The subjects who performed best showed the lowest expenditure of energy in neurons in the brain.
### Reasoning: 
 Which hypothesis best accounts for the findings? In order to account for the findings, the hypothesis must suggest a plausible link between successful performance and the energy expenditure of neurons in the brain. Consider each answer choice, and evaluate its plausibility and logic. Where is there a reasonably direct relationship between the given factors and the conclusion that is drawn? Understand that hypotheses based on factors not included in the experiment cannot be used to account for the findings.
Explanation A: A. The experiment did not compare types of reasoning, so this hypothesis does not account for the results.
Explanation B: B. No information is provided about subjects’ satisfaction, so this hypothesis is not warranted.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This statement properly identifies a hypothesis that connects subjects’ performance with their energy expenditure and so could account for the experiment’s results.
Explanation D: D. The most successful subjects would presumably not have completed fewer patterns than average, so the posited increase in energy would likely lead to higher energy expenditures for them, not lower.
Explanation E: E. No information is offered on the subjects, so no hypothesis about athletes is warranted.

### Context:
With seventeen casinos, Moneyland operates the most casinos in a certain state  Although intent on expanding, it was outmaneuvered by Apex Casinos in negotiations to acquire the Eldorado chain. To complete its acquisition of Eldorado, Apex must sell five casinos to comply with a state law forbidding any owner to operate more than one casino per county. Since Apex will still be left operating twenty casinos in the state, it will then have the most casinos in the state.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the prediction?
A: A. Apex, Eldorado, and Moneyland are the only organizations licensed to operate casinos in the state.
B: B. The majority of Eldorado’s casinos in the state will need extensive renovations if they are to continue to operate profitably.
C: C. Some of the state’s counties do not permit casinos.
D: D. Moneyland already operates casinos in the majority of the state’s counties.
E: E. Apex will use funds it obtains from the sale of the five casinos to help fund its acquisition of the Eldorado chain. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Moneyland operates seventeen casinos, the most in a certain state, and is intent on expanding. Another operator, Apex Casinos, is acquiring the Eldorado casino chain but must sell five casinos to comply with a state law forbidding any owner to operate more than one casino per county. After these transactions, Apex will operate twenty casinos in the state.
### Reasoning: 
 What observation would cast the most doubt on the prediction that Apex will have the most casinos in the state after the transactions? Apex will operate twenty casinos, whereas Moneyland now operates just seventeen, and no one else operates even that many. It follows that Apex will operate more casinos after its transactions than Moneyland or any other one owner now operates. However, if Moneyland also acquires three or more casinos during the transactions, then Apex will not have the most casinos in the state afterward. Thus, any observation suggesting that Moneyland is about to acquire several casinos would undermine the prediction.
Explanation A: A. Correct. Since Apex is acquiring Eldorado, Moneyland and Apex will be the only remaining licensed casino operators in the state. Therefore, Moneyland is the only likely buyer for the five casinos Apex needs to sell. So, Moneyland is likely to acquire the five casinos during the sale and end up with twenty-two casinos—more than Apex.
Explanation B: B. This does not undermine the prediction. Even if the Eldorado casinos cannot operate profitably for long without extensive renovations, Apex will still have twenty casinos immediately after its transactions.
Explanation C: C. This supports rather than undermines the prediction. If fewer counties permit casinos, there will be fewer opportunities for Moneyland or any other operator to acquire more casinos to surpass the twenty Apex will own.
Explanation D: D. This supports rather than undermines the prediction. If Moneyland’s seventeen casinos are in most of the state’s counties already, then there are fewer counties in which Moneyland could acquire additional casinos to surpass the twenty Apex will own.
Explanation E: E. This supports rather than undermines the prediction. Apex’s use of the funds from selling the five casinos to acquire the Eldorado chain will not help anyone else to acquire more casinos to surpass the twenty Apex will own.

### Context:
It is widely assumed that people need to engage in intellectual activities such as solving crossword puzzles or mathematics problems in order to maintain mental sharpness as they age. In fact, however, simply talking to other people—that is, participating in social interaction, which engages many mental and perceptual skills—suffices. Evidence to this effect comes from a study showing that the more social contact people report, the better their mental skills.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the force of the evidence cited?
A: A. As people grow older, they are often advised to keep exercising their physical and mental capacities in order to maintain or improve them.
B: B. Many medical conditions and treatments that adversely affect a person’s mental sharpness also tend to increase that person’s social isolation.
C: C. Many people are proficient both in social interactions and in solving mathematical problems.
D: D. The study did not itself collect data but analyzed data bearing on the issue from prior studies.
E: E. The tasks evaluating mental sharpness for which data were compiled by the study were more akin to mathematics problems than to conversation. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 A study shows that the more social contact people report, the better their mental skills are, so engaging in social interaction is sufficient for maintaining mental sharpness.
### Reasoning: 
 What would suggest that the study does not establish the truth of the conclusion? The study shows a correlation between mental sharpness and social interaction but does not indicate why this correlation exists. Evidence that mental sharpness contributes to social interaction, or that some third factor affects both mental sharpness and social interaction, could provide an alternative explanation for the correlation and thus cast doubt on the explanation that social interaction contributes to mental sharpness.
Explanation A: A. People are often wrongly advised to do things that are not actually beneficial. And even if exercising mental capacities does help to maintain them, the passage says that social interaction provides such exercise.
Explanation B: B. Correct. This provides evidence that the correlation observed in the study results from mental sharpness facilitating social interaction, in which case the study results do not indicate that social interaction facilitates mental sharpness.
Explanation C: C. This would be expected, given the argument’s conclusion that social interaction helps to maintain better mental skills overall.
Explanation D: D. A study that analyzes data from prior studies can provide evidence just as well as a study that collects its own data can.
Explanation E: E. The argument’s conclusion would be compatible with this observation and would then suggest that social interaction contributes to the mental sharpness needed for tasks similar to math problems.

### Context:
In the United States, of the people who moved from one state to another when they retired, the percentage who retired to Florida has decreased by three percentage points over the past ten years. Since many local businesses in Florida cater to retirees, these declines are likely to have a noticeably negative economic effect on these businesses and therefore on the economy of Florida.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument given?
A: A. People who moved from one state to another when they retired moved a greater distance, on average, last year than such people did ten years ago.
B: B. People were more likely to retire to North Carolina from another state last year than people were ten years ago.
C: C. The number of people who moved from one state to another when they retired has increased significantly over the past ten years.
D: D. The number of people who left Florida when they retired to live in another state was greater last year than it was ten years ago.
E: E. Florida attracts more people who move from one state to another when they retire than does any other state. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Of those people who move to another state when they retire, the percentage moving to Florida has declined. This trend is apt to harm Florida’s economy because many businesses there cater to retirees.
### Reasoning: 
 Which of the options most weakens the argument? The argument draws its conclusion from data about the proportion of emigrating retirees moving to Florida. Yet what matters more directly to the conclusion (and to Florida’s economy) is the absolute number of retirees immigrating to Florida. That number could have remained constant, or even risen, if the absolute number of emigrating retirees itself increased while the proportion going to Florida decreased.
Explanation A: A. This has no obvious bearing on the argument one way or another. It makes it more likely, perhaps, that a person in a distant state will retire to Florida but less likely that one in a neighboring state will do so.
Explanation B: B. This has no bearing on whether fewer people have been retiring to Florida over the last ten years.
Explanation C: C. Correct. This is the option that most seriously weakens the argument.
Explanation D: D. This makes it more likely that Florida’s economy will be harmed because of decreasing numbers of retirees, but it has no real bearing on the argument which concludes specifically that declines in the proportion of emigrating retirees moving to Florida will have a negative effect on the state’s economy.
Explanation E: E. This is irrelevant. At issue is how the numbers of retirees in Florida from one year compare to the next, not how those numbers compare with numbers of retirees in other states.

### Context:
The spacing of the four holes on a fragment of a bone flute excavated at a Neanderthal campsite is just what is required to play the third through sixth notes of the diatonic scale— the seven-note musical scale used in much of Western music since the Renaissance. Musicologists therefore hypothesize that the diatonic musical scale was developed and used thousands of years before it was adopted by Western musicians.

### Question:
Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the hypothesis?
A: A. Bone flutes were probably the only musical instrument made by Neanderthals.
B: B. No musical instrument that is known to have used a diatonic scale is of an earlier date than the flute found at the Neanderthal campsite.
C: C. The flute was made from a cave-bear bone, and the campsite at which the flute fragment was excavated was in a cave that also contained skeletal remains of cave bears.
D: D. Flutes are the simplest wind instrument that can be constructed to allow playing a diatonic scale.
E: E. The cave-bear leg bone used to make the Neanderthal flute would have been long enough to make a flute capable of playing a complete diatonic scale. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The arrangement of the holes in a bone fragment from a Neanderthal campsite matches part of the scale used in Western music since the Renaissance. Musicologists hypothesize from this that the scale was developed thousands of years before Western musicians adopted it.
### Reasoning: 
 Which of the options, if true, would provide the most support for the musicologists’ hypothesis? One way to approach this question is to ask yourself, “If this option were false, would the hypothesis be less likely to be true?” If the Neanderthal bone fragment could not have been part of a flute that encompassed the entire seven-note diatonic scale, then the bone fragment’s existence would not provide strong support for the hypothesis.
Explanation A: A. To the extent that this is even relevant, it tends to weaken the hypothesis; it makes less likely the possibility that Neanderthals used other types of musical instruments employing the diatonic scale.
Explanation B: B. This also weakens the hypothesis because it states that there is no known evidence of a certain type that would support the hypothesis.
Explanation C: C. The fact that the cave-bear bone fragment that was apparently a flute came from a site where many other cave-bear skeletal remains were found has little bearing on the hypothesis and in no way supports it.
Explanation D: D. This does not strengthen the hypothesis, for even if the option were false—even if a simpler instrument could be constructed that employed the diatonic scale—the existence of a flute employing the diatonic scale would provide no less support for the hypothesis.
Explanation E: E. Correct. This option most strongly supports the hypothesis.

### Context:
Which of the following most logically completes the passage? The figures in portraits by the Spanish painter El Greco (1541–1614) are systematically elongated. In El Greco’s time, the intentional distortion of human figures was unprecedented in European painting. Consequently, some critics have suggested that El Greco had an astigmatism, a type of visual impairment, that resulted in people appearing to him in the distorted way that is characteristic of his paintings. However, this suggestion cannot be the

### Question:
explanation, because __________.
A: A. several twentieth-century artists have consciously adopted from El Greco’s paintings the systematic elongation of the human form
B: B. some people do have elongated bodies somewhat like those depicted in El Greco’s portraits
C: C. if El Greco had an astigmatism, then, relative to how people looked to him, the elongated figures in his paintings would have appeared to him to be distorted
D: D. even if El Greco had an astigmatism, there would have been no correction for it available in the period in which he lived
E: E. there were non-European artists, even in El Greco’s time, who included in their works human figures that were intentionally distorted Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Figures in portraits by the Spanish painter El Greco are elongated. Some critics infer that this was because El Greco suffered from an astigmatism that made people appear elongated to him. But this explanation cannot be correct.
### Reasoning: 
 Which option would most logically complete the argument? We need something that provides the best reason for thinking that the explanation suggested by critics—astigmatism—cannot be right. The critics’ explanation might seem to work because ordinarily an artist would try to paint an image of a person so that the image would have the same proportions as the perceived person. So, if people seemed to El Greco to have longer arms and legs than they actually had, the arms and legs of the painted figures should appear to others to be longer than people’s arms and legs normally are. This is how the explanation seems to make sense. But if astigmatism were the explanation, then the elongated images in his pictures should have appeared to El Greco to be too long: he would have perceived the images as longer than they actually are— and therefore as inaccurate representations of what he perceived. So, astigmatism cannot be a sufficient explanation for the elongated figures in his paintings.
Explanation A: A. Even if subsequent artists intentionally depicted human forms as more elongated than human figures actually are, and they did so to mimic El Greco’s painted figures, that does not mean that El Greco’s figures were intentionally elongated.
Explanation B: B. Although this option provides another possible explanation for El Greco’s elongated figures, it provides no evidence that the people El Greco painted had such elongated figures.
Explanation C: C. Correct. El Greco would have perceived the images of people in his paintings as too long, relative to his perception of the people themselves. This means that even if El Greco did have astigmatism, that factor would not provide an answer to the question, “Why did El Greco paint images that he knew were distorted?”
Explanation D: D. The absence of an ability to correct astigmatism in El Greco’s day does not undermine the hypothesis that it was astigmatism that caused El Greco to paint elongated figures.
Explanation E: E. Again, this suggests another possible explanation for the distortion—namely, that El Greco did it deliberately—but it does not provide any reason to think that this is the correct explanation (and that the critics’ explanation is actually incorrect).

### Context:
Museums that house Renaissance oil paintings typically store them in environments that are carefully kept within narrow margins of temperature and humidity to inhibit any deterioration. Laboratory tests have shown that the kind of oil paint used in these paintings actually adjusts to climatic changes quite well. If, as some museum directors believe, paint is the most sensitive substance in these works, then by relaxing the standards for temperature and humidity control, museums can reduce energy costs without risking damage to these paintings. Museums would be rash to relax those standards, however, since results of preliminary tests indicate that gesso, a compound routinely used by Renaissance artists to help paint adhere to the canvas, is unable to withstand significant variations in humidity.

### Question:
In the argument above, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first is an objection that has been raised against the position taken by the argument; the second is the position taken by the argument.
B: B. The first is the position taken by the argument; the second is the position that the argument calls into question.

D: D. The first is a judgment that has been offered in support of the position that the argument calls into question; the second is that position.
E: E. The first is a claim that the argument calls into question; the second is the position taken by the argument. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Museums house Renaissance paintings under strictly controlled climatic conditions to prevent deterioration. This is costly. But the paint in these works actually adjusts well to climate changes. On the other hand, another compound routinely used in these paintings, gesso, does not react well to changes in humidity.
### Reasoning: 
 What roles do the two boldfaced statements play in the argument? The first statement is not asserted by the author of the argument, but rather attributed as a belief to some museum directors. What the argument itself asserts is that IF this belief is true, THEN the second boldfaced statement is true. But the argument then goes on to offer evidence that the first statement is false and so concludes that museum directors would be ill-advised to assume that the second statement was true.
Explanation A: A. This option mistakenly claims that the argument adopts the second statement as its position, when in fact the argument calls this position into question.
Explanation B: B. Rather than adopting the first statement, the argument offers evidence that calls it into question.
Explanation C: C. This option contends that the first statement is a judgment that is based on the second; in fact, the opposite is true.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This option properly identifies the roles the two portions in boldface play in the argument.
Explanation E: E. While the argument does call the first statement into question, it also calls the second statement into question as well.

### Context:
Codex Berinensis, a Florentine copy of an ancient Roman medical treatise, is undated but contains clues to when it was produced. Its first 80 pages are by a single copyist, but the remaining 20 pages are by three different copyists, which indicates some significant disruption.

### Question:
was produced in 1148?
A: A. Other than Codex Berinensis, there are no known samples of the handwriting of the first three copyists.
B: B. According to the account by the fourth copyist, the plague went on for 10 months.
C: C. A scribe would be able to copy a page of text the size and style of Codex Berinensis in a day.
D: D. There was only one outbreak of plague in Florence in the 1100s.
E: E. The number of pages of Codex Berinensis produced by a single scribe becomes smaller with each successive change of copyist. Argument Evaluation

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 The Florentine copy of an ancient Roman work is undated but provides clues as to the time it was produced. The first 80 pages of Codex Berinensis are the work of one copyist. The fact that the last 20 pages are the work of a succession of three different copyists is an indication of serious turmoil at the time the copying was done. Since a letter in the fourth copyist’s handwriting reveals that a plague killed many people there in 1148, Codex Berinensis was probably produced in that year.
### Reasoning: 
 Which information supports the hypothesis dating the Codex to 1148? Consider the basis of the hypothesis: the succession of copyists indicating the work was significantly disrupted, and the fourth copyist’s letter indicating the plague of 1148 caused serious loss of life. From this, it is argued that the plague of 1148 was the reason for the multiple copyists and that the work can thus be dated to that year. What if there were multiple plagues? In that case, Codex Berinensis could have been produced at another time. If, instead, only one plague occurred in the 1100s, the elimination of that possibility supports the hypothesis that the work was done in 1148.
Explanation A: A. Examples of the copyists’ handwriting might help date Codex Berinensis; the absence of handwriting samples does not help support 1148 as the date.
Explanation B: B. The length of the plague, while it may account for the succession of copyists, does not help support the particular year the work was done.
Explanation C: C. The amount of work a copyist could achieve each day does not provide any information about the year the work appeared.
Explanation D: D. Correct. This statement properly identifies a circumstance that supports the hypothesis.
Explanation E: E. The productivity or tenure of the various copyists is irrelevant to establishing the date.

### Context:
Excavations of the Roman city of Sepphoris have uncovered numerous detailed mosaics depicting several readily identifiable animal species: a hare, a partridge, and various Mediterranean fish. Oddly, most of the species represented did not live in the Sepphoris region when these mosaics were created. Since identical motifs appear in mosaics found in other Roman cities, however, the mosaics of Sepphoris were very likely created by traveling artisans from some other part of the Roman Empire.

### Question:
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A: A. The Sepphoris mosaics are not composed exclusively of types of stones found naturally in the Sepphoris area.
B: B. There is no single region to which all the species depicted in the Sepphoris mosaics are native.
C: C. No motifs appear in the Sepphoris mosaics that do not also appear in the mosaics of some other Roman city.
D: D. All of the animal figures in the Sepphoris mosaics are readily identifiable as representations of known species.
E: E. There was not a common repertory of mosaic designs with which artisans who lived in various parts of the Roman Empire were familiar. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 Mosaics uncovered at the site of the Roman city of Sepphoris depict animals that did not live in Sepphoris. Because identical motifs appear in other Roman cities, traveling artisans from elsewhere in the Roman Empire likely created the mosaics of Sepphoris.
### Reasoning: 
 What assumption underlies this argument? The argument implicitly assumes that the artisans who created the mosaics had seen the animals depicted firsthand. This suggests that the artisans had been to the regions where these animals live and then traveled to Sepphoris to create the mosaics depicting non-native animals. This, in turn, suggests the assumption that the artisans were not including these motifs based solely on familiarity with motifs common throughout the Empire.
Explanation A: A. The argument draws its conclusion based on subjects of the mosaics, not on the types of stones used in the mosaics, so the origin of the stone is irrelevant.
Explanation B: B. The argument does not rely on the assumption that the species depicted in the Sepphoris mosaics are native to disparate regions, only on the idea that traveling artisans must have seen such species.
Explanation C: C. Nothing in the argument relies on whether or not any of the motifs appear exclusively in Sepphoris. The argument relies only on the fact that there are motifs depicting animals not native to Sepphoris.
Explanation D: D. The argument requires only that at least some of the animals in the mosaics are identifiable as known species that are non-native to Sepphoris.
Explanation E: E. Correct. If there was a common repertory of mosaic designs with which artisans who lived in various parts of the Roman Empire were familiar, then it could well be that artisans native to Sepphoris would have been familiar with these designs and could have produced them without ever having seen for themselves animals of the species depicted and without having been the same artisans who created the mosaics elsewhere. Therefore, the argument must assume that such a common repertory did not exist.

You are a GMAT expert specializing in Critical Reasoning. Your task is to analyze the argument presented in the passage and answer the question that follows. Focus on identifying the premises, conclusion, assumptions, and logical fallacies in the argument. Make sure to go through answer choice and reason out why each choice is correct or incorrect.

### Context:
As a large corporation in a small country, Hachnut wants its managers to have international experience, so each year it sponsors management education abroad for its management trainees. Hachnut has found, however, that the attrition rate of graduates from this program is very high, with many of them leaving Hachnut to join competing firms soon after completing the program. Hachnut does use performance during the program as a criterion in deciding among candidates for management positions, but both this function and the goal of providing international experience could be achieved in other ways. Therefore, if the attrition problem cannot be successfully addressed, Hachnut should discontinue the sponsorship program.

### Question:
In the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?
A: A. The first describes a practice that the argument seeks to justify; the second states a judgment that is used in support of a justification for that practice.
B: B. The first describes a practice that the argument seeks to explain; the second presents part of the argument’s explanation of that practice.
C: C. The first introduces a practice that the argument seeks to evaluate; the second provides grounds for holding that the practice cannot achieve its objective.
D: D. The first introduces a policy that the argument seeks to evaluate; the second provides grounds for holding that the policy is not needed.
E: E. The first introduces a consideration supporting a policy that the argument seeks to evaluate; the second provides evidence for concluding that the policy should be abandoned. Argument Construction

### Response:
<think>
### Situation: 
 One of Hachnut’s goals is for its managers to have international experience, so it sponsors education abroad for management trainees. Graduates of this program, however, frequently leave the company soon after the training to work for competitors. Even though Hachnut uses trainees’ performance in the program to make placement decisions, it should discontinue the sponsorship program, because both achievement of international experience and assistance in making placement decisions can be achieved in other ways.
### Reasoning: 
 What role do the two portions in boldface play in the argument? The first boldfaced portion introduces the policy of sponsorship of management training abroad. The argument goes on to evaluate this policy in light of the second boldfaced portion—which states that there are alternative ways of accomplishing what the sponsorship is intended to do—and concludes that the program should be discontinued.
Explanation A: A. The argument does not seek to justify the practice described in the first boldfaced portion, and the second portion argues against the practice, not for it.
Explanation B: B. The argument does not seek to explain the practice, but rather to evaluate whether it should be retained.
Explanation C: C. Although the first boldfaced portion does introduce a practice that the argument seeks to evaluate, the second does not provide grounds for holding that the practice cannot achieve its objective, but rather states that there are other means of achieving that objective.
Explanation D: D. Correct. The first boldfaced portion introduces a policy the argument seeks to evaluate. The second states that there are alternative ways to achieve the goal, which provides grounds for holding that the policy is not needed.
Explanation E: E. Although the second boldfaced portion does provide a reason to abandon the policy the argument evaluates, the first does not introduce a consideration supporting that policy, but rather introduces the policy itself.
