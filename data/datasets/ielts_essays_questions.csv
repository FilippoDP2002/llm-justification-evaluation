"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the modern society, people’s work clothes have attracted much concern.Some people hold the view that the style of the staff should not be paid attention to by the manager on the grounds that the work productivity is of importance. Personally, I believe the way they dress completely depends on the type of their company or job.
On the one hand, formal clothes are suitable for profesional jobs as well as in disciplined settings. Several certain jobs such as lawyer, doctor, teacher and even sales people require people dress up smartly and courteously which undoutedly boost confidence and work efficiency.For example, when wearing white blouse in the hospital, doctors may be more aware of the value of their work in order to try their best to fulfill their duty. Futhermore, should they wear smart clothes, they will be respectful towards others, which affects social interaction and be enormously significant to those face-to-face jobs, especially marketing or receptionist.
On the other hand, there are remarkable reasons why a multitude of individuals  hold the notion that using formal clothes is unnecessary. First of all, clothings are not reflective of the worker’s own performance or their ability. For instance, technological company like Google and Facebook are well-known for their relaxed dress codes because they aim to create an informal, exciting and creative environment; consequently, they produce sophisticated and convenient products despite casual clothes. Secondly, informal clothes are oustanding choices for not only sedentary work styles but also active employess. Loose clothes help relax their muscles, bring comfort and their actions will not be limited.
In conclusion, although clothing does not reflex one’s ability to work, the style of people should be appropriate for their jobs. While in professional setting formal clothes increase people’s self-confidence together with the work productivity and show respect to other people, casual clothes make the staff relaxed and also be convenient for moving employees.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially inetligent robots.


What is your opinion?","Robotic technology is relatively new in our life. As we can imagine, this science will be developed more in the future. However, it has already started to replace some people's positions. Is it possible for all jobs will be done by AI robots? In my opinion, lots of professions could be done by them. 

Physical work could be done by robots because they design for human needs. For example, a small engine could help a surgeon to doctor or a strong one could work instead of a human. They don't get tired or sick. In addition, they would protect people from dangerous situations. For instance, harmful weather conditions such as oxygen level or temperature don't bother them, and even if they them affect, they could be repaired.

In the contrast, there are lots of careers that they can not do. Robots don't have emotions or ethical values. They act like how they codded. For example, if you give a couple of pictures to AI and ask for a new one, it would create an art piece but without any inputs, it can not do. It's same for the music or other kinds of art. Moreover, society always needs psychological help or communication. Again robots can not meet these needs, at least not in close future.

Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"Advertisements take up more and more space in daily life. In my opinion, advertisements increasing day by day is a positive development which can lead to improved competition among the companies and to ensure a growing national economy. 

To begin with, there are positive consequences of advertising increasing day by day for companies and customers. Most important development is that this can ensure more competition among the dominant companies in the market. This leads to companies to increase their product diversity and they try to enhance their customer satisfaction. In this way, customers can have a choice of a better product and better purchase. Take some customers, who have some criteria for choosing a product, for example; they can create an attention-grabbing difference in the quality of product as they are picky people. 

Moreover, this can provide positive development for the national economy. Advertisement can encourage the economic growth of businesses in many different sectors.This promotion firstly owns companies' improvement economically that can be through attracting more customers and then it contributes to their industries that more money is in circulation as both production and consumption increase. All of these may lead to economic welfare which can increase employment and can create new job opportunities. In this way, the country's economy has benefited from the positive effect of these.

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Currently, there are raging debates about whether art is an important subject in academy courses and it can be ignored among most students. Hence, I will scrutinize both aspects in further paragraphs in a student’s view and after analysis, an opinion will be provided.


	To embark on, there are many reasons for supporting other subjects in the children’s school curriculum; initially, learning in modern technology becomes a demanding skill of most professions. If students emphasize only studying arts, they will not be able to gain an opportunity to recruit in advanced companies. Besides that, the essential knowledge of other subjects, like Mathematics and Science, is more highly required in every particular field. Another reason is that arts, notwithstanding being highly appreciated, still do not ensure in student’s career path as most of the fields, such as Engineering, Marketing, IT professional and Management studies are also found in bachelor’s and master’s degree courses.


	On the contrary, art is a creative skill that requires wonderful imagination power. Art allows students to express their feelings and ideas through painting without explaining by words. For instance, once I draw a picture I do not need to be strained and merely relax by imagining throughout a fancy world. Additionally, art also brings laurels to each country and ensures that their cultural inheritance will not extinct. Thus, they are highly paid and appreciated and this kind of respect is not less than flourished careers.


To conclude, there are both sides of advantages and drawbacks to whether art or academic subjects are necessary for students. To compare, the main school subjects are significant for students applying to university. Moreover, most major courses are also required for recruiting in advanced enterprises. In contrast, Art is the cultural symbol of the country that can maintain a stable image of the nation. However, in my perspective, selections of school subjects should depend on students because that will increase the student’s attraction to learn and advocate their career path in the appropriate way as well.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","After completing school life, all teenagers struggle to resolve the problem whether they should enter into a university for a degree or look for a job. Some see more plus points of doing a bachelors degree and start their career life afterwards, while others prefer to start an employment right away without doing further learnings. However, below paragraphs support the first view with reliable supporting ideas as having a degree or same qualification explores a vast range of opportunities for a person.

If an adolescent finds difficult to make a choice between above mentioned options, he or she should pick the option of possessing one or more academic qualifications which are acceptable in the job market. When they own such qualifications, employers ready to offer them amazing salary packages which can never be achieved merely by school leavers. These compensations may consist of vehicle allowances, accommodations, tour packages and so on. As well as, having more academic and professional certificates in someone’s certificate file may open more and more doors into a huge world locally and internationally. This is because, the quality of a job seeker can be measured from qualifications he or she holds based on standards and norms in the job market.

Eventhough enrolling with higher education program is best for the success, all do not get that chance due to various reasons. But, there are number of examples in the world to prove that an academic qualification is not a must to win the life. If someone is interested in becoming expert in some field which experience matters more than the knowledge, he or she can choose that job instead of a degree. Not only that, if they are financially weak to continue learning, they can apply for a job and secure their financial status first.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people think that adolescent-age children should be encouraged to do unpaid volunteering in their spare time. On the contrary, others believe that doing it for free can be prodigal for them. In this essay, I would present that community work can help teenagers to boost their careers and aid society to have a sustainable environment.

Opponents of free community service by teenage children advocate that it can leave a dip in the children's pockets if they are bearing all their expenses with the small amount of pocket money which they get monthly. For example, many unpaid volunteers use their own money during their work to provide instant help to those who are in need. However, I would argue that this can be overcome by doing a part-time job apart from social welfare services. This would help them to earn some money, as well as, acquire time management skills.

Further, I would argue that volunteering helps adolescents to learn how to work in groups. This would help them to grow professionally when they start working in the corporate world.  For instance, they will learn how to perform in a group with people of different opinions and cultural backgrounds. The more they volunteer , the more it will groom their personality and career. Additionally, they can assist in environmental sustainability by spreading awareness among people about the depletion of natural resources and developing a sense of responsibility for saving them . This could help people to learn, how to utilize the resources judiciously and save them for  future generations. Hence, social work can educate society on how to mitigate  further environmental degradation .

In conclusion, while I acknowledge that unpaid community service can be financially non-profitable for teenagers, I would argue that it can be beneficial in their career growth and can help society in  conserving  natural resources.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be

done by artificially intelligent robots.

What is your opinion?","Artificial intelligence and its impact on employment is increasingly becoming a hot topic of debate. While a number of people believe that artificially intelligent robots will replace humans to do all jobs in the long term, there are many who have opposing views. This essay will argue that eventually, most jobs will indeed be done by robots powered by artificial intelligence although not all jobs as believed by some.

Around the world, giant strides have been made with regards to the capacity of artificial intelligent robots to carry out complex tasks typically done by humans in industries like manufacturing, shipping and information technology. These robots are consistently demonstrating higher efficiency levels with cheaper overhead costs than their human counterparts, causing many industry leaders to cut down on their human workforce in favour of adopting robotic systems. For example, Tesla, the global leader in electric vehicle manufacturing, recently announced plans to lay off 20% of its workforce as well as plans to build two new factories across North America that will be fully operated using robots powered by artificial intelligence. Many more of such announcements are expected in the coming decades, corroborating the belief that human beings will be made redundant as more artificially intelligent robots replace them at their jobs. 

However, not all occupations can be efficiently done by these robots. Professions such as prostitution, policing, marketing and customer service require human factors such as empathy and emotions to be delivered efficiently. For instance, studies show that many customers prefer to interact with a human customer service agent over the phone to help resolve their problems, rather than interact with a non-human system. To sum it up, artificial intelligence may never be able to replicate the human factors listed and as such cannot perform tasks that require these factors. 

This essay has argued that artificial intelligence robots will eventually be able to do most jobs and also touched on the fact that not all jobs can be done by these robots. In my opinion, a lot of jobs will be done by robots in the long-term but not all jobs.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.  

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In recent times, it is believed by some that pursuing academic life is the best approach to a successful job, however, others opine that starting a profession right after school would be a better choice; I take the view with the latter. The following essay will discuss both sides and argue the writer’s  viewpoint.

To begin with, many people probably think that acquiring more knowledge by spending time studying at a university or college is of great significance when it comes to candidates' career success. Take an architect for example, becoming aware of the latest architectural methods and research, during his academic years at university while being educated by leading authorities, this person could manage his breakthroughs and become a successful person in his occupation. 

Despite this view, others might believe becoming highly skilled and earning more money just after leaving school bring more benefits. An electrician ,for instance, could possibly become noticeably skilful and even  make a living; above all, he can also become independent at an early age.

In my opinion, I would take the firm conviction that students should better spend some quality time alleviating their skills in their desired field rather than entering universities straight-forward, due to the fact that it will be still possible for them to sign up for a university after realizing the tips and tricks of their career.

In conclusion, although some might prefer the university entrance of candidates without any gaps, I do believe that by facing the work challenges in the real world, students will be able to stand on their own feet.","## Task Achievement:

Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"It is often argued that more and more children facing difficulties to pay attention to their studies in institutions. In this essay, I will explain why the case is so, and give some possible suggestions to eliminate this problem effectively in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, there are many reasons why students are facing difficulties to concentrate on their studies in classrooms. First and foremost, due to enough sleep and lack of nutrition are the one causes of this problem. To illustrate this, nowadays, students are busy solving their assignments, this is because they got more homework from school, and as a result, they have no sufficient time to sleep. In addition, children are more aware to eat fast-food beverages instead of healthy foods for that reason they fall  sick and do not focus on their studies in institutions. For example, fast food like burgers and rolls are more popular food and liked by billion of children but it affects negatively  their health. Also, due to electronic devices students are spending  more time  watching phones and tablets, which is  another reason for this problem.

On the other hand, there are some solutions to eliminate this problem. Firstly, students should take nap properly, which will be helpful for their studies. For example, it is scientifically proven that for better focus on work and study people should sleep at least 8 hours, which helps to relax their mind and grow effectively. Secondly, children should it more healthy foods like apples and oranges which contain more nutrition. Furthermore, teachers should give the minimum amount of homework to their students, which helps children to free and relax their minds and pay better attention during  class periods.

Some people think that illegal internet downloads are having a negative effect on the music industry. Others feel that have little or no impact on artists. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Music helps overcome depression these days. Everyone loves rap. However, some think that unofficial internet downloads are made an adverse repercussion on the music field, while others say that this trend does not create a huge impact on the artists. This essay discusses both viewpoints, I strongly agree with the former opinion for the following reasons. 

On the one hand, unauthorized network downloads affect overall opera profit to the producer, composer and artists. This type of download will affect rap success. For example, one illegal website which is Tamil rockers,  release all new movies songs from their website, people get freely this, the opera producer certainly suffers to get profit. Moreover, this trend might be continued no one watch and listen to the original link. Hence, the illegal song downloads will affect the opera industry, this may be composer will not get another chance for composing songs because everybody load from unauthorized with freely. 

On the other hand, the artist always thinks about their's popularity so, this is not a big issue because legal or illegal any one way people choose to listen to the song this, many songs got success from folks support. For instance, a recently released Tamil movie which is a Master movie song was being released on an unauthorized network, before the authority of a company revealed but that songs have gotten successful, everybody likes them. Hence, many artists do not care about this matter due to they only concentrate on their's famous and popularity. 

To conclude, although both sides have implications. However, in my opinion, about this, unlawful load are getting worse in the music industry because so many composers and producers are affected directly. They obtain loss of this issue and I hope this trend should be stopped and everyone only watches on the original website.","## Task Achievement:

Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays. Many folks believe that only the government  is able to solve this problem. However, from the way I am thinking, I do not agree with this idea.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that one of many government responsibilities is to ensure that the residents have houses to live in. I am convinced that all the councils in the world, regardless of the region where the cities are based. I remember a friend of mine once said that in his home country, the executive prepared and constructed buildings to accommodate the citizens. I was blown away when I heard this and imagined if the government in my homeland do the same thing. However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first. So waiting for the government to singlehandedly solve the housing issue is not a wise move we can do as a resident, especially if we are not from the richest country on this planet.

On top of the government, I strongly believe that other players also play the same key role in this issue, the private sector for instance. They can contribute to tackling the issue in their own ways. Whereas banks can help its customer  get a friendly loan to buy a house, property companies could provide an easy scheme to pay for the houses. Those are only two of many examples of how private sectors are able to help. What I want to say is that only government  can solve this issue. 

To sum up, I do not agree with people who think that only the executive can break down the problem as I strongly believe either government or non-government can help on their own, as aforementioned explanations.","### Task Achievement:

What are the benefits for old people of using mobile phones and internet.

In my opinion, there are many advantages for older people of using smartphones and internet such as communication, exercise and check-up's and many other and some another methods to encourage them, which I shall discuss in the upcoming paragraphs.

Moreover , some individuals liked to go walking and exercises and they wanted to check the number of calories.Thus , they can burn more to become healthier person .

"Money offered for post graduate research is limited; as a consequence ,some people argue that financial support from the government should onlg be provided for scientific research rather than research for less useful subjects.Do you agree or disagree","Due to limited availability of funds foe higher education it is often recommended that financial assistance should be offered to scientific research instead of allocating funds to supplementary subjects.This notion should be accepted as many facts in favour of practical sibjects could be considered.Certainly the major argument in the favour of subsidising science and technology is rooted in the fact that advancement in science and technology not only reflects the prosperity of the  nations but also vouchsafes the other domains .To illustrate it can be said that investments in scientific research  including diagnostic and curative measure ensure the sound health of its people.Secondly it also paves a way towards the holistic development of a country by facilitating innovations and discoveries .

Another compelling reason might  be due to unreservedly salience of science in terms of boosting the economy and living standards of the country.

However one might argue that the importancd of supplementary subjects such as economics and statistics should not be neglected as it assists the nation in policy formation and analysing the currend situation.Thereforce an equal proportion of the financial assistant is required for these areas.

"Some people think the technology makes life complex, so we should make the life simpler without using the technology.

According to some group of people or community thinks that due to technology our life has become too composite. So, we should do something that our life easier without using the technology.

Restoration of old buildings in main cities involves enormous government expenditure. It would be more beneficial to spend this money to build new houses and roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.,"In this day and age, people often believe that the government should allocate more funds to the construction of new houses as well as road systems rather than the restoration of old buildings since this activity can waste a large amount of money. In my opinion, old buildings often have a lot of historical and artistic significance, although restoration of these constructions can have high costs and main cities have great issues related to living and housing, I tend to disagree with this statement.

On the one hand, there are buildings that are worth restoring because of their historical or symbolic significance. Their preservation is part of the culture and can serve a great deal for education, getting to know a people's origin, legends, and capabilities. When buildings get to be restored, this legacy is protected. For example, Hanoi Old Quarter is one of the historical sites of Hanoi and is a place where there are a lot of tourists every year, so it needs funds from the government to develop and protect.

On the other hand, in big cities, tax money should be allocated to provide adequate housing and construct more roads to accommodate the increasing population. More and more people from suburban regions migrate to urban areas in search of work. This has caused the population density in certain cities to rise remarkably, bringing in its wake negative outcomes such as traffic congestion and crowded living quarters. Using tax money to build more houses, therefore, provides people with affordable shelters that low-income people could purchase. 

In conclusion, I agree that constructing more houses and roads is important and should generally be prioritized over maintaining old buildings with the exception of historically significant constructions. I believe this should be the approach for most cities.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think the technology makes life complex, so we should make the life simpler without using the technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree","Certain individuals are of the notion that technology makes things even more laborious ergo,things would be less tasking in its absence. In my opinion, I vehemently disagree with this school of thought because technology since its introduction, has been ameliorating all aspects of life, medicine in particular. 

      To begin with, innovation has improved the health sector greatly. The use of high-tech equipment in medicine has helped improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of diseases while at the same time reducing the stress medical practitioners undergo. Evidence of this can be seen in article released by the Chancellor of School of Medicine, Ukraine who stated that medicine had moved a milestone since the introduction of technology to improve diagnosis by detecting diseases as little as inconspicuous tumors to severe diseases such as kidney stones and has also helped treatment of cancer with the use of  radiology. Additionally, the use of technology in medical work has led to advancement in research works. Scientists have been able to synthesize new and effective cure or vaccines to combat infections. 

      Furthermore, technology has helped in the improvement of education worldwide. Teachers from a distance have been able to successfully impact knowledge to their pupils with the use of devices such as iPads and projectors and these devices were used to teach even in the absence of the teacher. For instance, the online learning approach has been adopted my almost all schools nationwide as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak and this has helped so many schools complete their syllabi and even hold graduation virtually. Furthermore, technology has helped bolster relationships across continents. A lot of people these days are engaging in long distance relationships and this would have been almost impossible without the use of technology. Phones, tablets with strong internet connection has helped these relationships stand the test of time.  

      In conclusion, while other opinions may vary, I strongly disagree the opinion that life would be easier without technology because of its impact in ameliorating every sector of our lives is evidently seen.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"Several reports in  top-rated newspapers around the globe have confirmed and encouraged young generations to have the opportunity to learn from their community on the weekends or after school hours. According to some people’s opinion, youth should spend their free time on non-remunerated jobs to increase their social and future job skills.  In this essay, I will summarize it would benefit the community.

Firstly, many people can say that if teenagers  do  community work, they will avoid any negative actions against their own community. Working for the community increases the value of helping others as well as the sense of belonging and makes them stop reacting negatively forward with what they have built. For instance, in New York, there is extra work  implemented after school where aggressive kids grow their own plants in the community garden to keep them calm, show them how to give to the community and value their work and effort. 

Secondly, non-paid community work should allow the youth to learn some social abilities to relate deeply to society that they have never been taught in school. People gain a wider range of experiences once they start their adult life. This may lead to new ideas for cohesion in  society or a greater feeling of individual fulfilment after the work done in the community. As a result, collectivity is created as a benefit of all these activities. For example, a few studies centres in Europe have as an extracurricular subject at school where people get together in a range of nonprofit activities focused on helping many people in need.

To sum up, young adults would benefit from social activities that make them avoid negative behaviour toward their own neighbourhood. Also, learning useful skills to improve the relationship with others and gathering to support each other.  From my point of view, I completely agree with the idea of young generations spending free time helping other people in exchange for life lessons and foment higher connection with a society which reduces any kind of attacks on the community and the number of problems in  society.","**Task Achievement:**

More and more people are seriously overweight. Some people suggest the solution to this problem is to increase the price of fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?i,"Many people are consuming junk food which leads then them to gain extra weight. It is often argued that increasing the price of oily food might tackle this situation. I completely agree with this and therefore, in this essay, i will discuss and provide a worthy conclusion.

The trend of consuming unhealthy food is increasing day by day. To mitigate this issue, raising the prices of junk food will make it less pocket friendly for people to consume it on daily basis. As most of the people are earning that much that they have to make a budget for everything thus  if prices are increased they will start eating in fewer quantities. To support this reason, if companies increase the prices of their packaged and junk food thrice the cost as they used to be people will buy less quantity. This is to say that  more the price lower will be the consumption capacity.

Another point, in this case,this case is that, when the cost of unhealthy food goes up, companies will reduce the production capacity. As the prices go up , consumers will cut down their buying capacity, companies will suffer losses and hence they will have to stop releasing processed food. This will encourage them to make healthy snacks. By doing this it will also encourage their customers to buy healthy food and decrease the chances of getting obese.

In conclusion, increasing prices of fattening foods will decrease the feasibility of having to access them. I entirely agree that making unhealthy snacks unaffordable will encourage companies to launch healthy and affordable snacks.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.,"Nowadays, environmental pollution is increasing day by day, and this is of great concern in these communities. Thence, some people contemplate that increasing the price of fuels such as coal, gas, gasoline for cars and other vehicles is one of the best solution. In my opinion, it may be  the right way, however, this is not the only solution to tackle this problem. 

To begin with, increasing the pay of crude oil can help to some degree, but there is more disadvantage. In the other words, if the union raises the fee of fossil fuel unreasonably, the cost increase will cause more problems. For example, when the price of fuel is increased unreasonably, other sectors that run gasoline face more  and more problems, and the prices rise sharply. As a result, poor and middle class families encounter many difficulties, and protest among the people will intensify against the state. Moreover, the increase in the cost of gasoline will not stop air pollution.

On the other hand, the power should be developed in renewable energy source such as, wind, solar and tide rather than non renewable resource like coal and petrol. For example, today, many countries are using renewable resources. The government encourages people to use public transportation by improving public transportation and reducing the cost of travelling. As a result, emissions of harmful gases are reduced into the atmosphere, and  non renewable energy resources are saved.

To conclude, I strongly believe that the use in the renewable energy sources is  one of the best solution to this problem. So, every country should use a renewable resource.","## Task Achievement:

people believe that teeagers should be require to do unpaid community work in therefore in their time this can benefit teenager and the community as well. To what extant do you agree or disagree.,"Teenagers are the future of the world.On the other hand,they are young and energetic and to utilise them in social work is a very  good idea indeed.But,at the same time,we have to consider what aspect we can give them by offering unpaid social tasks? In my essay,I shall enlighten  the benefits of their works  and I totally agree that they can bring some good changes to the neighbourhood through their services.

Firstly, the young generation can do some free teaching services to the poor ,needy children.These will help  to develop some leading capacity among themselves as well as ,it will bring some development in literacy sector .On the other hand, arranging some sports competition and cultural functions can be done by the young generation, which will encourage society to be healthy and entertained.For instance ,last year the annual game in our area was arranged by some young boys and girls,was so entertaining.The  residents were so excited about it .And surprisingly ,after the programme ,the morning exercise and evening walk participants  increased  significantly.

However,nowadays  teenagers are busy with their study and exams.and above all,some of them like to pass their time in binge-watching.So,it is definitely a very good step for them if  they are interested to give a hand in social work though it is unpaid.But good work is always precious.Like a smile on children's face when they are participating in athletics or activities cannot be measure in money.It is immensely valuable.

"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.
Do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that forcing young children to do voluntary work during their leisure time would not only have a positive impact on themselves but also on their societies. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this statement because it distorts and demolishes the inner essence of volunteer.  

Some would claim that asking teenagers to volunteer in projects during their free time would provide this category a well-round perspective about the importance of helping others without expecting any monetary return from this work. This is because they tend to waste their time in doing useless activities, such as playing video games and chatting with their friends online, which diverts their attention from focusing on allocating time for giving back to their community. For that reason, it would open their mind to the virtues of contributing to their societies.

Although this way might teach teenagers about the advantages of doing unpaid work to themselves as well as their communities, it would not help them to effectively embrace the concept of volunteering. This is because if they are forced to volunteer, it would become more challenging for them to understand the moral value of offering aid to others, and therefore they are more likely to find excuses to avoid giving back to their communities and start thinking of what benefit themselves only. A typical example of this is that when a school ask young students to participate in charities campaigns such as cleaning parks, and taking care of elderly after school, a high proportion of them never shows up or expresses their dissatisfaction as they believe that they are still having the freedom to choose how to spend their time. 

As a result, teenagers could form wrong opinions and ideas about volunteering. 

To sum up, requiring youngers to perform voluntary work whenever they have time would help them to understand how this work could contribute to their personality and societies. However, I would disagree with this point of view because it might push them to discard the valuable lesson they could get from this job.","**Task Achievement:**

some people think the best way to solve global enviromental problems is to increase the cost of fuel to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Intro: It is sometimes believed that the government should add the price of gas in order to tackle environmental issues in the world. This essay strongly supports the statement due to two core reasons; firstly, car exhaust fumes generate a high amount of carbon dioxides in the air, which contributes to global warming. Secondly, gas stations may cause a danger to the wildlife in the area. 

To start with, vehicles produce a high amount of carbon dioxide through the exhaust pipe. Which causes global warming. In other ,words The gradual increase in the overall temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere is due to the greenhouse effect. This effect is caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide and other gases in the air, many of them released by human activity.

For instance, in Mongolia government increased the cost of fuel everybody was ditching their cars and started buying bicycles in order to, fight against the cost of the gas 

More importantly, around the area of the gas station’s environments are highly damaged and diseased then it is extremely bad for the wildlife. That means if wild animals eat deceased land it is not only bad for their health but also could cause mutation in the process of breeding. For ,instance in the USA there are lots of mutated animals because of this deceased land. So in order to help wildlife and land around the gas station, the government needs to increase the price of the gas.

"Some people say that increasing business and cultural contacts between countries is a positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The world is witnessing an increase in interdependence amongst countries in terms of business and cultural contacts. Some people assume that this trend is a positive development while others think it will create risks to survival of national identities. In this essay, I will discuss both views and indicate my opinion.
It is undeniable that widening international exchange brings a range of opportunities for countries to grow their economies. In other words, organizations may take advantage of this trend to gain more revenues from expanding their markets and approaching a large number of potential customers all over the world.  For example, without globalization, Apple Inc only sells their products in the domestic market, this may prevent them from gaining incredible growth and a good reputation as one of the most well-known technology companies nowadays. In the matter of cultural contacts, promoting cultural exchanges betweens nations also contributes to increasing global coverage of a country’s culture to world friends. The more convenient developing mutual relationship between countries means international tourism, exhibitions and fairs, TV programmes and films, etc. where people may enjoy the achievements of other cultures across the globe become more ubiquitous. As a result, they not only enrich inhabitants’ lives but also lay a foundation to preserve and develop cultural  quintessences including cuisine, costume and festivals. 
In contrast to the benefits mentioned above, this trend also brings many threats to a national identity. To be more specific, the fact that the world gradually becomes a giant village makes its inhabitants tend to use a common language like English as an inevitable trend. As a result, there are a variety of minor languages on the verge of extinction and the world is getting less linguistically diverse because of the lack of emphasis on mother tongue. Another noticeable phenomenon is that traditional values in a country fall into a state of neglect as introductions of foreign cultures. Considering the situation of the young generation in Vietnam as an example, they are in favor of  songs, films produced by Korean compared to traditional folk songs and domestic films. 
From my point of view, two arguments truly reflect the possible consequence of an increasing economic and cultural interaction among nations. It boosts economic integration and enhances modernization but also creates tensions between global culture and a country’s national identity. However, participating in the process of globalization depends on the willingness of each nation, they have the right not to participate if they feel that national benefits are threatened.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that competitive sports have a positive effect on the education of teenagers while others argue that the effect is negative.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Sports play an essential role in the child’s positive mindset. Some people believe that competition in sports is beneficial for teenagers,however others are of the view that it imparts negativity among young kids. It is essential to examine both sides of the argument diligently. 

On the one hand, competitive sports inculcate lots of positive effects on a child’s mind. To begin with, a child learns the value of teamwork when they play as a team. The teamwork is invariably the most important characteristic, that comes in handy at the time when a person starts working. Secondly, a healthy competition enables an adolescent to go the extra mile just to win the game. The importance of losing and winning is clearly understood. This results in pushing their boundaries and doing the same in education as well.

On the other hand, there are some unavoidable byproducts of  sports events. The most critical effect of these competitions is the loss of motivation. A teenager becomes low on confidence and is always in need of motivation. Therefore, this impact greatly in further health issues. For instance, panic attacks or nervous breakdown. Moreover, sometimes feud or a sense of hatred inevitably arise when competing with someone. That is another crucial reason for consideration.

In conclusion, playing sports with the goal of winning against someone has both positive and negative impacts on adolescents. Although, a child being underconfident and generating hatred are enormous consequences, yet I believe it is necessary for a child to possess competitiveness to succeed in life.","## Task Achievement:

"Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies.
To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? 


What measures can be taken to protect them?","In today’s world, the fierce rivalry among business entities has given rise to a proliferating number of advertisements broadcast on almost every means of media. While this phenomenon is not without positive influence, its adverse implications are more significant. Therefore, there will be some solutions proposed in this essay to  diminish its negative effects on consumers.

 

Needless to say, a rise in the number of advertisements has allowed viewers to be more well-informed of the newly-launched products. Given the unprecedented rate of technological advancement in recent years, without these means of marketing, consumers may fall behind the most innovative features introduced to the market, which may impede them from making  sensible purchasing decisions. However, such surge in adverts may bring about some underlying effects on purchasing behavior. Since consumers are constantly bombarded with advertising in various manifestations, they are more prompted to make a purchase without thorough consideration. It stands to the reason  that promotional campaigns are designed to prey on humans’ insecurities such as their inferiorities in physical appearance or their desire for social inclusion; as a result,  viewers are more liable to fall victim to buying unnecessary items out of spontaneity. Moreover, the competitiveness among companies has led advertisers to resort to dishonest tactics with the sole aim to boost sales. The most widely adopted strategy seems to exaggerate the true values of the advertised products, which induces the consumers to take preference of them and may lead to future purchases.

 

There are some possible solutions to tackle the problems engendered from such a trend. The most prominent responsibility should lie with the government since they are those who grant permission for adverts to be broadcast on mass media. Therefore, there should be a board  of experts whose job is to screen, monitor and cross-reference the advertisement contents and their actual effectiveness. The public should also take actions to protect themselves. It is recommended that before buying an item, one should do some research by either consulting the previous buyers  or taking their needs and affordability into serious consideration. With all of these measures joining forces, consumers are more liable to be well-protected from the invasion of misleading advertising.

 

In short, advertisements, with its  genuine nature , should provide useful information about new products in the market. However, given the tough competition between companies, this marketing tool may  provoke spontaneous purchasing decisions. Therefore, both the government and its citizens should take proactive measures in order to foster a healthy society.","**Task Achievement:**

"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their childen to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In contemporary society, every parent has plenty of school options available for providing a bedrock for learning. Some parents incline towards unisex learning institutes. However, a fraction of people believes that  gender-specific colleges can have demerits for  youngsters later in life. I agree with this statement to some extent due to a variety of concerns. This essay will expound on both sides of the argument and will provide a conclusion after discussing the demerits and merits of both types of  schooling.

On the one hand, few parents give priority to single-sex schools due to a number of concerns with the co-education system. One major concern related to mixed education is the safety of female students. For instance, According to a few research surveys, it is proved that the safety of female students is a major concern for their parents due to cases of sexual harassment from male figures. Another big reason for  selecting a gender-specific school is a more comfortable atmosphere in the gender-specific institute. As mostly females feel more comfortable and secure in a girls' campus where they can openly discuss their personal issues such as menstruation cycle and other illnesses, which can not be discussed openly in a co-learning system.

On the other hand, few people insist on giving priority to the co-education system due to various factors. Firstly, one of the big factors is a lack of confidence in most of the students who belong to gender-specific institutions. These students don't have enough confidence to express their views with other genders. Most of them can not hold a conversation and can not get attention in front of a large audience. Moreover, students who learn in a co-education system have more confidence and interpersonal skills which make them more successful in later stages of life.

In conclusion,  I vehemently oppose the idea of single-sex educational institutions. In my opinion, the co-education system provides more learning opportunities for youngsters. Consequently, the co-education system should be supported by parental figures to provide a better future for the young generation.","## Task Achievement:

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. In this essay, I will explain why social skills are more vital, compared with academic qualifications.

The merits of outstanding social skills are apparent. Firstly, communication is the key to career success in this day and age. This is mainly due to the fact that the 21st century is best characterised by constant interaction with different people, no matter the communication happens in person or online. Secondly, the ability to sell products or services is of paramount significance in any business – this requires strong social skills. For example, an employee with excellent social skills is able to have an impact in front of customers or clients; as a result, products or services can be perceived as high-value. Furthermore, employees with better social skills are generally more easy-going, which is very important to the workplace, including the employer. After all, as the saying goes, “Who you work with is as important as what you do.” – An enjoyable work environment needs socially skilful employees.

In contrast, some others may claim that academic qualifications are the pre-requisite of employment. Apparently, many positions require certain qualifications. However, in modern-day society, more and more employers have realised that whether employees can get the results that the business wants is the key to a business’ success. It can be seen that qualifications do not play a key role in this regard.

Having considered both views, I think employees’ social skills are of overriding importance for an organisation. Also, I would suggest employers consider job applicants’ social skills first, which I believe is soundly based on the above reasoning I have presented.","### Task Achievement:

"some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this? How can people research","More and more people from all around the world are willing to find out about the history behind the house or building they live in. There are many reasons given to explain this strange wish. Firstly, learning about the history of their house teaches people to appreciate the place they live in. When people truly understand the true meanings or intentions of a place, they will learn to love that place not just for the beautiful scenery or modern faculties, but for the actual sentimental value that it holds. That is what brings people peace and joy. Secondly, people may find items or things that could be financially beneficial. When you dig deep into a house's history, there is a percentage that your house is associated with a historical event and there could be hidden items remaining from that time that could bring you a fortune. For example, there was a YouTube video of people who were researching their house's history and they found out that there was a piece of actual Jerusalem in the middle of the house. They later tried to sell the house and plenty of agencies offered them millions of US dollars. Lastly, being able to learn about your own house's story could be something to be proud of. Researching the history of an unknown place is not easy so people should be proud of themselves if they were able to. The story of the family who owns the house with Jerusalem in it impressed people from all around the world and inspired them to find out about their own house's history as well. The easiest way for people to know the background of their house is to ask the previous owners of that place because they might know a thing or two about it. Alternatively, people can research by themselves on the internet to try to understand the historical meanings behind their homes.","## Task Achievement:

"Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays.
What are the reasons for this?
What can be done to solve this problem?","Schools play an important role in the development of our brains. Nowadays a large number ofstudent feel that it is hard to concentrate and they are not able to give their full attention in school. In this essay, I will outline what is the potential reasons for this particular problem and what we can do to resolve

 this.

There is  a lot of reasons that Student are not able to concentrate in school, the major reason is 

smartphone with social media. Obviously, when these kids use Smartphones they not only watch 

videos online but also waste a lot of time on social media. As a result, they lose their concentration which hinders their close attention. for instance, a study has concluded that everyone these days has 

problem with concentration cause they are spending a lot of time in front of the mobile screen. Another reason is that nowadays these juveniles are very enthusiastic, they want to get everything in their life very early. therefore, instead of living in present with the full ,attention they waste their precious time thinking about the future.  

On the other hand, to resolve these problems public and the government both should have to perform their duties otherwise it will be a disaster for the student in future. To resolve this problem parents need to keep eye on their kids and let them know that they should not spend their precious time spending on scrolling Facebook and Instagram. government should work with these social media companies and make some restrictions on using these platforms.

Human activities have negative effects on plants and animals all over the world. Some people think it is too late to do something about it. Others think there is still some time to take actions. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"human activities have dramatically changed totall environment of the world. Some people belive that there is no chance to improve the habitat, however others think there is still enough time to improve it. There are rational arguments on both sides of this topic which will be discussed in detail, followed by my own view.
On the one hand, earth looks like a dead place in comparison with past. Most of the places that were full of trees and animals have been changed as if they are desert. Moreover, green gases and global warming cause drastically climate and environmental changes. For example, considerable numbers of lakes are do not have any water and they are dry. Thus, there is no chance to return habitat to condition of several years ago, whatsoever.
On the other hand, most parts of the world are in a good condition as like there were nobody on there. Government authorities and people can have essential roles on improving earth condition. For example, goverments should invest more on researching new generation technologies to solve green gas problem or people take part in charity affairs to clean rivers and habitat from rubbish. So, under no circumstances is it acceptable to be disapointed from one issue that can be solve.

1.Some school leavers travel or work for a period of time instead of going directly to university. What are the advantages and disadvantages for their studies?,"It has been observed that teenagers tend to discontinue their studies after completing them, instead of getting accepted into college. This scenario has several advantages and disadvantages, all of which will be discussed in detail.

Discussing the benefits of the above, the main advantage is that young people can learn about different cultures. What I mean by that is that when students travel the world during breaks, they learn about different traditions, languages and social skills. So, their lifestyle changes, and they become multilingual. In addition, students gain practical experience while working part-time. In other words, students learn how to manage their finances effectively, expand their understanding of business concepts, and explore opportunities for continued education. For example, a survey conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's admissions department showed that possessing all of these abilities enables students to outperform others academically.

Despite the benefits of this situation, it also has some implications. The most important reason is that students lose motivation. To account for this, the information in their head disappears within a year of graduating from high school. As a result, learners will struggle to acquire knowledge from new courses while pursuing their degree education. Moreover, gaps necessitate meticulous preparation. In detail, during this time, if they cannot find projects or jobs, he/she may experience serious problems such as anxiety. This could lead him/her to engage in illegal activities like theft and drug use.

In summary, it can be said that every situation has both advantages and disadvantages. It is a fair idea to take a break and find your major before choosing a university course; however, without executing a perfect plan, learners lose focus on their studies and work.","## Task Achievement:

Research indicates that nowadays some consumers are much less influenced by advertising than in the past. What do you think are the reasons for this? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"Currently, there are some studies finding that advertisement is less likely to impact some people than before. Several factors may relate to this phenomenon which I believe is a positive development.  

   

The advent of this trend is complex, possibly involving many factors. Firstly, advances in network technology allow people to get access to the products information easier, making the advertisement less attraction than before. For example, details of many products can be accessed by consumers through their official websites rather than watching their advertisement. Another reason is that more and more offline stores have been established and they are important channels for people to learn the goods. The advantages are obvious, because these physic stores fulfill people's curious while avoiding them to spend a lot to buy the expensive goods. Besides, people can get information from some product launches as many large companies like Apple and Google, will introduce their new products before they are provided to the market.  

   

I think this is a positive trend which means that people are more reasonable to choose their interested goods. Only a few product details that the producers want customers to see can be transmitted by advertisement, which may mislead some people to buy. The availability of various approaches for people to acquire product data facilitate them selecting the truly helpful items that they really need, without spending some unnecessary fees.   

   

Overall, many reasons may lead to less influences of advertisement on some consumers, and in my view, there are more positive effects than the negative.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their acheivements, and this sets a bad example to young people.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that there is a tendency to be well-known because of the luxurious life conditions, whereas people maintaining achievements and reaching their goals remain unknown. Personally, I completely agree that this sets a bad example to the younger generation because I believe that only those who succeed in life and work to boost specific fields of society can actually inspire them. 

First and foremost, famous people are pursued by youngsters and teenagers. This means that younger generations are being grown up by celebrities, namely bloggers in social media. Following successful people, who get fame thanks to their abilities and skills such as Elon Musk, is more beneficial for teenagers to get motivation together with incentives to strive to study and have a purpose to attain achievements rather than giving preference to effortless and mesmerizing lifestyles of wealthy ones. Secondly, there is a danger to the personality traits of youngsters because of pursuing bloggers who provide unhealthy diets and curse words in their speeches. Thus, it is advantageous to follow scientists or influencers who are making breakthroughs in technology or science. 

Let us take a look at the mental conditions of followers. Nowadays, it is a crucial issue to have a low interest in life and be under a lot of strain because of seeing others' lifestyles and desire to have it. For instance, pursuing others’ life may lead to dissatisfaction and criticism of their life because of not having the ability to afford an astonishing lifestyle. In conclusion, following wealthy and rich celebrities provide more drawbacks than positive outcomes. 

To conclude, I strongly believe that for everyone it would be beneficial to pursue celebrities who reached goals and success in their life because it may be a source of motivation to attain their own achievements.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is a common belief among certain individuals that teenagers should be mandated to contribute to their community with free service. This essay completely agrees with this statement and explains how both young adults and residents are benefited from such an arrangement.

Firstly, selfless community service allows young students to be prepared and excel in their adult years because it builds their personality to be altruistic. This is because sacrificing your own time and making significant efforts for others are two of the most important qualities demanded by a leadership position. For example, one study conducted by Forbes magazine concluded that about 80 percent of CEOs have served at least 160 hours for the betterment of society. Thus, helping the needy in early childhood benefits young people by enhancing their leadership traits.

Secondly, locals are benefitted due to the amazing contributions of a vibrant and dynamic workforce and free help. Since teens are physically more active, they can better take care of physically demanding tasks such as lifting weights, enduring long hours of work, and helping the elderly to walk around. Moreover, some local institutions, which can not afford to hire more people, can take advantage of these energetic individuals because of the unpaid job that they are doing. For instance, my local elderly care home has 90% of teenagers, who are studying in nearby schools, as employees. 

In conclusion, some people think that extracurricular volunteering activities should be compulsory for teenagers. In my opinion, it should be mandatory as it not only benefits teenagers' persona but also provides society with an incomparable and very economical workforce.","### Task Achievement:

"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","There is no arcane that the world has been revolutionized with a trend like self reliance. These days, the autonomy is at its zenith. In the modern world, this practice has increased with alacrity. 
There is no dilemma, these days more novice people prefer to be independent after high school. This practice is common in developed countries rather than third world countries.
No doubt, there are a plethora of benefits of being independent. Such as, “The fortune favours the brave” the autonomous person have an edge over others because they are ready to take effective risks. If we focus on successful nations, we will notice that its young people are comparatively hardworking. Also, CBN news survey, provided that independent people are lauded to broaden their horizons and lead an appeasing life. As they become more responsible by efficiently taking care of their household and daily life tasks. Instead of pestering their parents, they earn and chase their dreams in a lithe manner. To meet their needs, they become goal-oriented and do part time jobs. Which also gives a rapid-dramatic boom in the country’s economy. As wise people constitute wise nations. It also proves to be an ample tool in controlling the crime rate of the country. As a result, the childish and wanton activities are decried effectively. 
On the contrary, such people lack family time. As they become cynical and self centred. There is a family gap between parents and children. The direct consequence of belonging to such group is psychic issues e-g such people are in the jaws of loneliness and stress problems. Another grave and critical issue of standing on its own is management issues. For instance, “no man is an island” every person need someone to some extent. And such people pay the piper in practical life because they don’t have any guidelines and someone to learn the experiences of. Such as the footsteps of their father and a father is mostly the first role model in one’s life. Moreover, the darker side of this practice is that young people often get spoiled. For example, some grow dangerous and harmful habits like drugs, gambling and other social evils.

Some people believe  that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligence Roberts.What is your opinion?,"Artificially intelligent robots will take over the human workforce in the future. Although, all the easy skill jobs will be done by robots, but still some skillfull work will require human contacts. This essay will discuss why some jobs will still be undertaken manually. 

Robots may be replaced to carry forward the jobs that are not too complex and can easily perform without much involvement by humans.As it will be beneficial for multinational companies and industries to gain profits through artificial intellect instead of spending highly on hiring, training and employing the human. For instance, in may metropolitan cities the traffic personnel are replaced by an automatic traffic control system which is far more cost effective. In addition, this system works around the clock and require no holiday.

For these reasons computers and robots will be involved in human lives more frequently in the upcoming future.

Conversely, there are some skillfull jobs that are interdependent on human relations and emotions, and that this job cannot be handled by automated robots. Likewise, the jobs where the human mind, soul and his own natural brilliance is more crucial rather than only the profit conquered by the artificial brilliance. These jobs include psychology, education, medicines and some social jobs needed for the betterment of the society. All in all, robots cannot perceive human nature that has performed this social evolution since hundred and thousands of years ago. 

To sum up, a significant number of jobs will be control of the artificial intellect in the future.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","There is an increaing tendency amongst the pubic in some nations who want to know more about the history of the house or building they live in. This trend could be out of curiosity or related to some economic issues. This essay will explore the reasons for  this trend especially in Korea and the United Kingdom and how to investigate the helpful information. 

To begin in Korea, people usually look into info about a house or building when they have an opportunity to buy it. In terms of individual assets, real estate is the most important and the biggest one, therefore people should be well aware of the information about the property when they try to make contracts. In Korea, brand-new apartments are more expensive. In other words, that’s the reason that the society has tons of interests in redevelopment. Where a cluster of old houses exists, there are always lots of attempts to develop the area and make some money there. When it comes to the investment, it is crucial for investors to be acquainted with the practical data like the initial construction date, the original purpose of the house and so on. Since this can be the key in order to succeed in the business regarding reconstruction and the investment also.

In the United Kingdom, on the other hand, it is quite the opposite. The older the building is, the more valuable. This makes sense since houses are not only capable of making a warm and cosy environment but also bear invaluable events from the past in their concrete walls and structures. In other words, residences with some special  stories make them more attractive and naturally the prices of those would be higher than others. Some are just curious about the stories laid under the old villas that have gotten through tons of historical events, yet others wants to know about it since they can presume the value of the dwellings from that messages. 

Turning to the research, there are various ways to collect the relevant information. The simplest way is to ask to the previous owners or real estate agencies. In addition, visiting local libraries are another good option. In regard to practical data, we can gather useful reports from the website of the city council.

"Some people say that parents have more important roles to play in children development.However, others argue that friends and television have the most significant influence. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Children, since their birth, are always in learning mode. Either from their parents or from their surroundings, i.e. friends, television, society at large. As children are young, they will observe and follow their parents at early stage and then will learn from their playmates and classmates in their early years.

At early stage, parents will be their primary soruce of contact and thus will guide them through basic life skills.  They will be primary soruce of education in early stage development basic commuication skills which would have long lasting effect and thus play an important role. Initial activities like crawl, walk, speech and other basic actions are mostly influenced by parents.

As the time passes and childern are introduced to the playgroups and then school, they will have an added development source in form of their playmates and classmates. They will then begin the next stage of learning, which would be more social and educational in nature and thus, shape their life in society and field of formal learning. As the ally-in-class helps a child with any specific challange in study, T.V. in a regulated environment, serves as an ally-at-home, helps child to know better of unknown world.

As seen above, both the sources are somewhat improtant than the other at some point of the children's life. One without the another, in a required degree of influence, would not be helpful for overall development of children. 

Thus, in my opinion, I would say, both parents as well as friends and television are important for a mulit-faciet development of kid's life. And as, development is a never ending process, both would be required in relevant proportions at each life stage of development of the child.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this?
 How can people research this?","In some countries, there is a bigger trend in researching the history related to the places where people are living. I think the main reasons behind this can be seen as curiosity and education purposes, the best way is to get information from older people.

Firstly, some people are very curious to know the myths behind older buildings. In many developed countries, there are fewer older buildings because these buildings have been demolished for modern building constructions. Therefore people are trying to get details on how these places were before and the rumors around them.

Secondly, many people who are learning about historical areas are keen to find them for their education purpose. It is very hard to find the details on older buildings like who lived, which kind of material they used, the appearance of those houses, and the difference between the houses of the rich and poor. If people can find these details they can come up with clear ideas on how it was in earlier days. 

Thirdly, the best way to find out these details is by talking to older people who live in these areas. The older generation has seen how these places become changed over their whole life since they lived in the same area and they experienced all the changes that happened around them. People can get to know a lot of real stories behind the buildings from them.

Human activities have negative effects on plants and animals all over the world. Some people think it is too late to do something about it. Others think there is still some time to take actions. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, when our society is in the stage of rapid transformation, a tendency to increase the number of available activities can be seen and a lot of them are considered to be harmful. It is agreed ,that people make environment suffer from these and some of the negative impacts are irreparable,however, others claim that some measures can be taken to save nature. This essay,firstly,will discuss how people's actions can influence nature in an adverse way without hope to fix it,followed by an analysis of what solutions can be suggested,before coming to a reasoned conclusion.

To begin with, some activities considered to be really dangerous for forest habitats,such as hunting. Unfortunately, the majority of people do not understand the difference between farm animals who were grown to be killed for eating purposes and the habitats of the wild environment. Moreover, some species are at the edge of extinction due to people's inappropriate behaviour. In addition, there are other types of activities which harm animals,such as feeding bread to birds,as it swells in their stomach and makes them suffer from pain,which can lead even to their death. Also, for example, weeds ,which are considered to be harmful to plants, have a positive impact on soil,because they can help to defend plants from insects,but people remove them repeatedly and it leads to a decrease in the amount of them.

On the other hand, it is extremely important to provide people with information about the consequences which their actions can cause. Furthermore, the government should make a system of high fines ,in order to defend plans and animals,because the majority of people do not understand the importance of saving nature. For example, feeding bread to birds is considered to be a good action ,as someone thinks that they help animals, nevertheless, if they knew about real outcomes,they would not do this. Thus, it is necessary to keep humanity aware of risks, so that it will be possible to avoid dangers.

To conclude, this essay agrees that some  activities make nature suffer and something is too late to change ,however, there are some measures that can be taken to prevent future harm","## Task Achievement:

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People’s opinions differ as to whether businesses should put making profit high on their agenda or whether they should also shoulder social responsibilities. In my opinion, I completely agree that business owners and managers should take both concerns into consideration.

On the one hand, it seems logical that the top priority of any company is to make a profit. In order to survive in an increasingly competitive business environment, companies have to find way to cover their operation costs such as employees’ wages, building rental and utilities. In addition, corporations need to invest in research and innovations so that they can meet constantly changing demands of customers Without being profitable, any concerns about social responsibilities are just irrelevant. In other words, a business can only make contribution to society if it is in healthy financial condition.

On the other hand, I contend that the main purpose of running a business should not only be making cash. One of the social obligations business owners and executives have is to treat their employees fairly rather than to exploit them. For instance, companies should pay attention to their employees’ mental health to ensure that they are not overloaded with workload. I also advocate the idea that companies allocate a proportion of their revenues to donate to local charities or support environmental and educational projects. Finally, instead of trying to reduce costs by taking advantage of tax loopholes, corporations can contribute back to society through tax payments.

In conclusion, I concur that businesses should attach as much importance to social responsibilities as they do to financial objectives.","## Task Achievement:

Most of the urgent problems can only be solved with international cooperation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The solutions to the majority of  emergency situations can only be provided by international aid. In my opinion, international help is very crucial in dealing with most of the urgent issues.

Firstly, nowadays financial instability is at its peak. To meet the demands of life, the concept of international cooperation has gained more importance. This has become the immense need of the time, for example, via import and export of goods, various countries try to fulfil each other's needs. This help is of more significance in the developed and underdeveloped countries, where, there is a situation of feminine and starvation, hence  survival is becoming impossible for the local population.

Secondly, a lot of organizations are working hard on the international level in order to maintain peace throughout the world. Some of the countries are currently in huge conflicts. To illustrate this, to resolve such major issues, these must be addressed on the international forums to get a more suitable solution, thus avoiding the risk of wars.

Finally, when a sudden unforeseen incident happens somewhere and people end up being helpless, international help must be made available as soon as possible. To illustrate it further, the earth quacks, storms and the hurricanes etc strike the people and finances of a country harshly, hence for the sake of these people's rehabilitation, international help becomes vital.

In conclusion, I consider that some of the countries being stable are able to fulfil their public's needs, however, most of the countries are facing a lot of challenges these days. Therefore, to deal with this crisis, international cooperation is of great significance and its urgent availability must be ensured by the international organisations to maintain harmony and peace throughout the globe.","## Task Achievement:

Many countries are spending a huge amount of money on supporting their competitors to take part in some worldwide sports competitions. Others argue that it would be better if these countries can spend the money on children to take part in sports. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The issue of whether a country should spend a lot of money on these competitors has sparked off an intense debate. Some people, as advocates, suggest that huge national expenditure on supporting these competitors to take part in some worldwide sports competitions could improve the comprehensive state power. However, other as opponents claim that to spend money on children to take part in sports activities would be better than support these competitors. To a certain extent, I agree with these opponents, with some reservations. I aim at discussing both side of the issue and put up my opinion. 

On the one hand, it has well accepted that participating more sports activities could improve the health of children. However, nowadays, most of young generation locks physical excises and are reluctant to take part in sports. Accordingly, every country should implement policies to encourage and support children sports activities. For example, the government can build more sports facilities fitting for children or set up scholarship for these positive young sport participants. Consequently, when the government could spend more and more money on the children sports activities, the more benefits under the policies would address to children. 

On the other hand, spending a huge amount of money on supporting these professional competitors would encourage young children to take part in the sports. First of all, if a country has a huge expenditure on world wild professional competitions, this would directly encourage young children to be interested in sports and hope to be a professional sportman. Besides, young people would be encouraged to take part in the sports activities, when they can find that has been supported by their country. Thus, under a certain extent, I agree with these advocates to spend money on these professional sportmen, however the range of supporting should be controlled. 

To conclude, I concede that government should spend a huge amount of money on supporting children sports, when these young generation are the hope of the future. Nevertheless, I am convinced that expenditure on professional world wild sports activities are also important, and which could effectively encourage, directly or indirectly these children to participate sports.

Even if we open the app to search the study material, advertisements will come to distract in the form of other interested topics like tv shows, film clipping, musics, cartoons and games so on.

For a student no need a phone in fact. If it is very necessary to have a phone, parents can provide them basic call facility mobile phones. Once they are at home parent can keep the phone with them.

"Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to school
What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?","Youngsters find it hard to focus on or put their minds to learning. The main reason for this is that they engaged in extra curricula activities that draw away their attention from participating in school and a viable solution is to promote actions and also engage their parent can be involved and participated in learning.

A large number of kids partake in event that are not contributing to their formal education and thereby diverting their attention from learning. This is despite of the fact that they are expected to balance the actions they find themselves. In Nigeria today, it is is becoming a norm for every children to undergo vocational training. Most of this children have to report to the training center after school, They stand to face loads of assignments given to them at the end of the day.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Architecture is one of the cultural heritage that has to be protected and prevented from being damaged. In recent years, a number of citizens have been becoming become increasingly interested in discovering the history of their houses. In this essay, I will illustrate the underlying reasons for people exploring information about their houses and outline two ways in which the history of their houses can be researched. 

One primary reason is for maintaining the house. Knowing the construction and materials of buildings can help the owner in terms of maintenance. One possible approach would be to ask local residents. They might have been living in the area for ages. Moreover, they have a great deal of information. Admittedly, some messages from local residents; however, there might be the wrong information because of hazy memories. Therefore, people have to find evidence to prove the right history of those buildings.

Another reason why more people are interested in understanding their home’s past is to preserve the heritage of historic buildings. If people own a listed building which is inherited from generation to generation, they would have a responsibility to preserve it and prevent it from being damaged. In addition to the data from family, another way in which people can explore the history of houses is by doing research in the local libraries. Normally, the history of city developments is preserved in the local library. People can find a lot of data including the commencement date of the buildings, builders and historical stories.

"Some people think the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Part of the community thinks that schools are meant to create responsible citizens instead of benefitting children on an individual level specifically. I strongly agree with the thoughts and will explain them in my essay.

Schools play a vital role in any individuals growth. A child spends approximately 15 to 17 years of his or her total life in schooling. There are a plethora of roles that schools enact in children's life. Students start to learn differentiating between good and bad in their pre-teens from school which is one of the significant attributes. Hence, schools should inculcate important social thoughts rather than just keeping them focused on books and careers. For example, they should do social excursions like visiting elderly homes, helping handicapped people, lending hands to poor people for food and so on. Such activities will result in the strong character development of a child from a young age and will benefit the country and community as a whole.

Additionally, schools should not only focus on a child's level of education,  but they should also enforce socio-economic activities as part of their curriculum by creating different groups of children including all  ages. The education system should be adapted in a very dynamic way in a school. Just letting students understand the benefits of degrees and the amount of money they can earn,  will not only ruin a children's life but will also hamper the soft culture in  society. Hence making children's selfish and immature. 

Furthermore, schools should develop a free environment that allows students to put their ideas forward for doing activities that benefits society. For example, doing a small act and creating money and then donating it. Such freedom of thought will help children to think about  society at large and benefit it.

To conclude, Schools should focus on creating good citizens by adapting multiple positive thoughts and making this  a part of the education system as individual development will result positive if social thoughts in children's are fed strongly.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Information-seeking people are rising in many locations of the globe. It seems this phenomenon is caused by two staple reasons, and a number of research methods are feasible for it.

           On the one hand, people are influenced by plenty of scientific articles which are approachable in the contemporary world. This makes individuals more curious than they used to be. Thus, they are becoming interested in the history of their accommodations. Furthermore, history links people to their past. Providing that people was educated more about the history of their homes, they might have more sense of nostalgia. Sense of nostalgia originates plenty of benefits for people's mental state. Since humans are eager for these kinds of mental benefits, they have started to research concerning the history of their accommodations.

           Turning to feasible research methods of this phenomenon for the public, surveying elderly local neighbors seems as a practicable research method. Elderly people often have a decent amount of leisure time besides their knowledge regarding former residents of establishments.

"Men and women are different in terms of their characteristics and abilities. For this reason some job are better done by men and others by women.
do you agree or disagree?","It is said that people should select their career based on their gender to perform better in it, as a consequence of variations in intrinsic features of males and females. I strongly disagree with this statement and the reasons for my position are as follow.

Firstly, men and women as a human are able to do every occupation that they want. In fact, everyone of each sex could select a job and be successful in it by high attempt. For instance, some people argue that females are weak and sensitive to be the police or political character like being a president of a country, while in society can be seen that some women are in place of power in those careers and shoulder responsibilities even more than men. I think M.s Merkel, president of Germany would be a good example to reveals the strength of a woman.

Secondly, men and women complement each other. Although it is undeniable fact that each gender has the certain or unique ability, better results will be obtained in a workplace where two sexes cooperate together, due to scientific discoveries. It creates a sense of balance because they think differently and have specific methods of doing things. therefore, rather than judging these differences to be weakness, I feel that we should view them as opportunities for innovation and discovery more effective work practices.

By the way of conclusion, I believe it does not matter what is your gender, both men and women employees are an asset to any industry and as our stereotypes are not always appropriate, we must not discourage anyone to opt an occupation because of his or her gender and also a person's weakness would probably be transformed into strength by working with another sex and more endeavor.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think it is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems by increasing the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that the pressing issues of environment can be curbed by raising the price of automobiles and fuel. This essay agrees with this viewpoint as it can lead to less pollution and traffic on the roads. 

Primarily, majority of the people are concerned about the heightened problem of environment, which has become so filthy due to manhandled practices. It is often seen that in every household people are having two or three cars, which not only lead to heavy traffic on roads but also put pressure on our surroundings as these motor vehicles emit poisonous gases. For example, in north America, on an average every young member of a family has a vehicle, which leads to increased level of carbon emission. Therefore, it has been decided by certain section of people to elevate the price of auto mobiles and petrol, to regulate the environmental conditions. 

Furthermore, the government could implement the theory of demand and supply inversely, by curbing the supply of vehicles and fuel, as the level of pollution has increased globally, which is responsible for global warming. Had the supply of these products controlled at an early stage, the demand would have been automatically reduced. This has become an alarming issue now, which needs to be regulated by the authorities. 

However, there are some people who are against this trend and do not want any increase in prices as they feel it would be an unnecessary financial burden on them. For instance, many people are already bearing the numerous monthly expenses and the rising prices will give an additional monetary load. 

To conclude, although, there are people who are against this idea of soaring prices, I agree that the authorities should elevate the prices to cut down the usage and demand, otherwise, the existence on the earth would be next to impossible.","### Task Achievement:

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued by some people that entrepreneurs have to make profits and accomplish social obligations at the same time. However, I do agree that companies are responsible for the community rather than simply make reveneur. 

On the one hand, it is undeniable that businesses make money play an important role in the government. The more money they make, the more taxes they have. These taxes can be used to spend on many social activities such as building new schools, renovating public facilities or maintaining hospital's function. Another thing is that businesses which make money expand, leading to creating more jobs and larger the job market.

On the other hand, corporations should have responsibilities for society. The first thing is, businesses must not harm the environment. For example, global warming is increasing day by day due to factory emissions, which could be eliminated if they take action immediately. In addition, they are also responsible for disposing of waste by building waste treatment plants or treating exhaust fumes and waste before being discharged. Besides, profits made by companies should be put back in the community through charitable activities or financing scholarships. Taking Unilever as an example, not only improving quality of life for people around the world through its quality products and services, but also high responsibilities to the community with a lot of programmes like ""P/S protects Vietnamese smile"" which funding for children to go to school, ""OMO builds playground for kids"" brings kids in rural area have an easy access to enjoy outside activities.

Nowadays more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What do you think are the reasons for this? Do the advantage of this trend outweigh the disadvantage?,"Having children tend to be less popular in our generation now, many people decide to have children later in their life, and many of them don't even want to have kids. There are some reasons behind it, and they will be explained in the following paragraphs.

First, the parenting costs are high. In the past, parents didn't have to spend too much time and pay too much attention to their children. However, due to the development of our society, parents want to give their kids the best life. Therefore, cultivating kids can be extremely expensive. Take China as an example. Chinese parents always pay considerably high parenting costs for kids' education, such as tutorials and home teachers. Hence, the parenting costs can be substantially high and exhausting because parents consistently need to keep an eye on their children. 

Second, the matured welfare system. In the past, especially during wartime, human resources were precious; therefore, the government encouraged its people to have more kids. On the contrary, human resources are not essential now, and we don't really need our offspring to take care of our elder lives; the government can serve us well. Besides, on account of our developed medical condition, we can live quite a long time; thus, the fertility rate is bound to decrease. 

Third, women's social status has been promoted. Modern women have a high level of education, they know the risk of having kids on their bodies and careers. Hence, they have the right to decide when they give birth.

People nowadays tend to have children in older ages. do the advantages of this oyutweigh the disadvantages?,"In this fast-paced life, people prefer to have children later in their life. It has been argued by many whether this is a positive step or not. I, personally think it has more demerits as it increases stress and anxiety and also leads to many health problems. This essay will discuss both  sides and further state a strong reason why the negatives outweigh the positives.

On one hand, Due to excessive competition in the corporate sector, women tend to conceive later in their life. This could be because it brings financial stability and maturity to handle a baby with care. For example, a survey in the London time shows a considerable amount of females prefer to give birth when they are in their thirties. Therefore, it helps them to enjoy themselves before bringing a big responsibility to the world.

On the other hand, with the positives, one cannot neglect the negatives it offers. The first and foremost is the stress a lady has to go through when they have babies late. In other words, females tend to become weak after the age of thirty and suffer from different kinds of anxieties. For instance, in the United Kingdom, 90% of women suffer from psychological issues if they conceive after the required age. This further leads to many health problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

In conclusion, it is inevitable to say there is no appropriate time to bring a soul into this world, but bringing them at a stake of hampering your health would be a wrong decision to make. I, strongly recommend the disadvantages overweigh the advantages as it could be harmful to the lady. Moreover, doctors are in favour of conceiving at the right age.","## Task Achievement:

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"With the development of technology and techniques, more and more different goods are introduced for consumers. While the phenomenon gives rise to a variety of pollution, there are also some methods that we can use to solve problems.

In order to face the increasing number of productions, thousands of factories are established to enhance production and promote revenue. Most of those take advantage of fossil fuels to generate power for the use of production. Nevertheless, it would contribute to an amount of toxic air pollution and discharge sewage. More specifically, the factories not only pose a threat to people’s physical health but also contaminate the quality of air. Therefore, despite the fact that more factories can improve production efficiency, it influences our environment and deteriorates air quality.

While a variety of problems are caused by production, there are some solutions that can alleviate the condition. On the part of the government, they can enact some legal regulations for the purpose of managing the performance of factories’ production processes. In other words, strict rules can pose a standard for merchants to follow up, and choose renewable material in the production process. As far as the customers are concerned, they can spontaneously choose goods that are produced by eco-friendly materials and boycott the commodities that are produced by hazardous materials. Accordingly, if there is more consumption of those goods, merchants will gradually increase the amount of environmental raw materials.

Employers should give their staff at least a 4-week holiday a year to make employees better at their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree to this statement?,"Holidays are deemed  necessary for the employee to rest so they can perform better. The length of days off may vary, but many believe that company should give their workers a minimum of a month per year. I believe that this is important to prevent burnout and improve overall health so they can do their assigned task well.

To begin with, holidays are vital for everyone, including workers. The company should allow their workers to leave the office for up to months per year to prevent burnout. Burnout which commonly occurs in workers, especially in a high-pressure environment, may predispose to bad decision-making and a decline in work performance. Moreover, staff may opt to leave the company that treats them badly by forcing them to work without sufficient days off. For instance, many young workers are resigned from their job in a startup company due to stress in the high-pressure environment. Hence, it is important for  business owners to give their employers several days off to take a good rest and maintain their mental well-being so they can perform well in their jobs.

Secondly, vacations are necessary to maintain the staff's general health. Overworked and tired workers may lead to a decline in work performance and decision-making. Proper sleep and rest are vital in maintaining good health to perform daily tasks. For example, a tired doctor on 24 hours shift may make mistakes in assessing and treating their patients that may lead to malpractice. Therefore, it is important for a company to allow their staff to take time off the office so they can rest peacefully and fully recharge their stamina in order to perform their responsibilities.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In these modern times, individuals are able to find out more about their surroundings. Knowing more about one’s home is also an interesting topic. This essay will outline possible reasons for this situation and explain how may citizens achieve the information they seek for. 

To begin with, there might be two main answers to this interest in the history of buildings. Firstly, the ageing process may add more value to a building, so folk can feel more special about their houses. For example, there are many videos about historical buildings on Youtube, which is an online streaming platform, and these videos are highly on demand. Secondly, because of overpopulation, available housing is quite hard to find, so prices are rising almost daily. Because of this, old buildings are becoming popular too. For instance, in some urban cities, authorities are now giving permission to reconstruct these buildings, and also giving funds. So, more citizens want to know about their buildings, in order to achieve these opportunities. 

It can be said that there are various ways to find out more about the history of a house. First of all, one can easily achieve many resources on the internet. Local administration websites, for example, can be a good start for searching. Also, most town councils are now able to give a city plan, and sometimes they may provide old records to local inhabitants too. Before the internet, these records were the only formal papers, and now they contain a part of our history.

To conclude, interest in history is rising day by day, especially when it comes to our buildings. Being able to add value to our living quarters is one reason, but also overpopulation matters too. One can use the internet or ask town councils, in order to find more information about this delicate subject.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to ensure public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy. 

Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, hence decreasing public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very hard to implement. To achieve this target, the officials could impose a levy on unhealthy foods, or reduce their availability on the market. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be deemed as curtailing customers’ freedom.

Personal freedom is seen as an extremely important human right. Therefore, many people think that only they should decide what food and drink they consume, and that it is wrong for governments to interfere with their personal choices. Doing so can indeed lead to public discontent. Alternatively, a better approach would be to launch awareness-raising campaigns about a healthy diet so that people would be able to make better-informed dietary decisions themselves.

All in all, authorities can exercise power to limit the selection of foods people have access to, but that would not be without consequences. Instead, governments should invest in education programs to educate people how they can improve their health simply through making wiser decisions about what they eat.","## Task Achievement:
- The essay adequately addresses the given task by discussing both views on the topic of government regulation of nutritious food and providing the writer's opinion.

4)	Some people think that it is a good idea to give children a small amount of money each week to spend on what they would like. Other people think that this is wrong and that it is a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is irrefutable that it is important to teach our children money management early in their lives .Although, many may consider it a positive phenomenon, it is not a trend without drawbacks. We will discuss both sides of the coin before a reasonable conclusion is withdrawn.

Firstly, we will discuss positive aspect of this trend. To commence with, parents think it is a good habit to give children a small amount of money on regular basis. They will understand value for money and turn into more responsible citizens . Moreover, they would also been exposed to situations where they have to save fortnight’s money to buy something essential. For example, if they want to buy new version of video games, they should save from their pocket money and spend that money to buy the desire product.
On the flipside, the penny allotted at such small age could deteriorate their life . Chances of involving into wrong doings are on higher side with other friends. So, until child gets matured and understand the ins and outs of life, even a single penny can drift him away from his academic paths. Instead, they should be given money to participate in co curricular activities or other sports and events.
To conclude,  parents play an important role in children’s life. Parents should keep a strict watch where their children are spending their pocket money. After analysing both the aspects, I am of the opinion that children should be given little amount of money occasionally. They should learn how to save and use hard earned money. It is important to teach them financial management in early years of their life.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think that competitive sports have a positive effect on the education of teenagers while others argue that the effect is negative.


Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","There is a belief that competition in sports have benefits on young people's education whilst other opinions state there might be downsides. There is no doubt  over-competitiveness may cause several issues for teenagers but it also enhances their ambition and resilience towards the world.

On one hand, there are those who agree on how powerful the effects of sport are in our daily perspective, as truly helps to perceive more self-security, strength, and willpower. That means, teenagers will be capable to develop an instinct that enables them to face this challenging world we now live in. Additionally, this “competitive mindset” encourages them to improve and pushes them forward.

On the other hand, if this sense of competence is misunderstood in an unhealthy way, which basically means having a feeling of overpressure, troubles might appear. If they end up believing these games are a battle for power rather than a funny experience, the line has been crossed. Aggressivity has a big role to play and it is definitely the boundary when conflict and arguments arise. 

I personally believe that, if competitive sports are well-focused and planned, they should not be a big deal. I think before or after each training a speech should be given in order to prevent conflicts between them. Competitive and respect values that ensure peace and companionship are, without any doubt, essential lessons. 

To conclude, competitive sports could be either potentially useful or violent, the point is how we teach teenagers to practice them, and which principles are linked to it. It is probably true that, providing them an appropriate instruction, benefits could outweigh downsides.","## Task Achievement:

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion ?","The Basic aim of schools is to make children into good citizens and workers in few public point of view, relatively, advantageous for them as individuals.This essay disagrees, that institutions only provide benefits to society in terms of producing good citizens and workers.Firstly, this essay will discuss about the self grooming, a sense of responsibility and pressure handling and secondly, it will be followed by the hard working, self confidence, difference between goods and bads and improvised communications.

The Education plays a vital role in the development of the person's personality.It has been groomed the child's from the very beginning when they started their education.With the passage of time it would be helpful to make them sensible enough.So that, they can easily handle every possible pressure they can ever meet them in their upcoming life's.In addition, they will also learn their responsibilities in order to add positive attributes in society.For instance, a survey report published by CNN, in 2014, stated that educated people have been more successful and more self confident.

Moreover, learning new things can bring up the new challenges on the daily basis, which will lead them to do hard work all the time.They will start to believe themselves, that, they walk through every difficult phase of life with ease.It will force them to have faith in them.A good person is one who always have the control to his bad thoughts and always try to be good with others this thing has been taught in every institute at the start.Nowadays, communication is very important better education can provide the individuals with outstanding skills which can lead them to the success.For example, Oxford university had performed the survey in 2016, which shows that 90 percent of individuals believed that, they can solve any problem.

Human activities have negative effects on plants and animals species. Some people think that is too late to do anything about effective measures can taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinions.,"In recent years, people’s activities have posed a serious threat to the environment, some individuals argue that it would be a hardship to improve the environmental issue since we missed the good opportunity. However, there is some uncertainty of whether we should make efforts on this issue.In this essay, I will review both sides of the debate to seek a conclusion.

To begin with, there is no doubt that the economic society we face today is becoming more prominent, and more environmental problems have risen up and begun to affect our lives such as deforestation ,over-haunting, atmospheric  and water pollution, which causes trees and flowers to disappear, and a significant number of animals homeless and even died. Most precious specious are dying out such as panda, so it is evident that some destroyed behaviour has an irreversible effect on the environment. Although some laws and regulations have been taken by the government, it is somewhat late to an extent.Since we are not capable to reproduce some extinct biologies in a natural way. 

At the same time ,however, individuals have realized the importance of building an environmentally friendly society, there are still a considerable number of plants and animals that need to be protected and being protected. In addition, efforts have been taken by authorities and individuals should be encouraged in the long run, as the next generation could be benefit from our perseverance efforts. Consequently, it is a possibility to create a positive cycle for our society and human being.

To summarize, it is noticeable that human activity has a disadvantaged impact on the ecosystem, it seems we focus on the issue not promptly even though we start to tackle this trouble. On the other hand, it is has been observed that our ecosystem has improved in all aspects due to the fact that all people’s contributions. In the final analysis, one can conclude that taking tangible action in protecting the environment should be proposed at any time and we should look forward to the future and have a positive view to  handle it.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that the problem of pollution has a huge impact not only on the environment but on humanity health as well. And the question of whether to raise up the value on cars fuel or not is extremely topical today. I tend to feel that it is a quite reasonable idea and i will give some reasons for it.

To start with the price changes, we have a big probability percentage that people will put up with this and it wil not work, but on the other hand if the government suggests environmentally friendly kinds of transportation or other alternatives such as comfortable public transport, more bike paths around the city and not only on the downtown area. Another great example of replacement fuel vehicle is electro cars. But it is quite clear that such cars need special charging stations, which are rare in small cities all the more so in the countryside.

Furthermore, I believe that the biggest influence on  ecology have manufacturing companies. It is well known that the effects of their exhaust emissions are much bigger than traffic fumes. Finally, we should remember that bigger factories with  great capital should be held responsible for the consequences but not the common people.

To conclude, I do understand the opposing view, which is that gas should not be pricey because it is no surprise that society got used to it. Nevertheless, I suggest that the pushy method is the quickest and easiest way to preserve our planet. Notably, though, I think that it needs to be a gradual process, based on careful support rather than sudden demanding law by the strict government.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people say that the increasing business and cultural contact between countries is positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both views and give your opinion","In this day and age, it is universal truth that commercial and cutural interaction has an inseperable relationship with the growth of any aspects of each country. However, whether developing it has always been a topic of general public. While a number of people argue that promoting communication between these regions may carry some  potential dangers for identity, others have a contrary-minded that it will significantly create superb results in world's connection. Personally, I contend that the benefits that globalization brings about outweighs the drawbacks.

On the one hand, it is understandable that why some groups of community believe that the interconnection between countries will take a heavy toll on the national recognition. The key rationale is that as foreign influences, especially the Western cultures that permeate other societies, more people will embrace intriguingly external ideas and start to consider that their conventional custom as obsolete, which may probably result in a loss of the national true values. However, this thinking is totally exaggerated. As far as I am concerned, instead of marginalizing the traditional values of every country, the globalization has given a larger range of chance for citizens all over the world to introduce and open their own culture to other friends. Korea perfectly exemplifies this situation. The widespread presence of entertainment companies and TV programmes, specifically the ""Hallyu wave"", has been the key to foster and promote a global appreciation towards this country. This is a testament to positive impacts of world's contact on a country's values.

On the other hand, I am of the opinion that the global development will offer stupendous advantages. In terms of business, many entrepreneurs can expand the foreign markets. As a result, many jobs are created which will directly improve people's living standards. To give a clear example, the contribution of SamSung in VietNam has hostically addressed the unemployment of a plethora of people. In addition to this, in terms of culture, the integration among these areas will mitigate many social problems which occurs on a regualr basis. To exemplify, the thinking of Western's community will gradually turn the gender inequality sentiments on Asia society's head. Therefore, it seems sensible that we can broaden our mind towards a harmonized development. 

In conclusion, while the exchange in tradition as well as trading still exist some disadvantages, it is irrefutable that the global changing has created many significant benefits for each and everyone. It is also clear that the traditional values can be separately maintained in tandem with the global integration.","## Task Achievement:

Discuss both views and give your opinion,"One of the primary passing time activities for children is watching TV. Yet, a rising argument revolving around how TV contribute to a child's behaviour is going viral. Some people believe that the content is the main factor affecting how children act. Meanwhile, others find that the hours spent on TV are more likely to influence how they behave. Accordingly, this essay will discuss both views and then I will provide my opinion. 

On the one hand, many individuals say that focusing on what children watch is highly significant. In other words, they argue that tv shows, cartoons or movies affect how the child behave in terms of speaking, manners and actions. For example, many little ones act violently when they watch action cartoons. Additionally, young girls sometimes would act like princesses, fairies, and pet animals depending on what they watch. By considering these instances, they aid this side of the argument significantly. 

On the other hand, there are those who are concerned with the watching duration limits for children. The more a lad spends time on TV the higher possibility his behaviour will change. Many parents stated that when their offspring watch television more than usual, they tend to get absent-minded, violent and restless. For instance, a little boy's condition was diagnosed of slow cognitive processing caused by staying overtime watching kids' shows and the lack of staying active with his family. 

Personally speaking, I believe that both views are valid and certainly contribute to children's behaviour. However, the former could influence the child positively if parents restricted specific content such as, educational and musical shows which can establish the creativity and learning abilities in children. On the contrary, the latter's effect appears disadvantageous to the young ones isolating them from social and domestic interactions.

In conclusion, children's constant exposure to TV definitely affects their behaviour. However, parents can determine the duration limit and type of shows their kids watch and, thus, avoid the negative impacts on their little ones.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that robots are important for human's Future development. Other think that robots have negative effects on society discuts both views and give your opinion.,"In Contemporary esa artificial intelligence growing at an alarming pace and helps  nations to come out of disaster situations. Few people believe that the development of robots is very substantial for human allover growth. However other claims that robots brought into the industry put bad effects on humans in numerous ways. As far as I am concerned I believe that machines are important to some limit otherwise, they can be spoiled situations. In this essay, I will discuss both views and I will try to give my own opinion.

To Commence with the first view that how easily artificial intelligence can provide help in gruesome conditions. To elaborate on this, it can work more efficiently in some conditions where folks can never indulge such as to tackle infection or work in extreme weather conditions. For example, during the Covid-19 period, several countries throughout the world used machines to fight infections and ultimately it provided significant results in the favour of humans and helped them to come out of these hazardous situations. Consequently, it always can prove very effective in dangerous areas.

Shifting toward the Second view, according to the folks who believe (AI) Artificial Intelligence is a big blow to human availability. It already has begun to occupy places of the public in industrial areas. In other words, massive companies or firms have started to use automatic equipment over the places of humans in order to produce large stocks of consumable things. To cite an example, In manifold developed nations have brought machines in use to accomplish the task before deadlines and try to avoid workforce. As a result, the majority of the workforce across the world becomes unemployed due to advanced machinery.

In conclusion, I believe advancement such as robotism is very imperative to fight such  problems like extreme drought as well as huge flooding or erosion of land where it is difficult for labour to work otherwise the use of automatic operators should be limited by law yet it can help to save the community placements on the workplaces.","## Task Achievement:

"most people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. why? do the advantages of this outweigh its disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples,e.g from your knowledge or experience","In the present age, people tend to have children at an older age. From my perspective, it has more drawbacks than benefits. This essay will discuss the main reasons associated with this epidemic and reveals why it has more disadvantages.

The main reasons for this global problem are people's career and their freedom. Nowadays, individuals' career and their position in society have great importance. Everyone tries to enhance their performance and get promoted; therefore, having a baby is a huge obstacle and prevents parents from reaching their goals. What's more, people without children have freedom. In other words, they do whatever they want and enjoy their lives. For example, a single person can travel or go to parties anytime without worrying about her baby.

However, having children at an older age has significant drawbacks. First of all, old parents' offspring may suffer some disorders like Down syndrome. This problem is more common among old mothers' children, which causes irreparable problems in society. Secondly, older parents are not energetic, and they can't play with their babies properly. They get bored easily, and in the future, because of a huge age difference, they can't understand children, and this causes a disparity between them. For instance, teens with young parents have a good relationship with them.

To conclude, having a baby in old age has various reasons, like the importance of job prospects and liberty. On the other hand, it has serious demerits like disability and parents' impatient. I personally believe that the benefits of this epidemic cannot overshadow the disadvantages.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others think that this has little effects and measures are required. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"People hold different views about whether an increasing number of sports facilities come in handy to improve public health or this method is not very effective and it requires measures. From my standpoint, the better the sports conveniences where, the better the public health there. 
    It has been proven that people can improve health of themselves without sports facilities. For instance, they can be much healthier if they avoid eating too much junk food. If he or she is inclined to eat meals that are  rich in vitamins or go to the doctor's on a regular basis with the aim of increasing his or her condition, they definitely manage to do it irrespective of what sport facilities created by governments. Additionally, some inhabitants may be incapable of making a full use of the conveniences since they are not able to afford to them. In that case, despite what conditions, authorities create in order to ameliorate the health of people, they turn out to be less efficient. 
   However, no sooner do authorities constitute sports facilities, then they will reap benefits from them. Above all, inhabitants provided with enough conditions to do sports activities can improve their fitness. Clearly indicating, locals, especially youngsters who are dynamic and energetic are not enabled to join in sports centres if special conveniences are not available in the area where they live in, as a result, they become deprived of making profits from conveniences supplied. Thus, a lack of opportunities may appear as an obstacle to have a healthy lifestyle. A wide range of sports clubs urges people to go to there and people become prone to do exercise as well as living in a healthy way of life.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Nowadays, the number of people interested in finding out about the history of their building increased rapidly. In my opinion, people trying to find strange things about their houses and also can help them to find a sense of identity. I am also convinced that an individual can earn a sizeable amount of information by asking and researching.

From a social viewpoint, people are curious about their house’s history because when people have a broad spectrum of knowledge about where they live, such as their home or area, this matter can lead them to feel safe and also they can find a sense of identity. Moreover, people have a peaceful lifestyle these days. Thus, they are looking for strange things. In other words, people search their house’s history to find strange things such as murders and robberies or a crime. In my view, people would change their lifestyle to a hectic lifestyle.

Also, there is a special sector in the libraries people can find more information about earlier events that happened and their dates and location.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is argued whether higher educational qualification makes a person more successful or one's more engagement in paid work straight after school is more beneficial. I am going to examine this question from both viewpoints alongside providing my opinion.

On the one hand, the option to start work after school is more attractive, because people can start earning money. In this way, they can become financially independent and support their family as well. This may also help them to acquire skills about how to manage expenses or budget, which they can implement further in their life or business. One good illustration of this is a successful businessman named Ratan Tata, the owner of Ambuja Cement Company, who chose to work just after school education and became one of the richest persons in the world by applying his knowledge, skills and real-life experiences to the business. Thus, this example vividly demonstrates that getting higher degrees is  not necessarily needed for a successful career.

On the other hand, few individuals have the opposite opinion because  they may believe that attaining academic qualifications offers better options. There are some professions that cannot be joined without a relevant degree such as doctor, engineer, lawyer, and many more, as all these occupations demand academic qualification with intense training and practice, but also offer lucrative salary packages and more financial stability. Moreover, people can  easily switch their careers at any point in their life. When they feel monotonous after working in one field for a long time, they can enter in new jobs as compared to those, who dropped the idea of attending university or college.

In conclusion, it seems to me that for having successful career, one may not need any academic qualification, as it is just a piece of paper  that cannot decide someone's future.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this ?

How can people research this ?","People usually ask different questions and do certain prior studies when they move into a new area to live. Recently, in some countries, it is becoming a norm to ask about the history of the house you just moved on or you are planning to move into. Here, In this essay, I will give the reasons which motivate people to seek such information and how they can find it. 

In comparison to other areas, naturally or due to some man-made problems certain places can be more susceptible to flooding, wind storm, air pollution or earthquake. For instance, due to their proximity to industrial zones, some areas are more prone to air pollution. And in order to avoid these natural and man-made disasters people usually want to do background research about an area for its previous experiences. As a case in point, the Japanese town Shinwa has seen 10 earth-quake of varying scale in the past 4 years. As a result, many people have relocated to other areas. So, to know about such information people might be interested to look at the history of the areas they want to live in.

On the other hand, the most useful way to investigate the past of the building is by using the Internet. It provides humans with a huge number of information, all the featured events that happened in a reconciliation might be recorded. However, if the private apartment is located in the suburbs, asking the local residents would be the better choice. They have lived there for a long time so their knowledge about the neighbours is impressive. For instance, a man who believed the advertising by telesales decided to buy a residence in the suburbs. Luckily, he has come directly to the place and the local residents told him a story about the whole family being murdered in that house; therefore, he could dodge the house containing bad luck.

To sum up, To find out about the future developments of their area and to avoid natural and man-made disasters people might like to study the history of the area they live.

Parents should encourage children to spend less time on studying and more time on doing physical activities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Being a parent is an extremely complex task as anyone would agree, a lot of crucial factor goes into consideration, and the choices a parent makes to nurture his kid ultimately defines the person they would become while growing up, attention to detail is a must and a parent should consider all the aspects of a child's growth and not just stick to either.

I moderately agree with the claim as encouraging children to spend less time studying and more on doing physical activities is not only a good recreational break for a child, but rather a physical development aid as most of our body evolution takes place during childhood, and transformations can be phenomenal.

Studies suggest that children who perform more physical activities have more brain advancement than children who don't perform any type of sports. According to science, any sport / exercise pumps more oxygen into the blood and triggers a neurochemical response in our brain for tolerance and growth.

in conclusion, it's not only a balancing act for a kid between mental and physical activities but a major overall spike in functioning and progress.","## Task Achievement:

"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people store knowledge on the internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","With rapid development of technology, people nowadays using the internet in various way. This essay will discuss factors contributing to this trend about store knowledge in the internet rather than books and why I think it is a good thing.

There are several reasons I suggest to store knowledge online brings many benefits. Firstly,people may solve their problem conveniently and immidiately by just searching the internet. It even being a common phrase that ""If you have question, just google it"", the only thing what people need to do, is snap their question on mobile application or laptop then they can find the answer easily.

Secondly,  it made a good method to develope education system in rural area or the third countries. Many years ago children may need buy expensive books for their studies in schools, but nowadays as this copies of lesson's materials are storaged on crowd, enhencing young communities who live in an inconvinient enviroment to get knowledge in a easiler , cheaper way.

On the other hand, there are disadvantages if people store knowledge on internet, as much as information released online even what things actually are wrong, people may believe this wrong information easily if they are lack of avidence to support the truth. Therefore people suggested the government should build up a group to identify these information are true or wrong when those spreaded online.

As discussed aboved, nowadays people can grab the knowledge from internet so easily, it caused by new edge technology,x Although it may bring people to know something acutally not true, but peosonally I think it is controlable so I belive it is a good trend.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In recent years, many celebrities are famous because of the glamour and wealth rather than for their accomplishments. While I strongly agree with this statement because of a negative example for teenagers such as influence on children’s life and highly financed usage. Some celebrities' skills might be average even though they are rich and become young people’s idols.

Firstly, influence on the children’s life in the social media platform. This is because famous people such like actors, actresses, singers, models or sports stars take their picture and video, put it on IG, Facebook and Twitter  regularly, to create more fans. A good example would be Justin Biber, who is rich and famous in the world. Everyday he posts where he goes, sometimes he attends parties, pubs or clubs and he has many tattoos on his body. This message to young people is that they want to be the same as their idol, and many young people get a tattoo on their skin and become bad behavior.

	Secondly, highly financial usage is another reason why it is not good for teenagers. The famous people promote many branded accessories for their job, so children want to buy or use and force their parents to buy high quality branded things. For example, HERA Company hired Jenny, who is a very famous Kpop group (BlackPink) member to advertise their latest makeup collection. She is pretty, slim, and smooth skin. And she takes makeup tutorials to use every brush or every shade and lipstick, young people think that is the only way one can look beautiful. The kind of highly paid celebrities have the ability to pay to get what they need, therefore young children are not similar to famous people. 

	Despite the possibility of children developing their talents, there are far more negative examples for the younger generation. I extremely agree to this because of the influence on the young people's life and top level financial usage.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.,"Rise in population, has led to an increase in the usage of vehicles that has resulted in many environmental problems. There are numerous people who think that the price of the fuel must increase. In my opinion, I completely agree with the idea that costly fuel will help solve various environmental issues. 

Firstly, the excessive use of natural resources used to manufacture a vehicle, causes countless environmental problems like deforestation, killing of animal for leather which results in irregular rainfall. However, the spike in fuel cost makes many people think twice before purchasing a vehicle. 

Secondly, the gas emitted from the vehicle cause various air pollutants to harm the environment and living beings. For instance, global warming, soil erosion that deteriorates the plants. Therefore, by enforcing strict laws like increasing the cost of fuel will make people opt for public transport, which will help reduce the usage of vehicles.

Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The advertising industry has undeniably thrived in recent decades, infiltrating many aspects of daily life including preferences. From my perspective, I consider this growth to be completely negative as it leads to a distorted perception of reality and overconsumption among consumers.

My foremost concern lies in the tendency of advertisements to cause audiences to falsely perceive the relative importance of major factors in their lives. They generally prioritise material possessions and physical appearance while failing to appreciate the value of other positive qualities. A prime example is advertising campaigns run by cosmetics brands which often praise physical attractiveness as being vital to a healthy relationship, although reliability and sympathy have been long proven by experts to be more influential in fostering personal connections. This well-established truth would likely be more popularly embraced if marketing messages did not exaggerate the significance of physical appearance.

The consumerism caused by excessive advertising is another reason for my disapproval of its popularity. Marketers nowadays are armed with new customer insights and advanced technical tools to skillfully entice viewers into making impulsive purchases. To illustrate, TikTok has developed a detection feature that can constantly identify the preferences and hobbies of users based on their content search, subsequently prompting suitable buying suggestions that accurately trigger their temptation to buy these things. This has given rise to impulsive buying that consequently leads to not only personal debt but also excessive waste which contaminates the environment since more unwanted obsolete items would be discarded. It is a testament as to why advertising campaigns are detrimental at both individual and societal levels.

In conclusion, the prevalence of advertisements appears to me as a disadvantage as they distort the audience’s view of life and breed overconsumption. That is why governments should issue more stringent laws to restrain the development of the advertising industry until the aforementioned issues are comprehensively addressed.","## Task Achievement:

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Few topics have drawn as much scholarly attention as the importance of teaching cooperation to school children through participation in team sports activities in the school. Although there has been substantial debate on whether this is the best way to inculcate the habit in children or not, I am of the opinion that former proposition has several strong elements that deserve attention. 

A number of benefits can be attributed to educating children about cooperation through organizing joint games in educational institutes. On the one hand, having team sports will definitely lead to small disharmony and arguments among the player which if not resolved will result in the defeat of the team. For example, if the team members are not bonded through team spirit, defenders may pass the ball to the wrong member which in turn, may result in the opposite team gaining an advantage over the other team. This will teach the kids to cooperate in future matches to avoid the repetition of the same tale. On the other hand, without team spirit, children are only likely to lack behind in terms of unleashing their full potential.

Admittedly, it is true that joint competition is the best way to teach cooperation but one must not ignore that there are also other ways for children to learn teamwork other than team sports like allocating joint tasks like cleaning, indulging in group games like puzzles. However, the benefits of these other methods seem to be insignificant against the deluge of benefits associated with team games.

In conclusion, I would not wish to underestimate the concerns regarding the emphasis on team games rather than other methods of cooperation. Nevertheless, I feel that team games will have a far-reaching impact on the cooperation level, not only in childhood but also in adulthood.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people have different views about looking for a future career. While some argue that getting a job after finishing high school is the best choice I believe that studying a higher education level is the better option. 
On the one hand, there are several reasons to support the idea of starting up a career right off the bat after school. The first one is that the young generation are able to earn a living  by themselves they are independent about finance, even they could support money for family at early stage. The second reason is that it is common knowledge that working at early age instead of studying higher education enables people to gain more experiences. This might be due to the fact that after a long time working with different jobs, youngsters would receive a host of lessons about life, therefore, it would beneficial for them if they want to have their own professional career in the future. 
Despite the above arguments, I maintain that higher education is a integral factor with regards to personal successful career in the future. Firstly, the choice of studying at University and College enables people to have a basic knowledge for the life ahead of them. People would gain a variety of good things to broaden their horizons by the lectures from school. Beside, they also have opportunities to build a relationship with open-minded people such as friends and professor, or learn a lot a lessons about your life from experts. Moreover, we are living in globalized world, higher education plays a vital role to help the youngsters to have a rewarding job.

Some people think news has no connection to people’s lives. So then it is a waste of time to read the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There are some people assume that it is time-consuming to read newspapers or watch news programs whose information is thought to be irrelevant to people's lives. From my personal perspective, I absolutely disagree with the aforementioned belief. 
    On the one hand, there are some explanations for why people refuse to obtain the news. The most popular one is that the information from the news seems unrelated to their lives.  For them, most reports on international emergencies and events that they read about are pointless as they are happening outside of their local community. For example,  it is obvious that we cannot recognize any relationship between a worker's life and a report about the status of the war in the Middle East or the change political system of a country in the all the side of the world. 
    On the other hand, staying up-to-date with the news brings humans colossal benefits in comparison with those who do not pay much attention to it. First and foremost, with every category or article that is read or watched, one can acquire knowledge about events taking place across the world. They could accumulate not only a lot of solutions for tackling many issues which are often indicated in newspapers or programs on TV, but also knowledge about the urgent phenomenon to share with their friends or relatives to strengthen the bonds among them.  Frequently reading news reports articles, regardless of the media used is a newspaper or a television program, citizens can comprehensibly understand the latest movement of the country, especially those about economic , thus can turn them into their advantage. For instance, in a recent interview with Peter Linkonas - a permanent real estate trader, he said that his  decision to invest in Western market, which significantly contributed to his success, came out while he was reading an economic report on The Wall Street Journal.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","People have different views about whether youngsters should straightly get a job after leaving school or go to university or college to continue learning. Both two groups have their own reasons, but personally, I am inclined toward the latter opinion. 

There are a number of reasons why some believe that the young had better search for jobs right after school. Firstly, in today’s world, there is a large number of students who choose the wrong majors for studying, leading to wasting their time and a lot of money. Secondly, in some conception, going to work early is an opportunity for the young to experience reality sooner. For example, that young people get a job at the age of 18 means they likely have a chance to be successful earlier than their friends who participate in higher education. 

On the other hand, I would argue that it is much more beneficial for youngsters to continue their learning journey at universities or colleges. The first reason is that if we have a chance to study in a professional educational institution, we will acquire not only essential knowledge about our field but also priceless lessons and experiences from our lecturers. This is so amazing because this can help the young to save a huge amount of time figuring it out themselves and make their career paths more secure. In addition, universities or colleges are extremely good environments for young people to meet and get closer to peers and professors, which translates to some soft skills development such as communication, presentation, and teamwork skills, for instance. These are all vital factors contributing to a successful career. 

In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for the young to join the labour market early, I strongly stick to my opinion that youngsters should go to universities or colleges for a better educational background.","## Task Achievement:

Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"There is a tremendously controversial perspective heating up a debate over the ubiquity of commercials in daily life. This phenomenon has both pros and cons, however, its merits may outweigh its counterpart. 

 

Without a shadow of a doubt, the widespread presence of advertising can bring about a wealth of advantages for people, especially the customers. In this day and age, advertisements which are used to provide potential purchasers with detailed product information on a mass scale are essential in helping the customers have the right consciousness of new offerings. Therefore, they will have appropriate shopping selections according to their preferences. For example, Omachi noodles which is one of the most well-known labels have promoted their brand via a short video on television with a view to introducing the fresh quality of the noodles at an affordable price for the majority of buyers. Hence, there are a bunch of benefits when an ever-increasing number of advertisements is more and more popular in everyday life. 

 

While the redeeming features of the increasing popularity of advertising are widely acknowledged, its downsides still lingers. One of them is that substantial enterprises utilize exaggerated and false claims, which are made in advertisements. Thus, an eclectic mix of clients have a tendency to afford products that are impractical and unnecessary. For instance, the UK’s advertising Standards Authority has banned advertisements for L’Oreal skin cream on the grounds that they make excessive use of photo-editing technology to misrepresent beauty benefits. Thereupon, there are a few disadvantages that prove the ubiquitous advertising a negative development.

 

To sum up, the prevalence of advertisements creates both benefits and drawbacks for humans. Notwithstanding, I regard the predominance of advertisements still brings more boons for society.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people believe that it is no need for the manager to care about their worker’s clothes because the most important things are their work quality. I think that it depends on the type of job.

On the one hand, there are so many companies have not required their worker to have a dress code anymore. First, not all jobs need employees to wear a uniform or formal clothes. For example, the designer often works with computers so they do not need to dress up beautiful, they can work with casual clothes which help them more comfortable and get a high quality of work. Second, Apple and Facebook are two incredible companies, and both are not requiring their employees to wear a uniform. The purpose is to create an amazing work environment, a fun, creative place to enhance the quality of their staff’s production.

On the other hand, there are some occupations that workers must wear in a formal way.

There are jobs that if employees do not care about their dress, their work quality will go down. For example, it is necessary for the doctor to wear their special clothes which can antimicrobial while operating for the patient. In some cases, the worker’s clothes can show their politeness and respect to their customers. For instance, receptionists always have to dress in an elegant way to create a great impression to the guests.

Some people find advertisements amusing or annoying and they are not influenced by this when they shop. To what extend do you agree or disagree.,"The purpose of advertisement is to persuade consumers to buy a product so they make the advertising appealing and also increase the rate of appearing in public. However, this can be irritating to some people and according to them, it brings backfire effects. In my point of view, I believe that advertising does have some influence on shoppers’ behavior but to claim that this is a major or minor influence, individuals’ perspectives and situations should be taken into account. 

To begin with, a piece of advertising can be delivered to customers in many ways, and as the frequency of being seen by people increases, the greater the effect it has. This is called brand recognition. This is a conventional strategy that has been successfully applied throughout history. For instance, old brands namely Adidas and Nike that have been on the market for a long time are familiar to consumers since they passively see the logos of these brands daily. As a result, when it comes to buying shoes and sneakers, Nike and Adidas are their first choices. Moreover, in the modern world, since e-commerce platforms are growing rapidly leading to customers not experiencing the quality of products in person, online advertising has a tremendous benefit as it tells the buyers the product’s pros, and usages. 

In contrast, the decision to purchase a product consists of many factors other than appealing advertising. A wise buyer would buy a product based on its price with respect to the quality it gives. Therefore, advertising with slight exaggeration could not affect one’s act of buying or not. Moreover, advertising that appears in some situations could create inconvenience for customers. A good example of this is YouTube ads. These ads interrupt in between the videos which reduce the enjoyment of users. Therefore, people would have negative attitudes towards the products being advertised.

To conclude, advertising is a familiar concept to anyone. A piece of advertising could enhance products’ sales but also could be irritating; therefore, the potential of it maximizing or not depends on how it is delivered to buyers.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","Behind people's curiosity of knowing the history of the house they live in is a back story, and sometimes it is a horror story. The reasons for this curiosity are widely ranged, but I will try to share my experience with this phenomenon.

First, the curiosity sometimes grows from a random horror storyteller who shares their haunted house story on a particular platform, Twitter for instance. Then, as a reader who is so into the story, we start to question our house's history. Apparently, we will ask about it to our parents, our neighbours, or even google it ourselves. Moreover, Google now provides a feature on Google Maps where we can look up the condition of our house in a particular year we want. 

Second, people research their house's history because they are triggered when they look at some old photos of their deceased relatives, such as grandpas, grandmas, and others, who used to live in their house too. Finding out more about the history of the building they live in is part of reminiscing the memories they probably have forgotten for a short period of time. Learning about it again might leave us staring at some furniture and thinking about our deceased relatives, ""Ah, they used to sit here while watching the television"".

To conclude, we find joy in finding out more about the story of our house. Despite we might find stories about urban legends that had taken place in our house, we will finally be aware that we have grown up now. Time is indeed cannot be re-rolled but the history remains.","## Task Achievement:

Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is considered by some that playing computer games damages children, while others think it develops children’s potential in different aspects. In my opinion, I believe that computer games could have some advantages for children in their development, while playing them  constantly could have dangerous results. 

On the one hand, many think that playing computer games develops a child’s skills. In other words, by playing computer games, children could learn to make quick decisions in critical situations, which is important in their future lives. Furthermore, they could concentrate on one goal and be engaged in one activity for a long period of time. 

On the other hand, children who are involved in computer games for a long period could face damaged results on their health. It is proven that computer games have addictive effects on human minds. Obviously, uncontrolled children do not notice the influence of computer games on their soft minds. As a result, children become absorbed by virtual reality. 

Finally, in my opinion, whether playing computer games could be useful for children’s development at some points, depends on the period of time children are engaged in it. By spending too much time with computer games, children could lose the opportunities to be developed in different fields. Take for example socializing, by playing computer games, children do not communicate with their peers at all. Computer games cause addiction in child’s psyches if these activities are out of adults’ control. 

In conclusion, playing computer games could cause a positive effect on children’s development depending on the time children spend playing them. Parents should be aware of the time limits their children spend doing such kinds of activities.","### Task Achievement:

"25.In some countries, old people are choosing to live in retirement communities with other older people rather than living with their adult children. Is it a positive or a negative development?","It is very common for people to live in retirement communities after they retire, and some people see this as a negative. However, I think it will keep them mentally healthy and lighten the load on the kids.

On the one hand, the mental health of older people can be improved after retirement by being around their peers. Retirement communities have many elderly residents, allowing them to socialize with friends and feel less lonely, ultimately helping them maintain their mental health. In contrast, lonely older people tend to isolate themselves, which can lead to mental illness. Reports published by professional organizations show that people with mental illness mostly stay on their own. Therefore, staying in a retirement community is the best way to keep them in a good mood.

On the other hand, older adults living in senior living communities are less likely to be dependent on their children. Because they are looked after by professionals in retirement, their offspring typically only need to visit them on weekends, allowing enough time for their work or family. While others who live alone may need their children to care for them on a daily basis, it can seriously disrupt their children's lives. For example, most of the elderly in China live alone, which makes their children visit their parents regularly. Once their parents get sick, the children have to stop their work and take the elderly to see a doctor, which disrupts their children's work schedule.

To sum up, while there are those who argue that older people are better off living at home, living in a retirement community is a great solution to help them stay healthy and avoid disturbing their offspring.","## Task Achievement:

Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events.  Do you think advantages of this technology outweigh the disadvantages.,"Some people use social networking sites for regularly updating themselves with current news and for keeping in touch with friends and family. In my opinion, using social media brings more disadvantages compared to any benefits it might bring.
Admittedly, there are some advantages of using social media. Firstly, social networking sites provides a fast and easy means of communication. People can anything and anywhere get in touch with friends and relatives. From any part of the globe, it is convenient for anyone to see videos, photos and posts of their closed ones. Secondly, people gets updated with latest news and reports. Real time information relating to global, social and economic matters is available on social media sites in just a few clicks. Also many of the social networking sites like Instagram or Facebook are free and provides an easy user interface.
Nevertheless, despite the advantages above, I believe that social media have more detrimental effects. Cyber crimes have been on the rise, with increasing use of social media. Many frauds use fake identities, to take unfair or unjust advantage of others, which might be for monetary purpose or revenge. People are becoming more unsocial, often lacking to take out time for those who are living along. Also, fake news is most easily circulated on social sites, with an intention of misguiding the local masses. Many innocent can get misguided and this can have dangerous effects on a society or a country as a whole. Lastly, social networking sites tends to brain wash common people by directly attacking their sentiments and thinking, through news or advertisements.

## Modified Version:

**Modified Essay:**

Social media has become an integral part of modern life, with many people using it to stay connected with others and keep up with current events. However, there is also a growing debate about the potential negative effects of social media. In my opinion, while social media offers some advantages, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits.

**Advantages of Social Media:**

1. **Enhanced Connectivity:** Social media platforms provide a convenient and accessible way to stay in touch with friends and family, regardless of distance. Individuals can share updates, photos, and videos to keep each other informed about their lives.

2. **Access to Information:** Social media has made it easier than ever to access news and information from a wide range of sources. Users can follow news outlets, experts, and influencers to stay up-to-date on current events and engage in discussions about topical issues.

**Disadvantages of Social Media:**

1. **Cybercrime and Privacy Concerns:** Social media platforms can be a breeding ground for cybercriminals who use fake identities to exploit or defraud users. Additionally, the excessive sharing of personal information on these platforms can raise privacy concerns.

2. **Social Isolation and Reduced Face-to-Face Interactions:** While social media can facilitate connections, it can also lead to social isolation as individuals spend more time interacting virtually than in person. This can weaken real-world relationships and hinder the development of social skills.

3. **Spread of Misinformation:** Social media has become a fertile ground for the spread of false and misleading information, often referred to as ""fake news."" This can have serious consequences, such as eroding trust in institutions and polarizing public opinion.

4. **Psychological Impact:** Constant exposure to social media can have negative effects on mental health. The pressure to present a perfect image, compare oneself to others, and experience cyberbullying can contribute to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, while social media offers some advantages in terms of connectivity and access to information, the potential disadvantages, including cybercrime, social isolation, misinformation, and psychological harm, outweigh the benefits. It is important for individuals to use social media responsibly and to be aware of both its advantages and drawbacks.",101
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a sucessful career, while others  believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is a common belief that learners should pay a cost for their education due to many reasons. However, I firmly believe that there shouldn’t be any barrier for students to achieve knowledge. 

Regarding the curriculum's fee, in my pointview, it is considerably necessary to be free for all individuals in a country. Although this action can cause some disadvantage in the government's budget,  broadening cilvilians’s horizons is extremely important to enhance people’s education level and develop modern society. For instance, there is no payment for the learning in Finland and this country also has a low rate in society’s problems. Without higher awareness in citizens, cities may be full of crimes because many do harm to others for their own benefit.

On top of that, it is unfair for children who were born in lower-class families do not have opportunities to obtain schooling. With the high-paid for tuition, these kids not only be restricted access to education system but also be forced to earn money at an unsuitable age because of families's financial problems in that free time. Hence, they have to mature at an extremely young age, this leads to a life without any happiness. 

To sum up, no limit in education is a wonderful key for society improvement as well as fairly treating all civilians in a country.  For all of these reasons, I strongly agree that education should not be in charge for all levels.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","In recent decades, the number of people who are eager to figure out more about their residence place regarding its history has increased in some countries. There are a number of reasons behind such interests including their safety or changing their places to a source of income for such a trend. If someone is searching for the history of their houses, they can refer to local offices or simply ask neighbors for first hand information.

In some regions around the world there is a growing interest in investigating the history of the houses by residents due to some reasons. Having knowledge about a building, when and how it was constructed, reassure the people settled there regarding its safety. Whether the building is solid enough or there are minor or even major issues, can be scrutinized by such data to take further actions if necessary.

Furthermore, as more and more houses are entitled as house museums since a celebrity has lived there or it has stood through significant historical eras, some residents research the background of their residence to earn money from it. Knowing that Professor Hesabi, a famous Iranian Scientist, had lived in a house in Tehran, change the image of that place to somewhere that is worth visiting and brought the owners a fortune. Therefore, if a building has such a history, it can become a source of income and a motivation to find about its history.

Regarding the ways people can acquire evidence about their dwelling places, there are usually two major sources: using the resources of local libraries, municipality offices, or such places where these kinds of information is classified and in access; and asking neighbors who have settled there long enough to eye-witness and recall modifications in the area. However, none of these resources can normally stand alone and needs to be verified by each other. 

By way of conclusion, whatever the rationals behind the searches for the history of an accommodation are, either safety or income, there are some sources to refer to. While some visit local offices to get trustworthy evidence and others ask the neighbors, a third group combine these to both gather information and listen to the nearby residences to guarantee the outcomes.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that climate has the greatest effect on people’s way of life. Others believe that the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"It is argued by certain people that the weather conditions impacts more on people's lives than anything else, while a few dispute that, and instead suggest that the economy of the surrounding countries in a geographical area has more bearing. In my opinion, I feel that the floods and hurricanes that results from bad weather have a greater influence on the lives of many.In this essay, I will tackle both of these views and give a conclusion.

First of all, a terrible weather can result in hurricanes, droughts or heavy downpours. These eventualities cause havoc resulting in mass destruction of both life and property. In other words, more individuals are affected greatly than can any problem in a country. Take, for example, the hurricane Ana reported in the Southern African region which damaged countless crops and lives of people. This shows just how devastating climate can be as well as the influence it has on the masses.

On the other hand, others opine that the economic status of a region delivers the greatest impact. This is so because once a region can not manage to feed and care for its own people due to limited finances in the economy, then poverty and suffering occurs. To put this in perspective, if the global trade in a region can not accord its citizens a chance to earn money and grow economically, then a lot of lives tend to get into poverty. For instance, because of its poor international market the Eastern part of Africa experiences more civil wars which has led to millions being affected. Despite this being the case, I believe climate change is the major problem for many lives.

By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my stance that the weather should be prioritised as the main problem affecting many lives severely. To this end, more resources have to be set aside to manage the prevailing conditions.","## Task Achievement:

Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"The issue of climate change was always debatable and has sparked controversy over the potential impact in recent years. Many people claim that people have more responsibility to fight climate change, while others reject this notion. In my opinion, we should work more to fight against climate change to be more rational. 

There are myriad reasons that will further explain this argument. Still, the most predominant one stems from the fact that the environment has significant influences on our wellbeing, and hurting the earth means hurting ourselves. The Covid-19 pandemic has vividly demonstrated this. The virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates' nature. As a result, many countries took damaging blows to their economies and the life of their citizens. Furthermore, many prominent business chains do not have to spend significant money on carbon emissions. In that situation, if citizens do not raise their voices against pollution, the government does not follow the legislation to protect the environment.

On the other hand, some others believe that global warming is most appealing for economic practices. Poor communities are unable to afford environment-friendly methods of production. For example, from 2020, The tech- giant company Apple did not provide charging adapters with iPhones upon purchase. Because they have avoided mining a significant amount of materials from the earth and conserved copper, zinc, and many metals used for manufacturing a charging adapter, this decision by the technology giant had caused a furore among buyers. Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that people use lots of fossil fuels for their everyday work, detrimental to the environment.

In conclusion, according to the arguments mentioned above, I feel that to save our planet and secure our next generation, scientists, policymakers, social workers, and the government should take several steps to overcome the situation and make the world a better place.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","In recent years, there has been a growing global trend of householders endeavouring to examine the roots of their own properties. This essay will put forward some attributable factors of this trend and propose two effective measures to achieve the desired results.

There are two possible emotional and financial rationales for the increased number of people attempting to obtain historical insights into their homes. The first one is that most individuals are inclined to seek acceptance and belonging, and having a good grasp of the previous owners' life stories and the accommodation styles is an optimal way to place a person's life within a much broader context of time and place. That is to say, it significantly enables a person to create a lineage for their home and connect more profoundly with a sense of self and the preceding family's past, including obstacles they overcame and triumphs they celebrated. Another intrinsic point is that a strong comprehension of the dwelling's history may also help the new possessors diminish maintenance expenditures by tracing potential risks of damage related to materials, finishes, and utilities. For example, it would be substantially costly to mend an electrical malfunction if a landlord had no accurate and reliable data on the structure.

Fortunately, there are several straightforward ways for people to investigate their residence’s yesteryear. The first of these is, unquestionably, through the power of the Internet. The helpful resource on virtual forums and websites such as NARA, Family search and Cyndi's list can empower the owners to run a reverse trace with the houses and use the advanced filters to explore the movements of their ancestors. The second valuable channel is official records, containing backups and guesstimates about the constructions and renovations. This is because every governmental agency has a preservation officer who can guide a homeowner to the right resources such as the archives, local city and town historical societies and relevant details about the former dwellers.

In conclusion, there is no doubt that a greater appreciation of one's accommodation is advantageous mentally and monetarily to the holders. In my perspective, such intensive research should be carried out with the help of online tools and authorities.","## Task Achievement:

"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this contemporary era, whilst proponents discern the view that if the country turns to be more thriving, folk will not be happier,some opponents and I are against this notion. My contention will be further discussed in the following lines.

Without any shadow of a doubt, I believe that increasing the country's wealth will ameliorate its facilities .Apart from that, when the government allocates  its budget to the education sector, the illiteracy rate will decline to the minimum level which leads to a lower rate of crimes as well.This can be exemplified by, low rates of illiteracy in Japan which is considered  a rich country. Hence, not only growing up  the funds of countries promotes education but also it mitigates unethical incidents.

Besides, if authorities support the health department financially, the quality of the medical service will develop. Subsequently, it results in the expansion of  the number of hospitals which in turn covers more areas ,especially rural countries.A prominent example is,during Covid 19 a plethora of  developing cities suffer from shortages of medical pieces of equipment and stuff rather than developed countries which were under control. Moreover,  leading countries were able to produce vaccines to protect individuals from virus infection.Therefore, what can be said is that, the high resources of nations will facilitate  the prevention of diseases and supply people with ample medicines and drugs .

"Some people say that what children watch influences their behaviours. Others believe the amount of time they spend on television influences their behaviours the most. 
Discuss both views and give your opinion","Some acts of our children remain inexplicable. While some people believe that their behaviours are coming from the content they are exposing in television, others argue that the duration of exposition to television programs is the main problem of this issue. In my opinion, I think the content and programs on television are the main sources of these unusual behaviours.

On the one hand, passing a deep message takes time, so letting our children be exposed to abnormal messages through some visual programs repeatedly for a long time, will push them to accept it no matter what those messages are. For example, during the last decades, we could easily figure out that our children are no longer have issues of staying hours fixed in one place, this will undoubtedly lead them to become lazier. if we reduce the amount of exposition in front of these programs, they would have more time to complete their useful tasks and more time for some outdoor activities.

On the other hand, I think the please has a significant impact on their presence because it shows them some chosen messages, which will alter their acts in the long term. that means the ideology of our offspring could control it by using some plan on a TV set. For example, in 2022, Disney released their movies for a sex-gender purpose which will take our children accepting unconsciously these ideas.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Deterioration is observed in almost every human body after reaching a certain age and therefore it is believed by some people that young members should be made obliged legally to take care of their elders when they face problems in physical, mental and financial terms. I agree with this statement to a large extent reasons for which will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs. 

First reason for my agreement is that laws would make young people to make plans that involve securing not only their own future but also of their parents. Usually, people take their needs into consideration while planning future. Not many consider the fact that along with them their parents are getting older too who would after some time require some support finance and emotions wise. Existence of a rule which mandates youth to take care of the elderly would help in safeguarding the future of those who have contributed in the growth and development of their respective nations when they were still young. 

Another reason why I concur with this view is that old people suffer from mental and physical ailments mostly because they have stress about their future. Since their body and brain are not in their optimum status they can't help but feel helpless and weak. Because of this reason majority of the people suffer from diseases such as heart disease, brain tumor,  blood pressure and many more. If there is a law,  for instance, that asures them their future, these problems would, in my opinion, reduce by half.   

Though there is a possibility that majority of old people's future would be secured because of the law requiring young people to look after the elders, there has to be some other law too which asks young people to save for themselves to save their future. Because future is unpredictable, one may or may not have someone to take care in the future. Hence, I have one more suggestion regarding the laws to give, which is that young people must have a legal obligation of saving money for themselves to protect their future even if there is no young member in their life to support them.  

In conclusion, having a lawsuit that requires young people to protect the future of their elder family members could help in giving them much needed security in their last years of life, however, there should also be a legal necessity for young peoe to save some money for the life later.","## Task Achievement:

"It is generally observed that almost all high level jobs are done by men.
Does it mean that the government should encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be reserved for women?
Do you agree or disagree with this proposition?","When it comes to the issue of gender discrimination in the job sector, a significant number of inhabitants stand with different kinds of views. While a good number of individuals tend to take this issue as rosy, others seem to hold opposite trend. However, I am going to outline both sides of this issue prior to giving a reasoned conclusion.
On the one hand, a great number of merits come from this affair in many ways. The first and foremost point is that reservation in top level jobs for women can give confidence to work and study more to achieve that position. To cite an example, If women feel that specific job position is reserved, she will get motivated to do hard work to get that job. Another worth mentioning point is that women will be feel equality in the work field. To give an example, whenever women will be faced inequality in the workplace, she will get de-motivated and ignore to get that type of position. Last but not least, reservation may bring an authentic person who really deserves a high level position in job without falling in competition.
However, it also seems to be more likely to come up with a couple of shortcomings. To begin with, reservation for only women can lead to create discrimination among men who deserve the top level job. For example, even though men have perfect results, women will get a job with less qualification because of reservation. Another most striking point is that this reservation system can create corruption. For instance, dishonest people or employers will hire their preferable candidates who can pay incentives.
To sum up, having illustrated both sides of this affair, I would like to state my opinion that I strongly agree with this statement as it comes up with a good number of merits.","## Task Achievement:

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.

On the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a competitive world. It seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees’ wages and payments for buildings and utilities. On top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to society if it is in good financial health.

On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximising profit; they have a wider role to play in society. One social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees well, rather than exploiting them. For example, they could pay a “living wage” to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. I also like the idea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, environmental projects or education initiatives. Finally, instead of trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, I believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to society through the tax system.

In conclusion, I believe that companies should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that money spent on developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, the government's investment has never failed to provoke debates among people. Some suppose that spending money on developing technology for space discovery is worthless, others make a statement that there are more tremendous tactics to utilize that amount of money. This essay is dedicated to analysing a personal perspective. 

Without a shadow of doubt, exploring the universe acts as a precursor to our life since it helps humans to find a new habitable planet. Nowadays, overpopulation has become a dire issue which exerts the lack of living space as well as the overexploitation of natural sources due to higher hierarchies. On top of that, with the groundbreaking development of the economy, there is an ever-increasing number of factories and private transportation. These two elements serve as a main drive to a thriving carbon footprint and then lead to air pollution and respiratory disease. While the Earth is suffering from recession, it is necessary to discover a new place as a backup plan in the future. 

Despite the redeeming features of space exploring, other fields should not be neglected. In specific, education also needs investing as it plays a paramount significant role for long-term development. Once getting access to school in order to absorb knowledge as well as hone set of skills, students will become aspiring for a quality workforce, which facilitates the company’s productivity. Furthermore, it will enhance a country’s economy. However, there are still existing problems like many impoverished teenagers can not get tertiary education, a tight budget may hinder the students from having practical experiments. With a view to addressing these issues, there is a myriad of ways that can be cited such as reducing the tuition fees, applying top-notch technology or giving scholarships. 

In conclusion, space exploration may have beneficial merits to humans, however, besides, education should also be considered investing.","### Task Achievement:

It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is true that spacious open areas such as squares and parks play a crucial role in all towns and cities. While I believe that this may bring certain benefits, I would argue that it is unnecessary for all urban areas to have these spaces. 
 
On the one hand, there are cogent reasons why the metropolis should build public zones for the sake of their residents. Firstly, the city dwellers can reap the health of benefit thanks to public places. Residents can enjoy capacious room to engage in extracurricular and recreational activities outdoors, which can guarantee a healthy lifestyle for surrounding people and deter them from potential health risks such as obesity or cardiovascular diseases. Secondly, public areas may become a driving force behind the development tourism sector because of their distinctive beauty. For example, Times Square in New York City attracts millions of visitors to the United States annually, therefore, this can considerably contribute to income from tourism services.
 
On the other hand, I believe that the appearance of these places is both nonessential and unsuited for part of cities. Parks and squares construction appears to be a challenge due to the shortage of land in some urban areas. For instance, Ha Noi has a limited number of public zones, because the large spaces would be allocated for road system or accommodation to serve dense population. Another disadvantage which should not be ignored is that public spaces require a huge number of costs such as running expenses and maintenance. This may be the culprit of the financial burden for numerous impoverished areas, where should pour budget into education, health care services instead of public areas. 

In conclusion, it is necessary for towns to have large public spaces but it also depends on each circumstances, whether or not the towns can afford them","## Task Achievement:

Do you agree or disagree?","Some individuals believe that community service should become compulsory for all adolescents in their leisure time. I strongly believe, the voluntary works can be advantageous for personal and professional life for individuals and also for community. 

To begin with, there are several reasons why I believe that unpaid work can have a positive impacts on the teens as well as the whole society. Regardig teens, teens can learn from working as volunteers many skills namely, communication, problem solving, making decision. This is because working as volunteer can make teens engage with real life and learn from others people. For instance, teens who work unpaid work on local hospital can gain experience how to  deal and communicate with patients , which this can imporve soft skills. Furthermore, working unsalaried can perpare the teenagers for better future career. This is because unpaid work is considered experience and the most companies are require experience from applicants, which means teens who have voluntary experience are more likely to get better job opportunity. 

In term of society, voluntary work can contribute to fights diseases . For instance, when the Covid-19 pandemic , many hospitals around the world required volunteers in order  to raise awareness among the public how to stay healthy and  prevent spread this viurs.Moreover, voluntary work can help adolescents to exploit their free time in valuable works instead of  commite crime or using drugs, which this can assist to reduce the violence in society.

Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"Citizens are exposed to a society with advertising. In my opinion, it encourages us especially to consume without thinking and young people especially need protection from it.

Consumers are encouraged to spend money on what they do not need. Advertisements manipulate people by employing glamorous, successful people.

Moreover,the citizens are always sold products without awareness. For example,when they watch a football match, the billboards surrounding the pitch sell the products they are advertising and if you watch a blockbuster , you very probably see products placed throughout the film.It means that consumers are influenced even when they are relaxing.

Advertisements bridge consumers and manufacturers and it informs consumers what choices they have, but it does not mean advertisements should not be regulated, the consumers ,in particular, young generation need protection form society and family. Above all, alcohol products should display that juveniles can not buy and tobacco advertisements must be banned.The products aim at young generation must be censored strictly, and they must display specific usages and harm.

"In many countries today, parents are able to send their children to single-sex schools or co-education schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. 
To what extent do you agree.","For people who are, at least, concerned, it is easy to search the Internet and discover web pages containing articles discussing education system. The point of view supposes that nowadays parents all over the world might choose to which school such as single-sex or co-education prefer for their children. The opinion considers that the same-gender schools might affect badly the childrens future. I am inclined to think that this idea reflects my point of view, and i am going to represent it by my essay.

Some recent surveys done by leading sociologists have shown that over the last decades there have been some changes in global education tendencies. One trend seems to be becoming increasingly common: we can trace the tendency by the significant reduce the quatity of single-sex schools in modern society. There is no doubt, this kind of schools influence on the communication abillity between both gender, which my dicreases the confidence, and as a result deteriorates the range of future marriges or, even, increases violance or crimes. For example, more than 90 % all schools in Russia are co-education.

Whereas this state of affairs might trigger some objections of the people who are persuaded that single-sex schools help to improve concentration among students. It is commonly said that the millitary schools should be single-sex to create special conditionals for study. Otherwice, numerous difficulties such as financial or social extences could arise.

Nowadays more and more jobs and tasks are done by machines which involve hard physical work. Do the positive effects of this trend outweigh the negative effects?,"There are many companies and factories to complete manual work, which is traditionally human workers. I personally believe that it is a positive development, although it has its drawbacks.

One benefit of machining replaces human beings, which higher output and they can work countless hours without taking rest, will not make mistakes. Using machines have more advantages because it faster to complete orders, the sales are higher, which improves economic development.

 

Done by machines, people who have less work to do and they had free time to what they want. For example, they can get off work on time and take time to relax, and keep good health, not suffer from disease due to long-term pressure or working environment.

Some drawbacks are buying automated many people may lose their job,  The company will lay off workers, due to those whom no skill or diploma to do other jobs, there is no income, who can not make a living by themselves. As a result, the social is instability.

Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news event. Do you think the advantages of this technology outweigh the disadvantages?,"Due to the advent of technology,the internet has been made available to the public at ease. Many people of society get themselves updated with the lives of their family and friends and also with the latest news through social media. This essay will focus on both but I strongly believe that the merits of this are more as mentioned above, as compared to the demerits like one being competitive and glued to the mobile screens.

To begin with, people nowadays are too much dependent on certain sites like Facebook and Instagram to get 

updates about their close relatives. They are also grasping news from those accounts rather than going through a valid website of news. For instance, India has seen tremendous growth in new accounts being registered daily by young section of the society. It is a gift of technology to everyone as anyone can use it easily.

This new boon also has a negative aspect. It makes teenagers 

scroll their media account innumerable times. Because of this, they have been labelled as “screenagers”. In addition, these gullible little beings  get influenced by bloggers and try to enact certain egregious tasks. For example, 40% of Gen Z  tends to follow things which they see on social media. Hence, parents should keep an eye on their children.

"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","It is expected that schools should devote more time on academic subjects for better academic results rather than sparing time for extracurricular activities such as cookery, dressmaking and many more. I firmly disagree with such a study pattern as these activities are as crucial as the academic subjects. This topic will explain the reasons for promoting non-scholastic activities.

Firstly, the main reason for prompting after-school activities is reducing boredom from the repeated daily schedule as these extras will act as a refreshment from the regular academic studies which will result in lost interest in studies. Moreover these activities will introduce sense of competitiveness with higher level for patience and help in discovering hidden talents among the youth. For instance recent surveys have shown that more success-full people have a good hold on at-least one such activity, helping them in retaining lost academic interest and success in both.

Moving on, the further reason for encouraging such activities is building good relations among companions by sharing common interest and common platform. In addition, students learn at high levels at school than family where they get less exposure and limited resources. Not only this but such extra activities also help in protecting students from indulging in inappropriate activities and stay career focused with good character.

Last not the least, I would always support after-class activities as they will foster the new talent and shape the future youth in the best way possible","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In contemporary society, the primary purpose of schools has been under heated debate. Many people hold the view that transforming kids into good citizens and workers is the fundamental goal of education in schools rather than concentrating on individual betterment. From my perspective, I agree with the given sentiment and this course of the essay will elaborate carefully to provide the reasons for my personal opinion.

First and foremost, it is likely universal that a good individual should be useful to certain communities. It means that a well-skilled person might not be defined as a good one if those harms or are unsupportive to societies. Therefore, schools in which children's perspectives could be changed officially and openly should mainly focus on educating moral lessons and qualifies alongside particular subjects or skills. Being community-minded, for example, seem to be a necessary characteristic which is needed to be taught in schools, especially in fast-paced life in which there is likely sympathy insufficient. In a nutshell, a community could not be prosperous unless every single citizen is dedicated to bigger purposes.

However, it is indicated that generally moral lessons are unlikely the only target of teaching in schools since the development of societies relies significantly on single and personal innovations. specifically, Throughout the countless year of humankind's life, there was numerous innovative inventions and explorations that were undertaken by genius brains that have been changing human life totally and positively such as America's exploration and invention of the internet and computers, or chronic disease treatments. Therefore, alongside the primary goal, seeking and nurturing individual talents should be taken into consideration in order to create a quality workforce for our community.  Seeking talent shows, for example, specific courses, and modern facilities should be provided free for children when they are still in school seats.

In conclusion, in spite of individualism development in contemporary society school should play the main role in educating the young generation to turn out the useful and well-educated people in their community. Besides, increasing personal betterment is not likely less crucial, however, it does not seems the major purpose of education.","## Task Achievement:

"With the growing population in cities, more and more people live in a home with small or no outdoor areas. Is it a positive or negative development?","Today, more and more people are moving toward the urban areas from villages, which causes the population of cities to grow too high. Due to the limited amount of land, many city dwellers have to live in a house with small or no backyards, specifically apartments. The fact that there are more and more high-rise apartment buildings is a result of this phenomenon. In my opinion, this development has two sides, and the below essay will give explanations for my viewpoint.

On the one hand, there are a couple of positive aspects. Firstly, building many apartment buildings helps solve the population problem in big cities. An apartment building can accommodate at least 500 people, whereas a house can not meet that. For instance, in Ho Chi Minh City, apartment buildings have solved the housing problem for 47 per cent of the dwellers. Secondly, living in an apartment helps us avoid noise and air pollution. The health of people who live near streets will be badly affected by emissions and noise from vehicles, on the contrary, those living in apartments will not be affected by traffic.

On the other hand, those living in apartments will have to pay different fees, such as security, cleaning and parking fees. This increases the cost of living for many families. For example, in Ho Chi Minh City, apartment dwellers have a 30 per cent higher cost of living than homeowners. Furthermore, if you want to open a party with more than 10 people, you must ask permission from the apartment management.

To conclude,  according to the arguments aforementioned above, more and more people living in a house with small or no outdoor areas is a great development. However, it still has some disadvantages regarding money and comfort.","## Task Achievement:

In some countries people encourage teenagers to find part time jobs. Some people agree and others don't. Review both sides and give your opinion.,"There is no doubt that working from a young age makes us independent and self displined. While some people believe that this trend should not be followed, others argue that it helps to build strong minded teenagers. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the latter view.

One of the most important drawback of teenagers involved in part time jobs is time management. The younsters who work in any part time job are mostly undergarduate students or higher secondary students, because of their part time jobs they get very less time for their studies which in turn leads to bad scores in their marksheets.  Additionally, some part time jobs includes morning and late night shifts, which is the most important time for good sleep. As a reult it directly effects the productivity of the teenagers.

However, part time jobs gives the opportunity to experience real time world apart from studies and college life. Working experience gives the chance to learn from your own mistakes from a very young age, that hepls to build the stronger future. For example, there are some students who does not have any financial support for their education, they  can earn their living and fulfill their dreams, and achieve their goals by their own.

In conclusion, working as a part time can be proven hectic for young generation. In my opinion benefits of part time jobs in young generation are outweighted by the drwabacks, I would prefer top indulge my children in part time jobs.","### Task Achievement:

Some people say that government should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"It is true that the government should pay closer attention to environmental pollution and housing problems in order to prevent people from medical issues. From my personal angle alone, I believe tackling pollution and housing problems are indeed able to improve citizens’ health, yet other measures are also required to cope with people’s illness in the short term. 

First of all, one of the reasons to reduce pollution is that it has a direct impact on people’s health in many circumstances. For instance, air pollution may severely pose a threat to inhabitants’ life since they are prone to respiratory illness and other chronic diseases, for taking heavy smog in Beijing as an example. In addition, Poor air quality may also give rise to an outbreak of airborne diseases, such as summer flu more likely to occur, widespread and infect a large number of city dwellers, especially for those living in densely populated cities where without a good ventilation.  

Secondly, it is obvious that housing problems can influence city dwellers, predominately disadvantaged ones in particular, in aspects of physical and emotional. Those who are from deprived backgrounds are hardly able to afford decent places, and usually live in slums enduring terrible living conditions. Where sewage and waste are not managed effectively, is a perfect habitat for bacteria’s growth, where mice and cockroaches  build their communities, provides the media for bacteria to spread, and where people are stressed and live under pressure in most of the time. 

However, if the authorities give priority to solve problems of environmental pollution and housing issues for the sake of public health, this probably will not have an immediate payoff as these are strategies in the long-run solutions. By contrast, investments in medical facilities and boosts to health care services can better provide instant treatments for patients, thereby alleviating their sicknesses and curing them sooner the better. 

In conclusion, I am of the opinion that profound changes in the environment and accommodations can truly prevent people from illness and diseases, but there is in no case should the government neglect the importance of health care services on residents’ well being.","## Task Achievement:

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people say that as with making a profit, companies are responsible for society. I completely agree with this idea because it can make an index to measure a healthy socioeconomic.

On the one hand, the main target of each company in the business area is making money, which inherently plays a critical role in society. If a company has succeeded in making a profit, it generally needs to grow and improve, which means more job positions for new employees, more indirect jobs, and more money for other businesses that are related to that company. Consequently, the level of poverty will decrease, the economy will be more dynamic, and society will be healthier psychologically because of the money that is on moving between people. It seems that the business leads to various solutions for a part of  social problems, and if it can make money, society is unlikely to face such difficulties.

On the other hand, businesses have social responsibilities to other parts of society that are impacted by them, but they are not inherently responsible for them. A big company that has chosen a small city to make its factory, which is routine in companies because they want a decline in their costs, can be a good example of how business can impact on society. But this decision can have detrimental effects on local people. Migrating new workers from other areas, using infrastructural facilities like hospitals or schools by that migrated workers, and disappearing traditional cultures because of communication that local people make with such workers are some instances of such effects. Companies should be responsible for creating enough infrastructures and keeping and celebrating traditional cultures, which give the confidence that this selection is a win-win situation for both companies and people who impact directly from their business activity. Consequently, reduce the socioeconomic gap can have an achievement for businesses.

In conclusion, although businesses make a positive impact on society by making money, there are other types of problems, such as socioeconomic gap, that root in business’ activities, and they should have this responsibility to reduce the negative influences of them.","## Task Achievement:

"some people believe that eventually all the jobs will be done by artificial intelligence robots


What is your opinion ?","Artificial intelligence is constantly replacing most jobs done by humans. While it is possible that all the menial jobs will be taken over by robots eventually, but it is likely that jobs required decision making and human contact are to be carried by individuals only.  

 

The robot may substitute the need of human labour for unskilled in the near future. Many companies will opt to acquire automated teller machines, in order to decrease their production cost as it is a less expensive method. For instance, companies like Walmart and other gas station companies have already set up the use of self-checkout at their stores.  Furthermore, these machines are available 24 hours and do require any vacations or pay and moreover they can be easily replaced with a new or refurbished one. For these reasons such kind of jobs can be replaced by robots.  

However, there will always be existence of such jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never be able to perform them. These jobs include doctors,computer programmer, teachers and many more. The robot can only be programmed for certain limit after that they have to be re programmed again. For instance, the use of electronic machines for medical purpose can cause a catastrophic effect on Indvidual's life. The robot might start doing malfunctions during operations.

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Nowadays, thanks to the development of the economy and technology, consumer goods are massively manufactured. However, the synthesis of these products can bring negative impacts to the environment. The causes of this problem and corresponding solutions will be discussed below.

One of the reasons for this issue is that people desire more and more merchandise, but green technology is not advanced enough. During recent decades, the wealth of people is significantly increasing, so people have more needs and wants in various products, such as computers and telephones. As a result, the supply must also soar to match the requests from the society. Meanwhile, there are still insufficient resources that can drastically reduce the pollution of the surroundings during manufacturing processes. For example, a great deal of sulfur dioxide will certainly be formed when a factory produces toys. Moreover, some non-degradable chemicals such as plastics can pose a threat to the Earth, because the combustion of these substances can create an enormous amount of hazardous gas. Eventually, the contamination and damage to the air and the land will be much more severe unless the production and consumption pattern changes.

Based on that, a feasible solution to this problem is that we should develop environmentally friendly technology. As we know, it is highly unlikely to alter people's consumption patterns. Hence, we need to figure out some ways that can alleviate the damage to the environment. For instance, the use of hydropower for providing electricity to plants can lessen the demand for combusting fuels. Additionally, companies can start to apply degradable materials for disposable products. If straws are made of materials that can be degraded, they are not required to be burned in the landfill.

In conclusion, the underdeveloped green technology and the surge in demand for goods are the main reasons for environmental pollution. To tackle this problem, we need to invent technology that can benefit the environment.","## Task Achievement:

Young people are often influenced in their behaviors and situations by others in the same age. This is called “peer pressure”. Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?,"Peer pressure has evolved as a majority topic of a concern in modern society. While I accept that this phenomenon is advantageous in a few ways. I firmly believe that its drawbacks are significant.

I agree that there are some benefits of peer pressure. The most obvious benefit is that peer pressure helps motivate young people to feel like they should try harder to become better. For example, in academic achievement, peer pressure makes young people realize they have to study harder and put in more effort to keep up with their peers. Without a sense of competition, it can be difficult to let the most brilliant and diligent students in a class shine. One more clear benefit to consider is that peers who are kind-hearted and optimistic can influence others to build these qualities in themselves. Peer pressure can encourage positive behaviors such as healthy habits, and volunteering.

However, I am strongly of the opinion that the disadvantages of peer pressure  are more significant. The primary negative of influenced by others is that peer pressure makes them feel isolated if they are incompetent and not on the same level as their friends around them.

For example, if this happens in the classroom, students affected by this feeling will become mentally unstable, feeling scared, autistic, and unable to communicate with anyone. Futhermore, young people are drawn into age-inappropriate behaviours such as drinking alcohol and smoking and then dropping out of school, even taking drugs when they feel bored with life.

In conclusion, peer pressure makes youth worse off. It is clear that these consequences are greater than the benefits of peer pressure, so young people need to be aware of its effects and ignore judge and the bad behaviours of others.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In this day and age, children are required to study a great deal of subjects at school. Although some believe that studying art is a waste of time for children at institutions, others support that it is mandatory for them to learn art. In this essay, I will examine both views and explain why I think it is necessary to include art education at school.

There are two main reasons why a number of people think it was a waste of time. Firstly, students should spend their time on practical subjects such as sciences and languages. By doing so, they can sharpen their skills for  future workplaces. Secondly, artworks are too complicated for children to understand. Most of the students find it difficult to interpret the symbolism of the post-impressionism paintings. Owing to a lack of life experience, they usually fail to integrate their viewpoints into the masterpieces. If they find it boring, it will only cost their invaluable time for nothing.

Whereas it shows that learning art is hard and seems useless for kids, there are precise values that they can obtain through studying art. The most prominent one is understanding history. Thanks to collectors who preserved thousands of art pieces, students not only can experience what living in the Middle Ages looked like by looking at  oil paintings, but also learn from others’ experiences and interpretations of wars, disasters, and historical events. Moreover, they can also improve self-awareness by knowing their own preferences. The more artwork they learn, the better self they will understand.

Art is an abstract subject that people hold different views on whether it should be a mandatory subject for children to study. By carefully assessing both views, I wholeheartedly believe that art is an invaluable subject for students at school.","### Task Achievement:

Whether or not someone achieve their aims is mostly by a question of luck. To what  extent do you agree or disagree,"Many people claim that luck is the most crucial element contributing to a person's  success. While I accept that luck does have an important role in helping people reach  their targets, I would argue that hard work and determination are much more crucial  factors leading to the achievement of an individual.  On the one hand, I agree that luck can be an important factor. First, some people are  fortunate enough to be born in a wealthy family, which allows them to have better  education or to easily start their own business without having to borrow money from  someone else. As a result, these people tend to have better opportunities to succeed  than those coming from poor families. Furthermore, some individuals are lucky to be  given great talents which others do not have. For example, Mozart was able to play  music when he was very young, or Lionel Messi already had great football skills when  he was born.  However, I would argue that although luck can be necessary, it is not the most crucial  a factor leading to success. Firstly, people need to work really hard and put much effort  into their jobs if they want to be successful. For instance, before becoming one of the  best football players in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo had to go through intense training  hours every day for many years. Secondly, a person is less likely to reach his targets if  he does not have determination. On the way leading to success, there might be many  difficulties, and people need to keep moving forward to overcome those challenges.  In conclusion, while I agree that luck is important to some extent in helping people  become successful, I believe that hard work and determination are the most important  elements","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that robots are very important to human's future development, while others believe they are dangerous and negatively affect society.

Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discussed the views and give your opinion.,"There has long been controversy about environmental issues and people have a multitude of views about whether we should take measures to ameliorate the condition of the Earth or it is too late to take action at this stage. In my opinion, having a myriad of extinct animals and plants as yet, I believe conserving the environment is of paramount importance, not only to human, but also to any species on Earth.

On the one hand, some people think that the animals and plants which go to extinction, cannot be returned and, therefore, any suggested solutions are still useless. Most of the people only concern about themselves, they do not pay attention to any species as long as beef, pork and chicken that they usually consume are still available for them.

On the other hand, others think that it is never too late to start protecting the environment by taking effective measures. It is known that animals are our friends and human is a part of animals undoubtedly. As a result, if animals are experiencing extinction, so as human do in the coming future. In other words, saving the Earth tantamount to saving ourselves.

In my opinion, having living with animals and plants on the same planet, we have responsibility to keep this place in a satisfactory state of living which is clean. On an individual level, we can do some simple but helpful things, for instance, taking our own rubbish when we go hiking or beach, turn off air-conditioner when no one is using etc. More vitally, educators should start building up students' mind at young age to allow them to understand the situation of environment and ways to preserve it.

Under this line of thinking, despite the fact that we cannot bring extinct animals back, the situation that the environment is having now can not be ignored and people should take measures in daily life in order to bring positive effect on plant and animal species.","## Task Achievement:

Human activities have negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem. Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Recently, a section of the society claims that there is nothing we could do to stop the damages on our planet. However, others hold the opposite idea, saying that effective actions could still be helpful to modify the issue. In my view, I agree more with the later one.

It cannot be denied that too many human activities have caused serious problems for the environment and wild.  Economic profit are chased by people overlook the preservation of ecosystem.There are less green plants and recreational grounds left in the city centers, but more commercial buildings and businesses occupy the green areas where are originally designed for people to relax. Not only urban distracts, but also suburb areas are used to plant agricultural products instead of leaving the space area free.    

Even, there is still a large number of people, including me, believing that issues can be tackled with effective actions. The awareness of protecting environment and wild animals has been raised in recent decades. Some governments has made strict laws to regulate people’s behavior, for example, over hunting wild animals or trading their body parts to the black market . Also, advertisements of advocating eco-friendly tourism can be found everywhere. People are more willing to changing their lifestyle by using public transportation like the metro and railway instead of driving only.

"23.Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kinds of artists including painters, musicians, poets. However, other people think that is a waste of money. 

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Every government provides certain assistance to its citizens. However, when it comes to the group of artists, people hold differing opinions. Some believe that the government should take up the responsibility to help artists, while others consider it a waste of money. But considering human rights and education, I believe that the government should assist artists.

Firstly, the government should offer assistance to all art creators because they are equal members of society. Specifically, even though the works of artists may not yield immediate profits, they are no different from regular individuals except for their professions. Therefore, when they face difficulties, they have the right to receive government-provided aid and should not be discriminated against due to their profession. Providing assistance to them is not a waste of money; it is merely supporting equal members of society.

Secondly, the government has a responsibility to support art creators because the artworks they produce can enhance education. In other words, compared to ordinary mechanical work, creating art requires artists to observe the world around them and employ their imagination. Therefore, when children appreciate these works, it can stimulate their creativity and innovation while also fostering critical thinking. As a result, artists can play a role in education through their artworks.

Therefore, from their status as citizens and their contributions to education, artists should be protected and assisted by the government. Hence, I believe that the government should extend a helping hand to artists in need, and this is not a waste of money.","## Task Achievement:

The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Others think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinions.,"Our world is driven by technology. While there are different technologies available with capabilities beyond our imagination, some people think that it makes the gap between the wealthy and the poor bigger whereas others think that it actually has reverse effect. This essay will discuss both views.

Some technologies are made affordable only to the rich people. The possible reasons are there are too many resources involved, and it is not a necessity. As a result, these technologies are seen as the exclusives to the top few, extremely wealthy people in the world. For instance, we have heard about the millianaires paying a visit to the moon. Without a doubt, this is using some top-notch, advanced technology that will safely bring someone who is not a trained astronut to the moon and back, as well as hundreds of people to work on this project. For these reasons, not every one can afford for this technology, but then, does every one need it?

Various technoloiges are made available to people from all kinds of financial backgrounds nowadays, especially those technologies that are essential in our daily lives. Whenever a new techy item comes out, it would be expensive at first but it will eventually be affordable for most of us after the market competition. For example, when a smartphone was invented a decade ago, it was expensive and usually, only one person in a high-income family can afford to have it. However, more affordable smartphones became available in the market from different manufacturers around the world which makes the price of smartphones go down significantly. Nowadays, almost everyone, both rich and poor, has a smartphone.

To conclude, although it is true that some advanced technologies are only available to the rich people, there are still lots of them that are affordable by people from any background and usually, these are the ones essential in our lives. Therefore, I believe that technology reduces the gap between the different social statuses.","## Task Achievement:

"Every day, millions of tons of food are wasted all over the world. Why do you think this is happening?

The issue of how to sloving a tons of food rubbish wasted in to the environment everyday has aroused people’s discussion. Recently, numerous negative effect have arisen as a result of this and society can take steps to minigate these potential problems.

There are two primary reason why people wasted. Firslty is the lack of accessible food rescue and recycling services. Similarly, not all restaurants, grocery stores, and other food services and retailers have access to composting systems or food donation services. Secondly, consumers expect their fruits and veggies in the perfect shape, size, and color and refusing to buy ugly food, they think that the quality of these food is not good.

There are several actions that goverment could take to solve those problem. We must strengthen food rescue systems. That means making donation services more accessible, having food and retail businesses partner with donation centers. The second solution would be setting up systems to donate unwanted fruits and veggies to organizations that help feed the hungry and food insecure because a piece of produce looks funky doesn’t mean it’s bad.

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems and traffic jams is to increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.,"Never have the topics concerning the public’s daily lives failed to attract people’s attention. And when it comes to raising the expenditure on petrol to surmount environmental issues and traffic congestion, I agree that it is an effective way to deal with the current conditions, but not the best solution. 

It is undeniable that this step can mitigate environmental contamination and severe traffic jams. To begin with, increasing the petrol price can help to reduce environmental contamination. It is conducive to diminishing the excessive emission of carbon dioxide, which is the culprit of the greenhouse effect. All of the current conditions can be largely attributed to the large proliferation of private cars. On condition that we increase gasoline fees, the exhaust gas and haze would be largely reduced. Therefore, such a measure will possibly alleviate air pollution. Additionally, an increased price of petrol can decrease the number of cars on the roads. People will choose public transportation rather than driving cars when the petrol price is unaffordable. In that case, the number of vehicles on the street will decline and the traffic congestion is inclined to be mitigated.

However, many other methods can be done to solve those issues, which are as effective as increasing the cost of petrol. For instance, cutting-edge technologies can cure environmental problems fundamentally. A number of advanced technologies have been applied to integrate traditional energies with alternative energies to design hybrid cars, which are expected to achieve zero emissions and zero pollution, thus reducing air pollution. Apart from that, the government has the ability and responsibility to allocate more money to improve the infrastructure construction, such as the subways, trains, etc. Provided that the public service can be developed, the masses can be evacuated from the overcrowdedness of the streets.

In conclusion, even though the rise in fuel price can contribute to solving those thorny problems, I am against the opinion that it is the best solution, but contend that other methods can exert some positive effects to the same extent.","### Task Achievement:

First of all, the enviroment we live on earth including all livings, species in animals and plants are suffering to pollution. Human made a vast amount of watse gas and water for our living such as driving a car, making a cloths and constructing a home. All these activities produce much of the pollutants such as carbon dioxide, toxic gas and waste water with heavy metals.

"Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities.

Discuss both view and give your opinion.","In this modern era, many business man would like to start international business in order to people are gotten more benefit. However, a fair amount of people think that the expanding business and cultural contact between nations gives many positive effects while others say that this trend causes the loss of national identities. Viewing from a general perspective, the essay discusses both viewpints, I personally agree with the former opinion for the following reasons.

On the one hand, there are many advantages will come when the country will collaborate withtin another country in many ways such as business and cultural. Firstly, the job opportunity are dramatically increased in order to both the countries citizens are gotten benefit. Secondly, they are allowed to use them own country resources while the government are obtained huge tax from business human as a result these kinds of activities is one of the reason for nation improvements. For example, many developed countries are minkled to stard marketing who developing countries such as India as a result an Indian folks are gotten many work from these companies.

On the other hand, this situations are brought more effects for loss of state uniqueness irrefutably. This trend will continue while the state will never have a chance to develop because beetween countries are always need to collaborate in any circumstances as a result many foreigners are gotten employment cpmpared to local state human. For instance,a recend survey said that many underdeveloped nations are suffered to this plan in form to they are lost their original uniqueness.

To conclude, undoubtedly this project is brought  both positive as well negative. Nevertheless, In my opinion about this plan gets more advantages to the both countries when they are being collobrated to do marketing and other events too as a result automatically both territory as well as the individuals financial status  will improve dramatically.","### Task Achievement:

"Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it.


Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It goes without saying that mother earth has nurtured miscellaneous life forms since the alleged big bang and is expected to continue doing so. There are two contradicting views about the recent concern of environmental alteration on the planet, the first of which claims that humans need to go as far as they can to preserve the earth while the other refers to these efforts as unnecessary. From my perspective, although the former notion can be supported with a decent argument, the other one holds more ground.

As for the advocation of the first belief, it is, by and large, believed that life, as in its current form, tremendously depends on the climate and environment. In other words, if the condition degrades, residents of the plant are quite likely to encounter detrimental repercussions. As all life forms are in crucial need of natural resources to survive, this could be deemed substantially vital. To illustrate, the water level changes, which are due to the melting of glaciers, impact the ecosystem marine creatures live in and to some extent the humans who feed on or consume them in other ways. Similarly, the loss of natural habitats for some species could have negative effects on them and consequently mankind. Therefore, it is deemed an alarming problem to deal with.

On the contrary, the aforementioned adversity is considered insoluble to some others. One of the stepping stones of this argument is that the problem is far too gargantuan and widespread to be sufficiently tackled or mitigated. Although some short term solutions have proven slightly practical and promising, the big picture remains quite perplexing since it requires the cooperation of nations and citizens across the board, not all of whom have shown the enthusiasm for embarking on the challenge. Furthermore, the planet we are living on has gone through more severe hassles and difficulties before, and it has managed to adapt time and time again. For instance, several species used to roam this planet, most of which have gone extinct, not influencing the course of  nature significantly. Thus, the earth itself has the capacity and history of getting to grips with these changes and coming to peace terms with them.

In conclusion, having contemplated over all provided reasons, I tend to opine that adhering to the conservative way of environment present profound aspects for future of the world, progressing with this disaster should not be neglected.","### Task Achievement:

On the other hand,adolescence has a good sense of communicating are preferable in many situations.To illustrate,they can  contribute the feeling of impressed to the examiner by starting a satisfactory conversation.On that account,this dominant ability is remarkably vital for surviving in this generation.Nevertheless,juveniles who lack this talent seem to be a loss for them because they barely deliver the main point of view to the questioner and even cause a mistake in their  transmission.Furthermore, an interviewee who has a large influence on their response will gain several positive feedbacks from the auditors and somehow one can pass the low expectation from others because of a low academic record.

To conclude,we can see that  communicating skill and the standard of pedagogical qualification have played an important role in the account of judgement.Although a person who has acceptable results from their background yet does not have the ability to talk thoroughly will also get a chance to fail because they miss one of the element contributors.Above that,we can a clear image of the tension of the competition at the moment.","## Task Achievement:

"In some cites and towns all over the world ,the high volume of traffic is a problem.what are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","There is no denying the fact that the high volume of traffic is considered a problem in some cities and towns all over the world. The traffic congestion problem is the trending problem nowadays, therefore, this essay will demonstrate the causes and the solution to this problem. 

There are many factors that unfortunately increase the high volume of traffic. Recently, the industry of cars has been significantly improving and it has motivated people to buy cars more. For instance, electric cars have been popularly introduced to us which led to having more cars running on our streets. Equally important is the percentage of rider capacity, it is the percentage of how many persons are in one vehicle for each trip, and it is approximately 1.1 riders per vehicle. This percentage is a result of people wanting their privacy during their trips, and fewer people using public transportation. 

Traffic congestion can luckily be improved. many studies have proven that with control measures and sharing awareness, traffic congestion can be improved. As revealed, making public transportation more comfortable and fixed headways can be one of the most effective ways to ensure that people are using the bus more. In addition, Carpooling concept can be shared through the people, where people can ride along with each other if they were going on the same route. Moreover, a solution to this problem can be constructing a new road for bicycles to motivate people that they can go to work using their bikes. 

On the whole, the traffic congestion problem is man-made, hence, it can be solved easily by taking some measures and having the willingness to accept new ways and methods. In the meantime, more studies should be conducted to analyze the operational performance of roads.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is a well-documented thought that the growth of fuel’s price is the best way to address worldwide issues related to the environment. From my perspective, I wholly disagree with the statement. This essay will analyze how unwise it is to use fuel’s expensiveness as a means to tackle pollution before pointing out the merits of other remedies which are more efficient.

On the one hand, it is understandable for the governments or leaders of some nations to raise the cost of fuel in order to reduce pollution. Obviously, the general public may consider more thoroughly on the usage of this unalterable source of energy, which is likely to result in the decline in daily fuel’s waste. However, it is undeniable that people will face troubles in controlling their finances and some even can not travel around because of their inability to afford fuel. Consequently, the action of boosting fuel’s cost may negatively affect a majority of a nation in the case of transportation rather than help them with raising their awareness in conserving the environment.  In brief, I would contend that it is flawed to take advantage of fuel’s availability to solve environmental problems.

On the other hand, it is better to involve people in planting trees campaigns. First and foremost, trees’ plantations contribute directly to the protection of the environment. The key rationale is that unlike rising fuel’s price which have foreseen shortcomings, numerous trees will dramatically ease the continuous rise of the Earth’s temperature. As a result, most issues associated with the environment such as climate change, which is a worldwide concern nowadays will be addressed as soon as possible. 

In conclusion, while there may be some justifications for attaching costly fuel to tackle pollution, I believe that the plantation of trees plays a more pivotal role in solving the aforementioned issue because of its direct effectiveness.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that newspapers are the best way to learn news. However, others believe that they can learn news better through other media. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, the public keep up with the latest news through different media. While, some people believe that newspapers are the best sources of news, others, myself included, think that people can be informed about news via other mass media.

Those, who claim that news can be learnt best by newspapers, believe that they provide the most reliable news, since their sources are known. Having many publishers and editors, which has been verified by official organizations, explains this credibility. Whereas, there might be no safeguards against some fake news published in other media, such as the Internet and some radio channels. However, I believe not all newspapers contain the original information. For example, some tabloid newspapers possess stories, that was manipulated in order to make the stories more pleasant to the reader.

On the other hand, there are other sorts of media, which are much more convenient than the mainstream media, like newspapers and magazines. Internet, for instance, is always available at any times, providing this opportunity to receive and check the news once they have been published. That is because, it only needs the readers to open their cellphones or laptops and google the name of the news website. Furthermore, if the general public seek the news online, they would not pay for anything, whereas they should buy newspapers, magazines or journals.

Last, but not least, we are living at the age of technology, where every facility is getting improved. I do not see any point at not using different websites, YouTube and Instagram channels, when they enable us to comment on the news or share them with friends. Newspapers do not offer these features to users.

In conclusion, I believe that the Internet is a better source of news than newspapers, as it provides the reader not only a faster access to updated news, but also it is cheaper and suggest many facilities, which newspapers lack.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at schools while others think it is a waste of time.

Disscuss both sides and give your opinion.","While some citizens believe that art is a waste of time, I believe that art is crucial class for pupils to improve their self-esteem.

     On the one hand, many people think that teaching art at school is wasting time because this is not an academic subject for students. Firstly, some parents dislike schools that  teach art to their children because they are not gaining a higher educational levelon subjects such English or math. Also, the class is perceived as a waste of time because this class is not consider as an academic subjects. For instance, according to the last study in Mexico in 2019 that stays that  art is a subject considered for private schools because this class requieres specific materials, and this is consider an expensive and innecessary subjetc to teach. However, I believe this class should be included in the school program to develop skills for drawing or playing an instrument at early age.

    On the other hand, more tutors who take more serious their children's education believe that art is a crucial class for young students to improve their self-esteem by learning art. To begin with, many parents support that music stimulates children's brain and this might help them to become smarter, and self-confident. Also, parents value art as an essential skill for children to help them know about music or drawing. To illustrate, in The United States, most of the public schools teach art as academic subject in which children have the opportunity to learn how to play a musical instrument with the help of a professional musichian. I believe this is a preferable thinking to help our young generation to learn and develop more skills to help them to succed in life.

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion","People have different views about the role and function of museums. In my opinion,  museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.  On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their objects that many people will want to see. The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather designed to be visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.  On the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. The  aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the museum’s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their  visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. In this way, museums  can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science and many  other aspects of life.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In the era of globalization, a numerous number of inhabitants have been becoming more curious about their current accommodation. The objective of this essay is to investigate some causes of people trying to explore the past of building they live in, suggest possible solutions that residents can provide and evaluate them. 

One of the major causes of having passion for exploring the history of the building has been arising with its historical value. In other words, the overwhelming majority of local organization exerts oneself to the utmost extent to share information about significant historical events via social media. For instance, government announces pictures of buildings of ancient times in order to catch individuals’ attention. Consequently, new generation, who did not live in those times, identify their homes as well as be inspired to investigate the history of local architecture. Solution for this might be researching previous possessors and the house itself, as it might have some unique differences compared to other buildings. This solution is more possible due to the fact that it is effortless to find former owners in contemporary world owing to the Internet. 

Another crucial cause of keening on knowing more about the past of the place that they live in is profit that owners can make putting up the building for sale. In other quarters, businessmen want to acquire historical houses as early as possible, since its price might soar substantially year by year, being a prominent investment. As an example, houses in Western Europe where dukes used to live cost a fortune on the international market. Therefore, in recent times residents are paying more attention to homes that they are living at the moment. Learning house’s past and its maintenance could be believed as a solution. This solution is more feasible as everyone can find any data in the net.

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion? 
Give reasons for your answer.","Artificially intelligent robots are steadily taking off the positions of individuals at their place of work. Even though, there is every tendency for most simple positions to be taken over in the future, it is most unlikely that occupations that deal with human beings to be completely taken over . This essay will discuss why some jobs will still be done by people and not replaced by robots .

In future , computerized devices will substitute all menial jobs that are unskilled in nature. Most employers will shift more towards the use of artificial intelligence because it is cost-effective compared to employing humans. For example , in Nigeria, accounting software is now being used for auditing and balancing accounts in various finance firms replacing the jobs of some financial analysts and auditors. In addition, this software work around the clock and requires no remunerations, performing better, faster and efficiently. For these reasons, machines will substitute posts that requires fewer human skills.

Conversely, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them. These jobs include psychiatrists, software developers, project managers and graphic designers, to name but a few. Computerized devices will never be able to replace some jobs because certain human beings are needed to perform those tasks.

In summary, computers and machines will most likely , in the long run gradually take up a significant number of activities. The menial professions will eventually be controlled by robots,  nevertheless, work that requires highly intelligent human skills will still be available. Ultimately, in a progressively automated workplace, limited human jobs will be safe.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Humans are destined to age and tend to become generally unable to cater for themselves. It has been argued that younger relatives should be held responsible for the upkeep and care of the elderly in their family and that this should be enforceable with the backing of the law, others have however expressed their contrary beliefs on this issue. I strongly agree with the former school of thought.

Despite the fact that it is well known that as we age, we become quite reliant on younger people for strength, mental health and for finance, young people often have little or no time to do this hence the need for making the policy a law. Who do we rely upon if not our immediate family members who are more vibrant and full of vitality and this is known by the government of each country. Moreover, it is trite that the warmth of close relations brings succour to aged people. For example, it has been established that elders who are tended to by their grandchildren or offsprings fiar better than their counterparts who are in old peoples' homes this perhaps can be attributed to the strong emotional ties that bind them together. Therefore, it has become desirable that young people be mandated not to neglect their old relatives as it is currently the case in Japan.

Another thing to bear in mind is the fact that peculiar and remarkable interactions have been made between the persons concerned over time and that memories have been created within the clan that the old and young reminisce upon fondly. Although there are trained care givers nowadays, the joy that comes with family time cannot be jettisoned. Also, when I consider the benefit of preservation of history and knowledge which benefits individuals and the entire country, through oral tales and reditions by the elderly to their younger generation, I cannot but agree that the care of the old be left with their younger generation with a legal enforcement. For instance, recipies have been passed down from generation to generation during interactions between the two sects and traditions have been preserved this way.

To sum up, I support that the younger generation of each family be held liable for the care of their aged as this benefits not only the old but also the young and the entire nation.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think the governments should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve the environments problems. to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is irrefutable that massive usage of fossil fuels exacerbates the environmental issues. Hence, many people believe if price of fuel is raised then it would solve all the biohazards. I do not agree that just focussing on one specific area which is tiny part of this humongous problem is the solution; this essay will discuss why.


Taking such measure does more damage compared to the benefit. Because of increase in fuel rates, there could be conflicts amongst the common man and the administration. Having taken such step of hiking prices would fill public with rage lead to curfews and sloganeering, for instance, hence, disrupting balance in the society. Moreover, despite the fact that traffic might decrease due to this step, motor companies will suffer and it would affect the national economy directly. However, if more effective ways like using electricity produced by solar energy or other renewable energy sources are used to power the motor vehicles then above stated issues can be governed.


On the other hand, major air pollutants are the gases and and residues from the industrial waste. Carbon emission from vehicles doesnt affect the ecosystem much as compared to toxic waste generated by industries. All kinds of greenhouse gases like nitrogen, methane, carbon monooxide etc. are discharged by manufacturing companies without treating them, this in turn leads to spike in temprature which directly impacts the climate in detrimental way. Therefore, having appropriate waste management facilities to treat 
contaminated and toxic waste before releasing into environment would help and expidite the process of saving our ecosystem.


In the nutshell, this essay discussed the reasons why raising fuel price is not a effective answer to environmental problems including decline in nation's economy due hit in motor companies and industrial waste is teh major catalyst to the biohazard. Hence, rather than increasing fuel price having proper waste management facilities should be the focus. In my opnion, I disagree that just fuel price hike is not the answer to solve environmental problems.","## Task Achievement:

"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should encouraged to question and offer criticisms on their teachers. Others think this will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Education plays a very pivotal role in everyone's life and asking questions about the course is common among children. However, some people feel for the betterment of the education system it would be great if students argue with teachers about the topic while others opposed to it and think that it will affect the respect of teachers to a great extent as children will not have that discipline in them. This essay will take into consideration both the points and at last will state a personal opinion on how we can deal with this issue?

On one hand, discussions in the classrooms are always beneficial as it helps to maintain a teacher-student bond. In other words, when a child clarifies certain queries with a teacher, it helps them to understand each other well. Moreover, frequent debating makes children confident in their future pursuits. For example, while doing group discussions in the office people feel confident to argue about anything because of their strong foundation. Furthermore, this will leads to criticising teachers when they do not have the knowledge about the context.

On the other hand, others strongly opposed it. They think that it will lead to misbehavioural issues in the class as children will lose respect for their teachers. For instance, pupils in the United Kingdom mistreat their teachers during class because of fewer rules and regulations. Due to this, teachers will never feel inclined toward the children and will not have an understandable relationship with their students. This will affect their school life as they will never be able to respect others in future.

To sum up, it is inevitable to say discussions are an integral part of every classroom as they not only boost children's confidence but also enhance the relationship between teacher and students. Therefore, in my opinion, it would be great if children should know their limits and always maintain the decorum of the classroom by respecting their teachers.","**Task Achievement:**

"21.Nowadays, more and more jobs and tasks which involve hard physical work are done by machines. Do the positive effects of this trend outweigh the negative effects?","Indeed, the modern world is moving in a direction where more routine tasks are performed by machines. While this trend is welcomed by many, I would say that we should not be overly optimistic about it, given its detrimental effects on individuals and society.

On the surface, the trend toward automation seems to be benefiting the world in every way. On a personal level, this trend frees many people from mundane tasks and allows them to do something more meaningful. For example, when mechanized farming frees farmers from tasks such as planting and ploughing, they can spend more time and energy focusing on market prices and sales. Additionally, entrepreneurs care most about the increase in productivity and efficiency brought about by the wide application of machines. However, in my opinion, these benefits mentioned above should be considered from the opposite perspective. Firstly, the era of mechanization not only failed to liberate people from secular labour but also witnessed the demise of many handicrafts and traditional skills.

Even further, as handcrafted items are replaced by faceless uniform products on the assembly line, it is even more frustrating to us that there is a lack of diversity and richness in national identities and cultures worldwide. This is because a nation's culture, customs, and spirit are inextricably linked to its traditional handicrafts. Another problem that cannot be ignored is the ensuing unemployment problem. While the manufacturing industry is enjoying the dividends of robots replacing labour, millions of workers are unemployed. This is unacceptable for any government.

In conclusion, I would say that industrialization should not come at the expense of traditional skills or unemployment.","### Task Achievement:

"Detailed describtion of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be banned in the media.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, societies all across the globe are susceptible to mass-media-related delinquency more than ever before. Therefore, some experts have proposed the prohibition of in-depth showcases of crime scenes from media platforms. This essay will explain why I agree that society might turn into a frightening place although this information can raise public awareness.

Admittedly, there are a plethora of explicit crime scenes and the media often makes headlines with them. Newspapers, TV channels and radio are mainly focused on propagating criminal acts with vivid descriptions to impress  readers and viewers. Even the most violent personals such as  Nikko Jenkinson, who is an American serial killer, are covered by media reporters in an ordinary, unworried tone of voice. This inevitably makes the general public who watches it become careless about the nature and seriousness of crimes committed. This type of explicit showcase of unpity behaviour upon committing a crime may create the successors of Nikko Jenkinson in other societies.

However, from a viewer's standpoint, comprehensive descriptions of criminal offences may actually help people to prevent such cases in their own lives. In other words, they can self-educate through this, which could assist them in avoiding criminal traps. For example, when news about unknown gangs killing housewives who opened the door to intruders breaks out, this may be a lesson to learn for other women of similar habits. Moreover, a scenic appearance of a taxi driver accused of abusing and robbing rich passengers can open many people's eyes and make them extra alert. In short, reading and watching criminal reviews on media can help other people to stay out of trouble.

In conclusion, while it is true that prohibiting the explicit media coverage of crimes can keep  society in a safe zone, I do also believe that this sort of information has a role to play in our day-to-day lives.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think watching TV is bad for children in every way. Other think TV has positive effects on children, as they develop to grow up. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Many individuals believe that watching TV is not good for  young adults in every way, while others would argue that TV provides a good impact on  teenagers, as they get older.Although, watching TV enhances a child's curiosity as well as knowledge, I believe that watching TV is bad for their health.

On the one hand, many individuals believe that watching television is beneficial for heir during their growth stages because  that offspring get different knowledge and it enhances their curiosity about various aspects of the World. Television contains different genera of  shows and programs where children learn new social skills as well as  get knowledge about different cultures and traditions from  society. For instance, there are various programs such as Science of Stupid on National geography, Minecraft, best from Waste and many more, from these types of shows they develop new skills.

It is observed that many children suffer from serious health issues regarding their eyes where they have low vision problems or blindness  as well as  suffer from mental illness due to overconsumption of television.

For example, in India, children watch around 6 to 7 hours of continuous TV which is seriously affected  their eyes and health due to this behaviour around 35% of children suffer from low vision problems in their early life stages.Therefore, I believe that watching TV is not good for children.

Most high level jobs are done by men. Should the government encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be reserved for women?,"It is a common scenario that maximum time men get an opportunity to perform the high-profile job. Nowadays, women have proved their ability in various types of field. If the Government keeps reserve the high ranking job for women then the scope to work will increase for them. However, some problems will be arising. In my opinion, man or woman whoever, everyone should get job on the basis of merit and qualification.
It is true that women always stay busy with household chores and child rearing. Although getting higher education they are not be able to utilize their knowledge in proper way because of the opinion of maximum people that women should be given priority in the work of home. Since, half of the population of our country are women, so if they get a chance to implement their education and talent in different fields then they can play an important role in the development of the country. Furthermore, most of the parents are prefer to make their daughter skilled in household work rather than study. If the Government give the privilege to women’s job, then these parents will encourage their girls for doing study.
Secondly, if women get a higher job opportunity they can be financially well-off. As a consequent, they will be able to take the responsibility of their families. For example, in many families, after father’s death, a daughter has to bear all expenses because they have no son or the son is too young to manage the expenses of the family.

On the contrary, it is seen that men always manage all the expenses of the family. If high level jobs are kept isolated for women then there will be a dearth of job for men. As an effect, they will select an illegal way to fulfill their needs which will bad impact to the society. Apart from this an ineligible woman will get benefits rather than an eligible man. 

In conclusion, over the last few year women have demonstrated skills in diverse fields. However, if the certain percentage of high-ranking job is reserved for women, there will be some advantages but also some disadvantages. So, man and woman should get job depend on their eligibility.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays more and more people want to get things done instantly (services, information, tasks). Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","These days, the communities urge to have an instant result to things, such as services, information, and tasks. I think that there is one factor to this condition. Furthermore, I have a strong agreement that this situation is a positive development for us.

The reason for this instant habit is the development of the information technology and service businesses that made everything provided in less than a minute. We can get any information in a second by scrolling our phones, like the updates of the USA presidency. Moreover, there is an excessive number of services so that we do not have to be bothered by doing a complex task. For example, the Writing9.com website helps us in doing IELTS writing exam practices by scoring our essay with artificial intelligence. 

I suggest that this is a positive phenomenon because it increases our work efficiency. The fast rate of information will push our works to be done quickly. For instance, a project manager is able to create a project charter in a short time because the person can download a template from the internet. Additionally, we are able to finish big activities by collaborating with external parties. To illustrate, in developing our company's staff, the human resource department can hire professional coaches to put awareness about working diligently in the staffs' minds.

Second, it may develop the country's economic condition as it opens more opportunities to service transactions. The engagement of people happens. Consequently, more individuals or groups need external services. In the case of home service, if someone that owns an apartment is lazy to clean the room, he/she may order a cleaning service. Thus, this can help more humans to have a job.

In short, the instant state of mind happens because of the development of our technologies. Even though some individuals may see this case with a negative mindset, I have to agree that this situation is good for us.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.  Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","People have various views about whether tourists truly enjoy visiting museums, or they just tend to acquire academic knowledge from museums. In my opinion, I would argue that visitors could be educated in museums.

On the one hand, for several reasons, museums is an attractive place for people to spend their spare time. Firstly, visitors could escape from work pressure and have a relax at museums. Nowadays, our daily lives are fulfilled with  endless work tasks or trivial stuff. When people visit museums, they would focus on the exhibition, and they could calm down in a quiet environment. This might give a temporary rest to workers. Secondly, with the technical development, we might enjoy exhibitions in a much more comprehensive way. For example, some museums provide a variety of videos and audio materials for visitors. Apart from experiencing the art visually, we are likely to be entertained in different ways.

On the other hand, some people argue that museums should concentrate on education. I would agree that teenagers would be beneficial from visiting museums. Museums is the most popular place for school trips. Students could gain real experience and learn practical skills when they visit museums. For example, young people would learn history knowledge, when they go to the local history museums. Children would acquire knowledge in favour of reading books through a more vivid way.

"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.
Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, pupils are acquiring a knowledge in the single-sex schools which were selected by their parents, and it is claimed that it will has drawbacks in their future life. I partially agree with this notion. In the following paragraphs I shall put forth my argument to support my point of view.
          Firstly, due to less communication with the opposite gender anyone will sense a discomfort and also one’s professional life affected badly. In other words, pupils, who went to only single-gender schools grew up shy and weak. For instance, personality who wants to get a job should pass a conversation in which checks ability to capable of performing under cruel circumstances. Hence, if this is a graduate of the single-sex school, the individual does not  have a challenging work. Whereas people who have attended mixed-gender institute have proven to perform excellently under any critical situation.
          On the other hand, co-educational institutions have a badly discipline issue, which interfere of their studies with allowing various  contradictions. However, separated gender schools can avoid from these problems and as a result, everyone would completely focus on their lessons.

Some people believe that schools should include competitive sports as a subject while others believe that it has negative effects on children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Sports, nowadays have become an integral part of the young generation. The society has been discussing about the consequences of competitive sports in schools for youngers. This essay will discuss why I strongly believe that all kinds of sports should be teach at school. 

First of all, the main idea behind the sports is that they maintain the body moving. As a result of it, sports make us healthier and happier. Second of all, especially for children these kinds of practice are really necessary to develop theirs muscles, bones, and even mind. For example, if they practiced regular activities more often, such as, soccer, basketball or volley, their health will be improved a lot, also they could live more and more years.

Moreover, working as a team, some young people develop the ability to understand how the world works, while some are the first, others could be the last. For instance, when I was a child, I used to play soccer with my friends during the high school, and it was an amazing experience for all of us, because sometimes we won, and others we lost, but we never gave up. Consequently, this period taught us an important lesson for entire life, that is ""no matter the final result, always give your best"".

In conclusion, I totally agree with it that there are more pros than cons of teaching competitive sports for children, they could rise mature and being better people, facing challenges no matter how big they could be.","## Task Achievement:

Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it. Discuss both views and give your own opinions.,"In a hundred years recently, mankind has been on a quest for countermeasures against climate change which he is to be responsible for. However, some criticize these additional actions to be costly with no remarkable improvements, and eventually suggests that we should accept environmental issues as they are. This essay believes that efforts to climate change should be strengthened rather than giving in due to the reasons below.

First, it is the responsibility of humankind to mitigate the impacts of human activities on the environment, and education has a crucial role to play. The increase in temperature and rising sea level has been intensified since the beginning of the industrial revolution until now. Many activities common nowadays did not exist before that, for example the burning of fossil fuel to create electricity, lighting, and mobility needs. With a population reaching 8 billions, the amount of fuel for daily activities is huge. Meanwhile, the burning process is known for releasing CO2 which directly caused an increase in temperature. What is worse, cooling refrigerants, which are essential chemicals for fridges and air-conditioners to function, are made up of global warming gases such as CFCs and HFCs. The fact is that from furniture to devices and even lifestyles, human activities is the main source of global warming even though we may not be aware of it. Education about potentially harmful human activities and corresponding solutions are important to increase the diffusion rate of new environmental-friendly technologies, which will contribute to the final bottom lines of reserving impacts of climate change.

On the other hand, some individuals claim that the adoption of environmental-friendly technologies and procedures increases costs for companies and consumers. They also argue that the debate for conservation has been a common topic, but actually the results to be felt is negligible. What is more, it is easier following conventional methods than making changes. Besides that, current lifestyle which relies on fossil fuel energy resources and plastic is more convenient than readily available compared to efforts in looking for alternatives which strive to serve the same ends.

However, climate change seems inevitable because we as human being has not done enough on our parts. Government should take initiative in funding researches into low greenhouse emission materials and technologies, especially those with versatile application potentials. Corporates should make efforts to switch to environmental-friendly alternative products and operations where possible. End users and households should deliberate choose green products and solutions over traditional ones. 

In a nutshell, resolving environmental issues is the task of the collective and should be included in daily activities for each of us. Unless everybody fulfils their roles, the impact will be exacerbated from abnormal to extreme weather conditions, from local to global. We should not trade off short-term convenience and the cheaper costs for a sustainable future because consequences will accumulate and our suffering days will be near.","## Task Achievement:

More and more people are seriously overweight. Some people suggest the solution to this problem is to increase the price of fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The recent increase in cases of obesity amongst humans is a cause for concern. It is often argued that this issue can be tackled by hiking the cost of foods that cause this problem. I completely agree with this point of view and therefore, in this essay, I will examine the reasons to support my opinion and provide a suitable conclusion.

Firstly, raising the price of unhealthy eatables makes it less affordable to the vast majority of the general public. This is because, since most people have a fixed budget to spend on food, they are less likely to splurge on costly snacks and thus they will consume it in very low quantities. For example, if a packet of potato chips cost thrice as much as it used to, by default an average person will look to buy only one instead of multiple packs. This is to say that the higher the price, lower will be the consumption.

Secondly, when the cost of commodities goes up, manufacturers will be forced to reduce production or even halt it. That is why when buyers cut down on buying their products, the company will suffer losses and hence they will be forced to stop releasing unhealthy edibles and maybe it can even encourage them to venture into making healthy snacks. 

In conclusion,  changing the price of snacks that are bad for health will result in lower cases of obesity. I strongly believe making snacks unaffordable and forcing companies to stop producing foods that are harmful to health is the best solution to this problem.","**Task Achievement:**

"Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies.
To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisements?
What measures can be taken to protect them?","The effect that advertising has on our society may be subtle, and most of us remain unaware of how it moulds us to meet the needs of competing companies. Actually, a large number of advertisements may be harmful to consumers and therefore should be better controlled in the mass media.

The negative influences of advertising from competing companies on consumers are beyond doubt. It is easy to change people’s needs into greed. In fact, advertisements from different companies constantly encourage people to want diverse things. Thus, surrounded by the advertisement, people are too unwise to perform a balanced act between income and expenditure. In other words, many consumers are convinced to overdraw the money they do not have. As a result, what seems to be good for the economy begins to backfire because advertising from competing companies may mislead consumers deeply into credit card debts which they could not afford to pay before the deadline.

Accordingly, some proactive methods are suggested to be applied. Firstly, the government should take serious action to counteract the negative effects of  advertisements from competing companies. One effective approach is to establish and impose strict censorship aiming to advertise on mass media. Also, the local TV station and Internet website should increase the costs of these advertisements to be shown or published through the public media. In this way, the current enormous qualities can be reduced and minimize their negative impacts.

In summary, the drawbacks of advertising to customers may motivate people’s greed and add huge financial burdens. Consequently, various actions should be taken by the government, TV stations and website managers to reduce these negative impacts and protect the rights of consumers.","### Task Achievement:

Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. what is your opinion on this?,"Some individuals think that artificially intelligent robots will take over the occupations that currently require human workforce in the future. Although, it’s possible that all menial jobs will eventually be replaced by robots, I believe that it’s unlikely to replace jobs where human judgements and talents are necessary. 

This essay will discuss why eventually only very few jobs will be carried out by people. 

Robots may eventually replace all human labour that does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies will turn to artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing a human. In supermarkets in Australia, for example, many cashiers have been replaced by automated stations that cost far less than employees. In addition, these automated stations work around the clock and require no holidays or holiday pay. For these reasons, jobs that can be replaced by robotic intelligence will be replaced.  

Conversely, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them. Put simply, some jobs require a 'human touch'. These jobs include psychology, education, medicine and social work to name but a few. Robots will never be able to achieve what has taken social evolution hundreds of thousands of years to achieve. 

In conclusion, it is increasingly likely that robots will end most human employment. Unskilled labour will eventually be done entirely by robots ; however, sophisticated jobs that require human-specific skills will always exist. Ultimately, very few jobs will be safe in an increasingly artificially intelligent workforce.","## Task Achievement:

Some folks suggest that, if a ménage migrates to territory with their children, it’s a remunerative act for their fate while others argue that, it will create an uncertain situation for them and detrimental to their curriculum. 

To begin with, people move from one to another region, they have to face up some adverse effects. For instance, when students attend their varsity in another state or country, they feel discrimination between them and fellow students. They might have a problem linguistically and this approach might end up with a disappointing behaviour and homesickness. In addition, their different tradition might not usually as them.

Secondly, choosing another country for further curriculum activities or for own purposes is a reasonable reason for moving into a foreign area.

"Some people think that in order to continue improving the quality of high school education, students should be encouraged to evaluate and criticize their teachers. Others, however, believe that this would result in the loss of discipline for teachers. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","In recent decades, it has been argued that teenagers in educational institutions ought to have opportunities to evaluate and criticize to improve the quality of school education. Although some people claim that students could be less disciplined than teachers in school classes because of the evaluation system I strongly believe that youngsters should become critics to enhance learning processes.

To begin with, it is a fact that students are likely to make the degree of the educational system of high school improved by providing criticism or judgement since they are the learners who are directly connected with the educators. For example, as the education department allows youngsters to examine learning processes and provides suggestions about teachers in high schools in South Korea, their satisfaction level as well as the quality of high school education have been enormously enhanced in school classes. Thus, it is significantly essential for teenagers to provide feedback about teachers in order to contribute to improving educational systems in high schools.

On the other hand, it cannot be denied that students could abuse this feedback system negatively.

For instance, because most of the surveys of feedback systems in high schools are anonymous, there are some students who utilize the feedback system in a bad way. Furthermore, it is comparatively difficult to figure out whether the evaluation and criticism of teachers are the truth or not. Due to these facts, educators will be taking an action against students carefully and this circumstance will result in the loss of discipline for teachers. Thus, feedback programs for educators should be progressed prudently.

In conclusion, In my opinion, even though there are some disadvantages to the evaluation system, I strongly suggest that the acquisition of students' feedback will be the most effective way to obtain direct criticism about teachers to enhance the quality of high school education.","## Task Achievement:

Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"Nowadays a plethora of consumers are facing the problem of an increasing number of advertisements from rival companies. This essay will discuss the  cause and solution of this issue which affects  everyone around the globe.

To begin with, the advertisement has already brought tremendous change in all walks of human life. Companies create these advertisements to spread awareness of their products among their customers. Moreover, day by day numerous companies sell the same product with various offers to consumers which led to confusion and distraction among the customer. For instance, a student while browsing on the internet to get information related to their assignment gets distracted by pop-up advertisements which attract them to look into the products and is unwilling to force them to buy those products. According to a survey conducted by Nepal Economic Forum they came to know that consumers are frustrated with the increasing number of advertisements which are shown on T.V and on the Internet.

In the contrast, it is a widespread concern around the globe through  consumer gets distracted from these unwanted advertisements which appear in between their work. In order to avoid this kind of activities consumer should use an alternative browser such as brave which will automatically block advertisements on a plethora of websites. Furthermore, the government should investigate the product that is displayed on websites, on TV and the billboard, regarding their quality. For example,  baby milk powder  contains harmful chemicals and thus led to food poison in babies.

Some people believe that the government should continuously support the development of arts. Others believe that the money can be well spent on scientific research. Discuss both and give your own opinion.,"Arts and sciences both contribute significantly to a country’s prosperity in the modern world, but which one is worth more funds still remains controversial. While some people believe that the government should spend continuously on arts, I would argue that the government’s budget should be planned more carefully and in some cases, scientific research definitely needs more money.
 
Some people think that arts should be funded in a continuous way because this can enrich people’s cultural life and possibly they can have better moods every day. If the spending on the film industry increases, film-makers will be able to produce films of higher quality to entertain the viewers, and after watching an entertaining film, these people will definitely be happier. In addition, some musical instruments can also be installed in public places with sufficient budget, and people who want to play them can feel free to do that. Both the players and the listeners will benefit from this.
 
On the other hand, scientific research is also indispensable as with higher technology, people can have a better quality of life, especially in some deprived countries. The investment in genetic engineering can increase the yields in agriculture by inventing new hybrid crops, and people naturally will not suffer from hunger any more. Finally, the research in the areas of communications technology such as the Internet can reshape people’s lives, as they will be able to get richer resources faster and many new technologies will also appear as a result of it.
 
In my view, the government’s expenditure on arts is not likely to improve people’s living standards significantly and for countries whose citizens are still struggle with a basic standard of living, the investment in scientific research should be considered first, as this is more practical and can solve some urgent problems about people’s daily life domestically.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think technology makes life complex, so we should make life simpler without using technology. Do you agree or disagree?","Some people consider that technology has made people's life difficult so it is better to not to use it. I strongly disagree with this statement because it has made life easy and united people which helps to ease the life of people.

Firstly, technology has made life easy by reducing physical efforts at difficult jobs. Labours had to carry heavy loads at construction work. Automated machines that carry heavy weights had made such work easy. Further, housewives used to wash clothes with their hands but now they can easily wash these in washing-machines. For instance, in warehouses automated machines load heavy products earlier men used to perform this. Hence, technology has made difficult jobs easy and made the life of people easy because they do not need to preform difficult work with huge physical efforts.

Secondly, technology has connected people through social media. Now they can share thoughts and ideas with their closed ones. They can stay in touch with relatives and friends. This all is feasible due to technology. This has become a medium to exchange thoughts. Humans need to be social to feel relax and better. Social media platform helps them to stay interacted. For instance, a recent research stated that social websites help people to fight against the sense of loneliness. Therefore, people can share their thoughts and feel better which make their life less complicated.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a jobb straight after shcool. Discuss both views.","While it is considered by some that getting a job after graduation is the best route to a successful job, others argue that studying at university is the best way to do so. This essay will explain both views and my argument with the latter argument.

To begin with, some people believe that having a job straight after secondary school as they able to save more money from working due to quickly starting a job than others. This is because their opinion about success probably would be having the most money in their entire life.

However, some opponents claim that it should be continued to study in university or college, and that would be the best successful career path. This is probably because they will earn more knowledges and connections during their study in college, and they can apply these benefits to their career. 

Personally, I believe that it should be studying in tertiary education for gaining their knowledge after studying high school. In today's ,world many companies solely accept people who are graduates of university or college because those people guaranteed that they have efficient information for organizations.

In conclusion, although some people believe that a successful career path is getting a job straight after school, I am of opinion that one should be continued to study in tertiary education after graduation from secondary school.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that the problem of pollution has a huge impact not only on the environment but on humanity health as well. And the question of whether to raise up the value on cars fuel or not is extremely topical today. I tend to feel that it is a quite reasonable idea and i will give some reasons for it.

To start with the price changes, we have a big probability percentage that people will put up with this and it wil not work, but on the other hand if the government suggests environmentally friendly kinds of transportation or other alternatives such as comfortable public transport, more bike paths around the city and not only on the downtown area. Another great example of replacement fuel vehicle is electro cars. But it is quite clear that such cars need special charging stations, which are rare in small cities all the more so in the countryside.

Furthermore, I believe that the biggest influence on  ecology have manufacturing companies. It is well known that the effects of their exhaust emissions are much bigger than traffic fumes. Finally, we should remember that bigger factories with  great capital should be held responsible for the consequences but not the common people.

To conclude, I do understand the opposing view, which is that gas should not be pricey because it is no surprise that society got used to it. Nevertheless, I suggest that the pushy method is the quickest and easiest way to preserve our planet. Notably, though, I think that it needs to be a gradual process, based on careful support rather than sudden demanding law by the strict government.","### Task Achievement:

Many countries are spending a huge amount of money on supporting their competitor to take part in some worldwide sports competitions.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"An often debated topic is whether countries should invest a substantial amount on international sports competition as this allows a global recognition. However, some people believe financial assistance should be directed to youth sports to reduce crime rate among teenagers. Both sides of these arguments will be analyzed before a reasoned conclusion.
 On the one hand, a nation that provides monetary support for its athlete in global events will be recognized all over the world. For example, US is widely known for its unbeatable record in women’s football competition having won the women’s World Cup two consecutive times and this can only be traced by the immense support provided by the government. This is evident that large expense on international event improves a country’s identity.
 On the other hand, many argue children should encouraged to get involved in sporting activities to reduce teenage crimes. For instance, provision of adequate facilities, sporting equipments, instructors and various scholarship opportunities youngsters will be motivated and preoccupied with relevant activities resulting in less chance of committing a crime. This is clear that financially investing on adolescent with the purpose of getting them involved in sports reduces unprofitable activities among them.

"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free times. This can benefit teenagers and benefit the community as well.
To what extend do you agree or disagree.","Young people have had a dynamic role in supporting community  and a few people opine that unpaid charity work should be a part of their daily free activities. I completely agree with this trend and it would be beneficial for both individuals and community in terms of work skills and dynamic labour force.
To begin with, the main reason why youth should engage themselves in community services is that it fosters them with working skills. That is to say, such type of activities tend to provide necessary skill, which is required to adopt a certain professional field. This would enable the individuals to gain enough working experience and would help them seek jobs. Take for example, old age homes, by serving in such institutions individuls can lend a helping hand to the old debalitated ones. Hence, by doing community work individuals can certainly shape up their commuting skills.
Moreover, such types of  virtuos deeds tend to be beneficial for the community, when people become a part of dynamic labour force. This could provide them a chance to help serving the community in the times of natural disasters. This has been shown to the world by the young medical students of Indonesia who actively participated at the time, when earth quake hit their land by providing ambulatory services to the people. Therefore, teenagers tend to play a pivotal role in performing community work.
Admittedly, unmonetized work, may it be a job or a community service, can sometimes become a source of financial setback for the individulas as they have to meet their educational expenditures. Despite this, the advantage of gaining working skills and serving community over money makes it an uninspired aspiration.

"Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. 

What is your opinion?","People have different opinions when it comes to providing financial support and attention to elderly people after retirement. While some people believe governments are accountable for assisting these individuals, others argue that individuals should plan their retirement ahead of time. However, in my opinion, governments could provide better support to the senior citizens of their country.

In the past, most families supported their parents and grandparents during their old age, which is a fact that is changing in today's world. Now, more and more people try to avoid giving any support to their elders and this trend has been growing day by day. In this case, governments should make some effort to subsidize the cost of living for these old aged people, who could not earn money because of their higher age; furthermore, housing for the aged can be built at the cost of tax money, which could at least provide a comfortable shelter to these people. Consequently, senior citizens will not suffer due to poverty or homelessness.

Undoubtedly, it is a good idea that people should also plan their retirement ahead of time to avoid suffering at a later age. However, it would be extremely difficult for people who earn a lesser income every month to save some money for their future. Even though a large sum of money could be saved for this purpose, no amount of money could assure a sustainable life. Governments could play an important role here to implement some saving systems which could make life easier for elderly people. Consequently, this will benefit senior citizens to live a happy life.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that robots will play an important role in future societies, while others argue that robots might have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A lot of millennial are of the notion that automaon will rule the society in the coming years while others disagree with the aforementioned statement. I believe that robots will play a key role in the future specially at the workplace, however excessive use of bots among the human population will have several side effects too.

Analysing the statement, due to advancement in the technology robots have become a major part in the workplace. Various man works are being handled by the machines. Especially the tasks which donot involve much logical and analytical thinking and are repetitive in nature. Engineers are working flat out on this development and soon more than 50 percent of man power will be replaced by the machines. It will increase the productivity as robots can work 24 by 7 without nay breaks.

Explaining further another school of thought belongs to the side effects that robots will have on the human society.

"Some people think that competitive sports have positive effects on teenager education, while others argue that effect is negative.
Discuss both view and give your opinion.","Nobody would dispute the fact that all teenagers need to have a healthy life by doing sports.But some people think that youngsters should not play competitive sports because it can harm them.While others think that competitive sport such as football have a positive effect on children.I reckon that all teenagers should do sports and sometimes they can play competitive.In this essay,I will discuss both opinions and give a relevant opinion.

On the one hand,I believe that such games as football or bassketball have a lot of advantages.To be honest, it can be really hard to play in team and you can have misconception with your team players.But if you learn how to work in group and have a good comunication and mutual understanding skills it might help you in future.I reckon that people will use this skills in thier future work.For example, usually employees need to do projects in big groups.Moreover, rival games can be more entertaing and more interesting then playing alone.

On the other hand, rival sports have a negative effect on children.Generally, competitive games end with anger from the one who lose which can lead to fight.In my childhood, I used to cry after I lost the game and it could somehow affect my nervous system because after playing I always was embarrassed and stressed.

"as transport and accommodation problems are increasing in many cities, some governments are encouraging business to move to rural areas. do you think the advantages outweigh disadvantages?","It is true that the world's largest companies are located in large cities. In the city many people expect to find better employment opportunities, often with bigger, secure companies. as cities become overcrowded, problems relating to housing and transport arise, because of which some people suggest that the larger companies should relocate to the countryside. while this may have some advantages, i firmly believe that the disadvantages would be far more than the advantages. 

It is reasonable to think that moving thousands of employees from large companies out to remote areas would have a positive impact on the overcrowding of some cities. there would be less traffic because of less strain on the services offered by the city-bank, public transportation, restaurants and the like. This would mean a reduction in queues and faster customer service. To add to it, housing would also become affordable. It is generally seen that because of too many people wanting to live in the city, land prices and event rents of houses start touching the sky.

the problem however would be that a dramatic reduction in numbers of people in the cities would mean that many businesses would go broke. Restaurants, cafes and other service areas would suffer tremendously. What would happen is that overcrowding would occur where the new, large organizations relocate. More and more people offering services would spring up- restaurants, shopping centers and other businesses would be needed to serve the increasingly larger numbers of people who moved to the area. in addition, the rural area may not be able to provide the enormous quantities of housing, electricity and raw materials required to run a huge company. 

Furthermore, relocating businesses to rural areas may upset many households. Children also may have to change schools. so It would not be practical to do so. Transport and accommodation problems in cities need to be sorted out by connecting the villages and cities by very efficient public transport, so that people come to work in cities and live in rural areas. Newer businesses should be encouraged to open in the suburbs; the already existing ones should continue to be where they already are. 

To sum up, relocating the companies would assist with the overcrowding problem in some cities. However, a new set of problems would surface, which would be far more than the benefits. Therefore, I reiterate my point that the idea of moving larger corporations out to rural areas would not be beneficial.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","It is often argued that individuals are inquisitive about the historical background of the houses they reside in. In this essay, I will discuss reasons why and also how folks can go about their research.

Firstly, people in some nations make historical enquiries of their residing houses and the reason is to understand the environment. Some individuals prefer to ask questions about a place before or after they move into a home in an environment to get a clear picture of what it entails to live there. In addition, there are some myths about some houses that an individual might want to know before they decide whether to take it or forfeit the apartment. For example, while growing up there was a story about a haunted apartment in my area. Consequently, people who wanted the place after hearing the story would forfeit it.

Secondly, individuals make research on the history of the apartment they stay in and this can be done through questioning. The researcher could go to the immediate surrounding where the flat is and ask some questions. This will enable the individual to get more knowledge and understanding of the house he lives in. For instance, before moving into my current flat, I asked both the tenants and people living around, thereby, getting a better insight into the place before settling in.

"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The population growth in major cities and demand for houses has increased in parallel, which brings detrimental problems. It is said that just government can help to omit this issue which I believe is the same for these issues.

People would not expand their families unless their city could support all the family members' housing. As long as people could not find a city with large numbers of apartments or flats for their children to live in, they may not convince to bring their offspring. Consequently, governments should construct buildings to decrease public worries. Urban areas that are deprived of enough houses would not be enlarged in population; as a result, that country contains old society, and many economic problems would occur as well.

In addition, if people do not find any place to live in their city, they might immigrate to other cities or even other countries. People employed in a new job, young adults, in particular, want to live in a suitable house; if they have faced not having a home, they will resign or change their living areas. As a result, that town lost its workers, so in my opinion, governments should make architecters to design a place that can include many residents; moreover, develop the suburb to encourage people to live there to reduce problems.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","Nowadays, the practice of researching the background of accommodations has gained popularity. One possible reason is for long-term maintenance purposes. Another is to uncover valuable stories associated with their assets. This essay will explore the reasons behind this trend and explain how to find relevant information.

Maintenance methods serve as a significant reason why some residents want to fully understand their living places. It not only includes the places' historical use but also the materials used for building them. This knowledge can be instrumental in effectively repairing and maintaining these properties in the long run. For instance, in certain parts of Thailand, it is crucial to know whether the house or the nearby area has a history of flooding, as this could lead to future mold issues. Understanding such risks helps owners prepare for possible problems.

Furthermore, in some areas, people believe that uncovering interesting information about their assets could increase their value significantly. Some houses may have had a famous resident in the past, while certain buildings might have been the site of important historical events. Consequently, these properties could potentially be transformed into museums or sold to individuals willing to pay a premium.

There are various channels through which people can discover facts and inside information about their accommodations. The easiest way is to ask their neighbors or older individuals living nearby. Additionally, they can visit community libraries or explore local websites that gather comprehensive information about the town.

In conclusion, there are many straightforward ways to investigate the background of properties, and doing so can be advantageous for the owner. A thorough understanding of accommodations will help us manage our assets appropriately and may even lead to financial benefits.","### Task Achievement:

Some people think the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environment problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Pollution is a remarkable phenomenon that moved upward in the current decade, because of the availability of numerous factors causes. One of the various elements is the fuel that burns through machines. In general, there is equality between the benefits and detriment that comes from fuel at the same point. As the statement mention, upsurging in the fees of fuel to a decline in the ratio of users to protect the environment could be a solution. Through this essay, I will demonstrate my standpoint that significantly disagrees. 

Initially, the government has the power to control the amount of fuel spent to transport that spread into the air and reflex nefarious to the environment. Moreover, there are multiple finance majors that will affect as a result of the rose in the price of fuel  which is connected to the global country's economic stability.

Public transport such as trains or buses, if the fuel becomes unavailable to owner own car or individuals there is a likelihood to increase the passengers inside them.

"In some countries celebrities complain about way about the way media publicize their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame.
Do you agree or disagree?","Celebrities are known and popular figure in society and it is seen on many occasions that media disclosed their private life to attract the viewers. However, I believe celebrity chooses name and fame and always want to be in limelight, but every individual has the right to protect his or her personal life.
To begin with, indeed, it’s true that the key aim of bigwig is to attract the attention of the public and be the centre of discussion. Popularity is directly linked to their monetary benefit and it decides their impact on society or country. It is observed in many instances that big guns are engaged in doing abnormal activities like posting sultry images on social media, making derogatory remarks against political leaders and revealing ill stuff from their wardrobe and they put all these efforts just to be in public eye. Media houses are also given priority to such flaming news and they keep on showing to their viewers as a headline which in turn increase their rating and add more revenue to their business.
However, every human wants to put a barrier in their special life and no one wants to make it public.

"Some people think news has no connection to people’s lives. So, then it is a waste of time to read the newspaper and watch television news programs.

In my opinion, I strongly disagree with this notion, and my opinion will be discussed in further paragraphs. After which I will lead to a logical conclusion.

Supporting my disagreement to the given statement, I firmly believe that digital newspaper or traditional newspaper play an important role in people’ live nowadays. In the light of the fact that this can help people get more information happened in that day around the earth. To cite an example, if we do not read a newspaper we cannot know about the war between Russia and Ukraine.

"Some people argue that we should do research into their family history. Others, agree with the view that we should focus on the present and future generations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There are controversial perspectives heating up a debate whether it is crucial to do research into family background or concentrating the present and next generations is necessary. While each has its own merits, I would contend that it is optimal to combine both mentioned factors.

Without a shadow of a doubt, it is essential to investigate family trees in order to enhance people's understanding of their ancestors' cultures. To be specific, understanding traditional habits enables people to have a good understanding of their own identity and pass it down through generations. In Vietnam, for example, when the Lunar New Year arrives, a steady stream of adults take their toddlers to churches near their homes to offer incense and provide children with family history. Hence, having a good understanding of the family history is of paramount significant. 

While the importance of studying the history of family is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if focusing on the younger generations is ignored. To be particular, the offspring are the ones who will follow in the footsteps of their ancestors in the future. In Vietnam, for example, there are numerous families who own a private corporation and prolific businesses. As a result, their descendants will be able to carry on the family's traditional vocation. As a result, focusing on the younger generations is also critical, as they will carry the entire family's career in the future.

To sum up, although looking back to family background plays a paramount significant role in providing cultural tradition for everyone, laying stress on the young is of essence as they will carry the future career of a family.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Nowadays many people are trying to discover the past of their house. There might be a lot of reasons to do this. I suppose, there are two reasons which have a significant role in this. One is curiosity and the other is the antique value of the house and the durability of the house. They can learn through the internet or from their elder neighbours. 

To begin with, people can search the past of their living space out of curiosity. An old house typically looks different from a new house. Consequently, people may get curious to learn about their houses. They might want to know more about the story behind the construction of the building. Such as, how was it looked before, what kinds of people used to live there, and who was the architect of the residence! Moreover, some may try to connect themselves through the archaeology of the building. Thus, people may get interested to explore more about their living space out of mere interest.

Secondly, some people may try to find out the history of their house due to safety concerns. They try to be assured whether the house is safe for living in or not. In other words, the time of making a house may help them to understand when they might have to renovate the residence. Furthermore, old buildings have antique value. For example, the media industry rents this kind of house for movies or TVCs at a high price. Thereby, things like safety concerns or antique value could be another reason for people to get interested in the past of their mansion.

There are many ways one can research their apartment or building. For instance, the internet and the elderly neighbours are the best sources to research the past of the building. In recent years, the internet has the data of old houses. Hence, one can collect information online. Additionally, elderly neighbours could play a significant role in this regard. They might have much detailed information which cannot be found on the web. 

To sum up, knowing the history of their own building makes people feel confident and special about their house. If people know about the time when it was built they can take the proper cautious approach. They can talk to local people and use internet platforms concerning facts.","### Task Achievement:

"Nations should spend more money on skills and vocational training for practical work, rather than on university education.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many today feel that countries should prioritise vocational training over higher education due to changes in the labour market. In my opinion, though there are strong economic reasons to support this idea, university education holds greater value.

Those in favour of more practical skills training point out the financial benefits. Most university graduates are burdened with student debt and face uncertain job prospects. In contrast, training schools are cheap, fast, and ease students into steady employment immediately. The jobs they train for are also most likely recession-proof and durable, including positions as cooks, hotel managers, and skilled technicians. Someone who is firmly established in such a job in their early 20s does not have to deal with the pressure associated with university life and its incumbent debts. Instead, they can begin to set aside money for a house or start a family.

Nonetheless, lacking a university degree limit one's options. The jobs available will pay well initially and be secure, but offer narrow scope for advancement and virtually no opportunity to switch the career paths. An individual with a university degree, on the other hand, might begin from a lower position, but has a higher ceiling on future earnings. It is also possible for them to explore a variety of fields. Most good jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree even for simple internship vacancies. Lacking such a degree, means restricting oneself to manual labour or service industry jobs. The actual learning that takes place at university, particularly for those with multi skills majors or studying at liberal art schools, also encourages students to consider a wide range of possible career options.

In conclusion, increasing funding for vocational training is an attractive yet short sighted approach that curbs possibilities. Governments ought to continue to support higher education even in dark economic times in order to reap future rewards.","### Task Achievement:

People think that government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinion.,"It is widely believed that one solution to environmental problems would be for governments to  raise the price of petrol. While I consider that this might be an effective measure, I would argue  that other measures might have an even greater impact.  If national authorities raised taxes on petrol, this would address two environmental issues. Firstly,  in terms of private cars, motorists would limit the number and length of their journeys to  compensate for the extra expense. Governments would then be forced to upgrade and expand  public transport provision, as people would still need to travel to work, to school or to travel to  shops and hospitals, for example. Secondly, from the perspective of freight services, more  goods would have to be transported by rail rather than by truck. Both these measures would cut  down on emissions from vehicles and help to reduce the greenhouse effect.  On the other hand, while this rise in fuel prices might be a useful stopgap measure, governments  could adopt transport policies which would be more effective in the long term. The local  authorities in London, for instance, introduced a congestion charge on all vehicles visiting the  city centre. They use the money raised to subsidize the cost of fares and to invest in transport  infrastructure. In turn, this has improved the air quality in the city, as a result of the reduction in  exhaust fumes. Another policy would be to introduce free bus and train passes, as the increased  use of public transport would reduce pollution from private cars and help in the effort to combat  global warming.  In conclusion, a sharp rise in petrol prices would be a useful environmentally-friendly transport  measure, although in the longer term other steps would be more effective.","## Task Achievement:

It is important for all towns and cities to have large outdoor public spaces such as squared and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"There is no denying the fact that  public spaces in towns and cities can be an arguable subject. While it is a commonly held belief that some individuals believe that outdoor public spaces it is important for towns and cities. there is also an argument that opposes it. In my opinion, I consider that  public spaces it is crucial because they can be used as venues for cultural events, and festivals.

To begin with, parks and squares can help  prompt community interaction like social hubs. In other words, it serves as a space where individuals from different backgrounds can interact, fostering a sense of community and belonging. In addition, it can assist in elevating the levels of health and well-being. For example,  it provides environments that encourage physical activity and relaxation, which are essential for maintaining mental and physical health.

Another point to consider, outdoor public spaces have an environmental benefit. It is also possible to say that, it helps  reduce urban heat islands, improve air quality, and provide habitats for local wildlife. Moreover, it can be used as a landmark for economic advantages. For instance, Well-maintained public spaces can boost local economies by attracting tourists and increasing the value of surrounding properties.

Some people think that children should learn to paint and draw. Others believe that is a waste of time. Discuss both views.,"There are conflicting views about whether children should learn arts or not. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument，followed by my own perspective.

Firstly, studying these subjects of children may have more fun after school.

If it is a free choice to choose what they want to learn after class, they will

feel much happier without stress of school. If arts are touched when they

feel relaxed, the different kinds of knowledge will be received that their

brain might relate all skills easier. If the knowledge and skills are learned,

then they will be inspired to use original ways to think, which can

encourage their creative thinking.

However, those who support the idea of learning paint and draw is a waste of time can also justify their opinion. Some parents think the successful education means high ranking of exams that can make their development better in the future. So these children need to focus more on academic subjects, like Math, English......and spending more time to study skills to prepare for exams instead of learning arts.

In my opinion, children should learn paint and draw at an early age. Although some people believe that is important to study main subjects in school. In fact, giving freedom and relaxation to learn arts could help them to study other subjects with related. And receiving creative thinking by knowledge in different fields that can be really an advantage in the future development of the children.","## Task Achievement:

Restoration of old building in main cities involves enormous government expenditure. It would be more beneficial to spend this money to build new houses and roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, the pressing need to provide shelter for the community is a mainstream issue being addressed by the government. However, the capital invested into construction renovation is huge compared with the cost of original housing development. I couldn’t have agreed more that this amount should rather be used for modern expansion alongside transportation routes. Analyzing the need for urbanization and the effect of construction retrofitting will justify it.

Firstly, more than half of the society's population lacks a home in developing countries thereby encouraging human habitation in slums, where they have always been exposed to environmental disasters such as floods, outbreaks of diseases, and insecurities. For instance, urban cities across the world have been experiencing congestion due to overcrowding. Hence, erecting lodges in areas that are yet to be developed will be more advantageous to society.

Secondly, of,course the approach of retrofitting as an alternative to building construction may be cheaper, particularly in the case of smaller projects. Yet, the risk attached to the processes involved could incur more costs. For example, the demolition of structural elements of the existing buildings, if not handled by experts could lead to vehement loss and even death, contrary to the budget. Thus restructuring of housing should best be considered as the last result of expanding housing.

In a nutshell, the government's record of a large amount for developing readymade houses as against contemporary homes and access roads, calls for the need to consider the option of investment with respect to project size and expertise.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.,"These days,there has been a heated argument about environmental pollutions from car exhaust.Some people believe that increase the fees on oils can solve this issue while there are others who do not think that. From my own point of view, I think it will help to sort out this problem.

   On the one hand, the fuels is one of the most reason lead to environmental problems and global warming , but the same time considered the main vital material all over the world.To clarify, without fuels the economic and the productivity for any countries will be very low . For example , Saudi Arabia of of the rich countries because they are used this in effective way , which are impact the most of our life .

  On the other hand, this does not mean that the negative side should be neglected.Firstly, the more vehicles in the street the more air pollution will be especially in the capital city .Take India as an instance, the last studies that conducted by the university of India have been shown that the cities with high population rate and traffic congestion more like to have these problems.As a result , there are a lot of neagative impact on the environment and on each individual ,such as global warming and some respiratory health disease.

Consumers are faced with increasing number of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"The world is becoming a competitive place. Hence, to survive the competition, businesses come up with innovative advertisements. Although it should focus on the utility of the product, nowadays it contains harmful facts. This essay will discuss that how consumer behaviour is influenced by them as well as will also discuss possible ways out to overcome this that are mainly enablement of stricter acts and educating the people.

Firstly, the advertisements have an enormous impact on the way customer behaves. The colourful digital content frequently portrays beneficial usage of the product. Thus, without much ,knowledge humans believe them. For example, although the food of KFC is labelled as unhealthy by various countries, buyers do not pay much attention to such alerts. This is mainly due to the attractive story that their advertisement communicates. Henceforth, I believe that the public receives an erroneous message from them which influence their purchasing habits.

However, the introduction of proper regulatory laws, as well as spreading awareness in  society can solve the long-term problem. The government should set up a regulatory body that will monitor all of them before they are released for the citizens, as well as they should also check the content of it. Besides that, a mass education camp about numerous daily use commodities should be launched. These events should focus on educating the commoners on the utility of commonly used things. For instance,  paracetamol tablets, are available in the market with numerous brandings. Although the work of it is same, some of them are expensive. As we are not aware of the generic names; thus, we trust the advertisements and buy the costly ones. Moreover, if we watch the TV commercials of such companies, they are misleading. Henceforth, the authorities should investigate such cases, and ensure that the fallacious facts are not getting communicated through the mass media.

To conclude, in my opinion, humans are mesmerized by things that they see visually every day. Therefore, such visuals play a vital role in their shopping patterns. Hence, it is the responsibility of the governing bodies to administer advertisement and to protect the habitats of a country by teaching them, so that they do not fall into misleading traps.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.

What is your opinion?","In today’s time, some people are of the opinion that almost all occupation will be replaced by artificial intelligent robots.  I am of the opinion that the profession which required no or less skills would be replaced by robots, but highly skilled jobs will still be done by humans.   

The work which are less skilled work will certainly be carried out by the robots.  Hiring a person for a menial job like security guard, parking ticket checker etc requires a lot of money for an employer.  So, it is highly likely they will deploy robots instead of humans which are cheaper and need less maintenance, due to this, the company profit will go up.  For example, in a manufacturing factory, there used to be a lot of workers and now all the work has been replaced by machines that was only one time investment.  As a result, the employers are making huge amount of profits.  
For this reason, unskilled jobs will be replaced by artificial intelligence.  

On the other hand, jobs that require professional expertise and special skills can never be replaced by artificial intelligence. For example, psychologists, teachers and doctors are profession which require human interaction, and expertise  cannot be replaced.  Those profession have taken hundreds of years to develop, hence are highly unlikely be replaced by the machines. Moreover, robots can do a work which is of repetitive nature, a task which requires logical thinking and application of knowledge will not be affected by them.  

In conclusion, in my opinion, the jobs which require special training cannot be replaced, on the other hand, laborious or low skilled work will eventually be done by the robots in the future.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of news.
Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages ?","Nowadays, there are numerous platforms available for social networking and to update themselves with the happenings around the world. In my opinion, they should use social sites to connect with different communities around them, but with caution. Further in my essay, I will pen down a few benefits of using social applications, followed by their disadvantages.

To begin with, the primary advantage of using social media is eliminating the communication barrier caused due to distance. Moreover, one can update himself with the latest news that has been trending around the world. Also, getting to know different people globally proves beneficial in exchanging knowledge and different thought process, which assists in widening the perspective. For instance, one of the employment-oriented online services helps connect people with similar interests and gives an insight into various skillsets used across the firms. This can bring like-minded groups closer.

On the contrary, the over abuse of social platforms can lead to loss of valuable time, which otherwise could have been used for productive work. Furthermore, lately, the cybercrime rate has increased tremendously in the past few years. For example, recently, a woman was robbed by a fake profile who claimed to be a bank official. Since the practice of such platforms does not come with identity verification, which means there are high chances of confronting fake profiles.

I believe that the advantages of using social media are more than its disadvantages because it helps exchange knowledge, and the only downside is its uncautious use.

In conclusion, if used cautiously, social media can help find like-minded people. Conversely, it can lead to a severe loss of time and money with continuous irrational use.","## Task Achievement:

Parents should encourage children spend less time in studying and more in doing physical activities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some folk believe that parents should encourage children to do more physical exercise, even though this possibly means less time spent on studies. Considering the declining health of many students, I agree with this opinion.

This is because a formal legal degree requires students to pay a certain degree of era and energy to participate in various courses and pass various examinations. These are the embodiment of a student's abilities such as patience, persistence, knowledge, problem-solving ability, etc. Employers prefer to be more willing to employ employees by adopting the standardized means of ""adopt discipline"", or even offer promotion. In this case, people with academic qualifications are more likely to succeed in their careers.

But it does not automatically mean that academic qualifications can contribute to success in life every time. Education often means that a student can answer some questions, review lessons, and so on, but when it comes to problems in soul or problems between people, education can do nothing to be less functional in social interaction. Other people if he wants to succeed in a career, it's not enough to have a job.

 Most of the time, the friendship between family needs sincere integrity to maintain; Children's success needs a person's good quality, such as equality, justice, and politics, which are not directly related to education but can make people achieve success in different aspects of life.

Overall, doing physical activities is important to children’s health and if arranged properly, it can also facilitate children’s study.","### Task Achievement:

"studies show that many criminals have a low level of education. For this reason, some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they could get a good job once they are released. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","A section of people holds a belief that the effective method to lessen the crime is to provide theeducation to the folks in prison, hence, it will be ultilitarian for them to get a job later. I completely agree that it is better that prisoners receive the education rather than letting them unemployed once they are out of prison.

Firstly, it is vital to the people in jail to receive a better education as they deserve to seize a second chance in the life. Therefore, this opportunity will give them a new hope to redeem their dark past in order to be more succesful people, as well as to mend some low minded society that people cannot be succeed provided that they have a criminal record. For instace, with proper exposure learning, these kinds of people may get a suitable job that suit with them, as some occupations still require their workforces.

Secondly, the provided education will ease the the prisoners to get a job placement. It is undeniale that is not easy employers to employ people who have criminal record, nontheless, with all the knowledges that they seize from that education are less likely able to open people eyes to hire them as a employee. Thus, this is a prominent parameter in assisting people to get a job that the authorities need to consider.

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Museums are seen as a place with different functions, some people take it to be an entertainment option, while others believe museums are meant to be a schooling method. In my opinion, I do believe museums are places to educate oneself, with more enjoyable ways of learning comparable to just reading a book. 
However, various things like games, antiques and ancient stories may be found in museums, the main reason why they were invented was more likely to teach people about certain topics or interest according to the museum's content. For instance, teachers at schools may refer to these places for their students or even organise a visit to any of them as part of their classes, because museums can be seen as a significant place full of knowledge.
On the other hand, museums are thought to be an entertainment option many could choose to visit. Because of the variety of information and distinct manners used in the museums to display what they want the people to enjoy such masterpieces, antiques or games related to a historical moment; these places can also be entertained for some people. Therefore, tourists, for example, could decide to go visit a museum of a place they are travelling to, in order to learn more about the city or region in general, which will also be an entertainment option because they decide to do this activity as part of their vacation.
To conclude, personally I think that museums have both purposes: to educate and to entertain people, because there can be seen as a different type of schooling where people of all ages can visit to learn about a specific topic with materials that help completing the understanding and the knowledge learned, while having some fun.","## Task Achievement:

Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect. Others say playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"While it is commonly believed that playing on technological devices is disadvantageous for children, other people insist that video games may help the development of children in many ways. In my opinion, I consider that playing computer games would be harmful to children. 

On the one hand, some people think that children who play computer games their characters will change for the worse, and I agree. In other words, most computer games encourage violent tendencies such as aggression, antisocial behaviour and recklessness. Definitely, all these make children get angry very easily with others, even for the most trivial things. This is because of the negative influence of electronic games. More and more playing on technological devices , especially in evil games, children's language tends to be violent. Furthermore, computer games take up much of children’s leisure time. To put it simply, many children have become addicted to electronic games, so they spend a lot of time on the computer uselessly. As a result, they neglect the essential things in their lives, such as study assignments, housework and other basics of life that they have to be keen on. 

On the other hand, it is claimed by some that children can have many educational benefits from computer games. For example, they help children develop problem-solving, motor skills, using muscles and analytical skills such as drawing conclusions, seeking alternatives and making predictions, so many children who have a dread of problems or who do not like to learn all of these concepts outside or in schools, they could learn them from technology programs and games by themselves. Another reason why computer games are useful is that computer games are designed to be entertaining for everyone. That is to say, most computer games offer a multiplayer function, inviting people to share their entertainment, so children of this age love to have a lot of fun, and they prefer this entertainment so as not to feel lonely or depressed. 

To sum up, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that plenty of computer games are harmful to young people. I suppose that we need to encourage children to reduce playing games in their life.","## Task Achievement:
The essay addresses the given task by discussing both views on the impact of computer games on children's development. The candidate provides clear and coherent arguments, addressing all parts of the task and supporting their opinion with relevant examples.

"Some people think that the best way to become successful in life is to get a university education, whereas others say this is no longer true. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Many people believe that getting a university education is the most essential key to becoming successful in life. However, the counterparts disagree with this idea and reckon it is no longer work at present. From my point of view, I would go with the latter view as I think a university admission is not all that people should give in their lives, but it is the effort in doing something that will lead them to what they want. In the following paragraphs, both of these views will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached.

On the one hand, it is true that most people in society prefer to enrol in a university. First of all, other than getting a degree certificate, they believe that a university is the best place for them to gain some skills and wisdom such as communication and management skills, and theoretical knowledge. Furthermore, they think that enrolling in a university would heighten up their educational backgrounds as well as have more opportunities to be hired in a better job position. To exemplify this, there was a piece of news reported that more than 70% of the employees working as managers in different types of companies have completed a bachelor or at least  4 years of university without taking a gap year. It can be said that the qualifications from universities lead to a better spot in society. Hence, they create a pathway to a successful life.

On the other hand, I reckon a university is not everything in humans' lives. It can not determine the values of humans nor the quality of life, especially whether a person will be achieving their life's goals or not. I would say that passion, effort, and experiences are what lead the public to success ,not a degree certificate.  Having a higher educational background does not mean a person will accomplish their goals. For instance, Wownam, one of the richest and successful entrepreneurs in Thailand. She was able to earn 100,000,000 baht from selling her own beauty products within the age of 20. Moreover, she did not attend a university but took those times to gain experiences in getting herself involved in a business until she decided to make her own brand, which is still the talk of the town today. Her brand impressed and at the same time amazed society as she has not taken any university's courses. Thus, having no high qualification from an educational institution does not mean a person will be facing a failure in life.

In conclusion, although there are numerous benefits in achieving academic degrees from universities, I would still say that the most crucial part of being successful is to give all our best in everything we do. This is why I opine that the advantages of having passion and inserting a lot of effort are clearly outweighed the benefits of having a university education.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What do you think are the reasons for this? Do advantages of this trend outweigh disadvantages","The trend of people deciding to have kids late is increasing. The reason for this surge could be that people want to follow their dreams. I believe that it is not beneficial to have children late as it creates health issues. This essay will discuss the possible reasons for the rise of this trend  and will highlight the negatives of having kids later in life.

Young people nowadays want to be carefree  and would want to enjoy their lives to the fullest. They live by the ideology you live only once, so live your life to the fullest, and they want to chase and achieve their dreams. For instance, a person who dreams to tour all the countries wouldn't want to settle down to have a kid until he achieves his dream. So youngsters want to follow their dreams and they don't want the duties of raising a kid till they accomplish their goals in life.

On the one hand, having babies late in  life can lead to health issues for  mothers and infants. To illustrate, studies show that women above the age of '40s do not have all the essential nutrients at the recommended level compared to women in '20s, for instance, the calcium level in women starts to decrease, and other essential hormones which are responsible for producing milk after the delivery gets affected. As a result, the well-being of the newborn is affected. However, there are some positives to having children late, as it helps parents to settle in life. For example, young parents would get an opportunity to pay off their outstanding loans that they would have taken for education. Although, having a baby later in life has some advantages, but the disadvantages outweigh as it affects the fitness of both parent and the newborn.

To sum up, it is observed that young people nowadays want to follow their dreams and would wanna achieve it before having kids which led to the increase in the trend of people having kids late in life, but having kids late in life has a direct impact on the health of babies and mother. However, there are some pros of having kids late, but the cons are more than the pros.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Certain individuals expect the youngsters to be engaged in more charity work without being paid as it would be constructive to the youth and the society equally. Additionally, recently conducted surveys have suggested aiding the community without expecting any in return has a significant impact over the maturity of the adolescents. Thus, I stand as a strong advocate of this concept, and the benefits of it will be covered in this essay. 

A fundamental reason for this is there is no biological age for lending a hand to others to establish a better neighborhood. Hence, the teenagers can play a vital role in enhancing the concept of an amiable lively hood is the key to united society. If these adolescents keep spending their leisure time cleaning the surrounding of their respective areas, it will send a message to the whole community of the need of a clean environment, which would eventually be engraved in the mind of the people. For example, in many parts of Sri Lanka the youth has established several clubs to serve the community in their spare time which has eventually got the attention of the elders as well.

Furthermore, a major benefit received through the volunteering is the skill the adolescents acquire: time management. One of the vital issues often arise by the employers is the inadequacy of the interviewees, employees to tackle time effectively. When the child is exposed to serve the community at a young age, he/she would learn to manage his/her time efficiently which would indirectly have a pragmatic effect on balance of life while relieving the parents of the burden of worrying of their young children. A survey conducted by a group of undergraduates highlight that the students who were engaged in various community projects have the highest potential of securing a career position even before they graduate. 

Despite being a supporter of this non-paid voluntary work, I strongly recommend incorporation of a mechanism to appreciate these services of the youth would encourage the next in line to be a part of these types of services.","## Task Achievement:

"Many countries spend large amounts of money on preparing competitors in major world sporting events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cup. Instead, this money can be spent on encouraging children to take up sports at a young age. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this day and age, several countries invest a huge amount of money in athletes joining sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cup. However, it is believed by some that this amount of money should be diverted to encouraging children to take up sports. It is my firm belief that the government should allocate funds to both.

On the one hand, there are several merits of investing in athletes taking part in sporting events. To begin with, when the performances of the athletes are outstanding, numerous visitors might come to the host country of the event in order to watch those participants. As a result, the host country can earn a large amount of profit thanks to tourism. Moreover, the country’s image can be promoted due to the fame of these accomplished sports players. For example, there are lots of people who know about Korea and Japan because these 2 countries organized the World Cup in 2002, a sports event in which there were many well-known sportspeople. 

On the other hand, I personally believe that it is also practical to spend money on promoting children to practice sports. First, playing a sport may help children to improve their health, both mentally and physically. After spending long hours at school, children might be under a great amount of stress. However, they can opt for a sport as a hobby in order to relax and this might help improve their mental health. Also, by playing a sport for a long time, their health can be significantly enhanced. Second, it can be easier for children to make lots of friends when playing sports. As a result, this may help them to become more outgoing and more confident because they will have several chances to communicate with others. 

In conclusion, although some think that the authorities should invest in encouraging the young generation to take up sports instead of using a large amount of money for athletes, it is my firm belief that the government should spend on both sides.","## Task Achievement:

Parents should encourage children to spend less time studying and more time doing physical activities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued that parents should urge their offspring to allocate more time for practicing sports rather than studying. In my opinion, I would completely disagree with this statement because physical activities might distract them from their school's homeworks althought it would improve their fitness. 

It is believed that playing sports has significantly contributed to the wellbeing of children. This is because a physical exercise could help students to move their bodies and burn all the colories that were gained from eating fast foods. Playing sport games, such as football, basketball, and swimming could stimulate children to follow more active lifestyle, and therefore it would lower their stress levels coming from school as well as enhancing their motor skills.

However, I would go against this perspective because spending more time in physical practices would negatively affect their academic performance at school. This is because when children get fully immersed in certain type of sports, it would immediately become more difficult for them to concentrate on studying as well as understanding their teacher's explaination. For instance, many football players have failed to finish their education because their parents were supporting them to focus more in practicing rather than successding in their exams. This would result in establishing a successful career or life in the long run as they will not have the necessary skills and education. 

To sum up, although it might seem sensible to motivate children to spend more time in playing sports than compeleting their school assignments because it would heighten their fitness, it would impede their intellectual and cognitive development that are important for their future lifestyle.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","When they finish academy, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a profession straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university. 

The option to start work straight after university is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career. 

On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better position opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the work market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from an educational institution or college will not be able to compete. 

For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond academy level.","## Task Achievement:

"It is generally observed that almost all high level jobs are done by men.
Does it mean that the government should encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be reserved for women?
Do you agree or disagree with this proposition?","In the present world men are doing high level jobs. Women also should be equally empowered to do the same level of high performing jobs. 

The possible reasons preventing the women from doing high performing jobs are lack of motivation, interest, stereotypical society, lack of support from the family and improper education. By considering all these scenarios,some nation's  are trying to lure women into high paying jobs by providing incentives such as free travel, financial support for education, maternity leaves and giving reservation in some sectors exclusively for women. Also, it's the responsibility of the family and society to assist women to empower them. 

One more thing frightens women  for the jobs is harassment at work places. As per the study by the university of Columbia companies where there are stringent laws against gender inequality and sexual harassment,there is more contribution of women in the success of the companies. It's a proven fact that nations whose women is educated and empowered are thriving more than their counterparts. If we provide the workplace a safe place for women then there will be more enrolments of female employees. The Government  should also take precautionary measures such as making awareness in men about the gender equality, free education for girls at least until high level etc. Proper counselling should be provided for the poor women in the society about the opportunities they have and the efforts taken by the government to support women not only in jobs but also in all areas which makes women stand equal to men.

Nowadays machines have become more sophisticated due to which more and more jobs and tasks which involve high physical work are being done by machines. What do you think this development has negative or positive effects.,"In these days, machines seem to become more sophisticated by leading an increase in works and assignments, which include high physical work, are being done by automated machines. 

To start with, one implication of the challenge could be pointed out as following remarkable shifts in technology tendencies, the circumstances in which automated machines do specific manual jobs of workers seems to have become more widespread. It considerably increases the free time of workers, so they can have more attention to their private lives. Since the majority of machines in Alaman company have automated, the work time spent by workers in the office is considerably decreased, and as a result, they have more space in life for their family and friends. Thus, hardly anybody can refuse to accept that it is exceptionally challenging to underestimate this.

However, some experts who believe that automated machines have increased the rate of unemployment could consider the situation worrisome. Highlighting the argument, it could be said that the implementation of advanced machines have decreased the amount of manual work, and as a consequence, the rate of job seekers has risen. It has a detrimental effect on the economy of a country. If the government did not act soon, the unemployment rate would cause poverty and economic collapse. Nevertheless, it is essential to weigh all the facets of every particular situation. 

To sum up, the latter judgement is more convincing, since this is backed up by my own experience, for I am an ex-worker who experienced layoff due to the implementation of machines.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging the environment so it must be stopped. Discuss both views and give your opinion","While few individuals have arguably put forward the statement that economic broadening is the only solution to put a halt to hunger and penury. Although, another group suggest that this growth will have a negative impact on the environment. The following essay will decipher both the viewpoints of this argument and outline my opinion.

On one hand, A country's gross domestic product (GDP), since it is linked with the economic widening, if improved, can lead to a decline in famine and poverty. Although a lot of factors contribute to the economic success of a country for example, if a person gets a quality education, it will lead to the self-advancement of that individual which in turn can be aligned towards the developing the economy by creating value through productivity like manufacturing and sale goods, services, etc. As a result ,this  will lead to a better standard of living for an individual and increased purchasing power which in turn saves he/her from sufferings like poverty.

On the other Flank, adverse effects can be reflected by economic development. for instance, in a recent ,study it was highlighted that due to increased purchasing power and living, a vast majority of people have occupied a lot of land, food, etc. which in turn creates a depletion of resources.furthermore because of the rapid growth, companies that have shared this growth have started deteriorating  nature through the release of harmful gases and pollutants from big industrial factories. this all makes the government officials as well the general public  rethink  the economic widening.

Having discussed the dichotomy, what I opine is that economic development is essential. As if an economy improves a lot of suffering can be mitigated. Although there are few worse effects that give a  bad reputation for this growth,  still it leads a country towards innovation.

To sum up, it can be rightly reiterated that economic growth is vital even though the demerits of this exist it should be considered equally and improving the lives of individuals will lead to prosperity and happiness instead of starvation.","## Task Achievement:

Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is argued that technological advancements in the field of conversation have adversely affected one's personal and professional relationships. Personally, I strongly disagree with this view.

As new ways of communicating with one another, such as mobile phones and social networks, are introduced, some fear that people might become socially isolated. Their rationale is that these technologies, which promote communication in virtual reality, have marginalized physical interaction and thus may potentially fracture concrete relationships. However, this claim is largely exaggerated. In reality, virtual interaction augments social relationships rather than undermines them. For example, most Facebook users talk to friends and colleagues both through the social network and in person. The extra features that Facebook provides like instant messaging and video calling do not substitute for having a conversation in real life, but merely help us stay connected over long distances.

I am convinced there is further evidence to suggest that innovations in communication exist not to the detriment of social relationships, but rather to their benefit. Not only do they address the question of distance as demonstrated above, these tools also help us to expand our social circles. For instance, online food forums connect people who share a passion for culinary arts, while photo-sharing applications like Instalgram can bring together a group of individuals who have the same taste in fashion. These examples are a testament to how technology establishes communities and promotes interaction among people.

In conclusion, there are sufficient grounds to reject the view that social relationships might be jeopardized by the advent of advanced communication technologies. It is my genuine belief that as technology improves going forward, so will people's social experience.","### Task Achievement:

"Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","A debate over the importance of social skills and academic skills of job applicants are long been a subject of discussion. Some employers in the organisation prefer social skills while some prefer academic skills. Both skills are important to work in an organzation but in my opinion, social skills are most useful in an organisation.

To begin with, academic skills are nowadays limited to books and theories whereas social skills make a person better in their life. Organisations in today's world work in the shape of projects where the social skills of their employees are needed. For instance, projects are done with teams, where everyone have to carry their team. Secondly, they have to meet their clients and present the ideas which can be done if a person has social skills otherwise, the clients will not be impressed.

Furthermore, academics are also very important aspect of life. When a person has rich knowledge about their field then they can better perform in an organisation. For example, there are certain jobs like accountant job where academics are much needed. If a person has enough knowledge about the standards of accounting and can perform their duty properly but can not socialize in an organization then they may get success professionally but will lack to create networks and bonds with other employees.

In conclusion, both skills have their own importance but the weightage of social skills are a bit more than academic skills. The best ways to be successful is to use both the skills at the same point. Those will be succeeded who has academics to perform well and has the social skills to express themselves in a better and creative way.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that technology makes life complex, so we should make our life simpler without using technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In today’s world, it is believed by a part of the population that the complexity that technology brings is unnecessary and we should simplify our life by getting rid of them. This essay disagrees with this claim because technology has brought us convenience more than anything else and it is impossible to imagine our life without them.

100 years ago, life was indeed so much simpler than today. However, without the help of technology; transportation, communication, and many more services were extremely poor and hard to access. So no one can deny that technology has revolutionized all those basic aspects; now we can travel to the other side of the world with just a few hours, see and talk to each other with just a few clicks. It is true that technology can somewhat turn our life just a bit more complicated, although in the end, it also makes our daily basics simpler yet much more efficient than ever before.

Moreover, life without wonderful machinery no doubt is challenging as human has already got familiar with using them every single day. If we wipe out everyday object like smartphone, laptop, car, and bullet train, the economy would collasp within a few days due to the fact that a huge number of jobs are currently relying on those machine.

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In recent years, the concept of the phenomenon has become widespread, referring to people who have become famous for their lifestyle. Sometimes the youth try to pretend to be like them. To my mind, it may have several negative consequences.

It is a simple supply-demand pattern, in which they try to provide the audience with something more required. Unfortunately, youngsters prefer glamorous celebrities instead of talented ones. Those who come to the agenda with their scandalous and rich lives are in the spotlight. For example, the Kardashian family has not any specific achievements; however, for a showy lifestyle, they have a huge following. They make unnecessary expenses and take part in meaningless events. This could be a bad example for teenagers who take them as role models. When the life they want is not offered, they can become depressed and, worse, rebel against their families or can behave inappropriately. 

In fact, some celebrities are often found in smoking advertisements, charged with drugs and other criminal activities. A young person who chooses this kind of famous person as an idol will be able to damage their health. Another example can be the impact of a particular celebrity's bad roles in films or series. For instance, Sanjay Dutt, Bollywood Actor is well known for his money and roles as a villain, his terrorist acts in different movies have given rise to violence and crime in the streets of Mumbai, all these were committed by adolescents for thrill and adventure.

In brief, because of the information age, children and adolescents are informed by watching TV, using social networks, and can follow celebrities on these platforms as their role models.

Many people believe that the current system of both teachers and students in the classroom will no longer exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree with this opinion?,"Education plays a vital role in the life of students as well as teachers. A recent rise in the online learning has resulted in a system where the dynamics of student's and teacher's working are drastically changed. This essay will discuss these changing trends between the two with the evolution of technology.

In recent times, people prefer to study online. With the advancement in technology many people are opting for online studies rather than going to classrooms, since it is more effective and convenient.  For instance, they can simply login to websites and study without leaving their homes and to understand the topic better they can repeat the lectures on the laptop. A recent study has shown that online learning is nearly 20 percentage more effective than attending classrooms.

Although there are many aspects in which the online learning precedes the classrooms, there are some aspects of on campus studying that can never be replaced by online studies. Firstly, some subjects requires performing practical examinations, which can never be done via internet. To exemplify, subjects in science, namely, physics and chemistry require students to perform experiments in labs. Secondly, some subjects require people's interactions as a part of the subject which cannot be achieved through online education. For instance, subjects such as mass communication require students to interact with people in person.

"Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","In today's world, People have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others. In my view, modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past.

There are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more dependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without ,help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.

However, I would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our hometowns. For example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world.

In conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now depend on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever.","## Task Achievement:

"Some believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves.

Do you agree or disagree?","some people contend that it should be a law for younger individuals to take the responsibility of taking care of their own older members in their twilight years when they have disabilities in terms of physical, mental and financial. I completely disagree with this notion. This essay puts this notion into debate and assesses its aspects.

It is undeniable that many offspring are not the best choice for taking care of the older generation. In other words, some individuals are not aware of their supporting duties, in consequence, they could cause a lot of problems in the process of caring. For example, supporting an old person in terms of physically and mentally is a daunting task and it needs people who are professionals in these fields such as doctors, nurses, and therapists to support and enhance the level of the old people's lifestyle. Hence, this approach as a law would not work efficiently and may cause many issues for both young members and old individuals. 

In addition, some people contend to participate with younger family members when older members of their family have financial inabilities. However, due to low salaries and cost of living, some family members are unable to have big investments to look after their old members in case of emergency. For instance, having a cooperative program between authorities and professionals with sufficient knowledge would make it much easier for the country in place of demand help from young members, provide residential areas for supporting older generations in many terms and support them financially. Thus, the responsibility of young members as law would not help older people to tackle problems of their disabilities in their twilight years.

"More people decide to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?
Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","With the progression of the society, many people do their family planning in their thirties rather than twenties which was common a decade ago. This essay will discuss positives and drawbacks of this trend and which outweighs the other.

As people have turned extremely ambitious these days, they prefer achieving their goals and indulge into starting a family later. This priority shift not only help them focus and earn huge amount of money to make them self sufficient, but it also helps to financially support the future generation in a better way. For instance, financially independent parents are able to provide a better lifestyle for their children than those who are unstable in their careers.

On the contrary, ageing brings vulnerability of severe health issues in a person's life. By the same token, pregnancy becomes complicated at the later stage, both for a man and a woman. A recent research concluded that, the probability of conceiving in couples is reduced by 23% after they touch their thirties and can further be declined up to 53% over the age of thirty five. Secondly, individuals do not remain fit enough to support their children, if the age gap between the parents and child is big. For example, if a child is born when a man is forty five, his child would be only twenty and not financially independent at the man's retirement age. Hence, the family might need extra financial aids to support the children.

In conclusion, they are few advantages to starting a family late such as a child can be provided better financial aid to support his life, the disadvantages are more and it outweighs the advantages as the complications in conceiving can increase with a person's age and the generation gap between progenitors and their children is huge which can become a major issue in future.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a growing belief among some individuals that teenagers should be obliged to participate in unpaid community work during their leisure time. While this may have some advantages for both teenagers and the community, I believe that it should not be mandatory.

On the one hand, the proponents of mandatory community work argue that it can provide several benefits for teenagers. Firstly, it can help them develop a sense of responsibility and belonging towards their community. Secondly, it can expose them to various social issues and challenges, which can enhance their awareness and understanding of the world around them. Finally, it can provide them with opportunities to acquire new skills and experiences that may be beneficial for their personal and professional growth.

Furthermore, mandatory community work can also have several positive impacts on the community. For instance, it can address various local issues such as littering, environmental degradation, and poverty. Additionally, it can promote social cohesion and encourage people to work together towards common goals.

However, I believe that teenagers should not be compelled to do community work, as this may have some negative consequences. Firstly, it may lead to resentment and resistance among teenagers, who may view it as a form of forced labor. Secondly, it may undermine the voluntary spirit of community work, which is based on the principle of free will and altruism. Finally, it may divert teenagers' attention and time away from their studies, hobbies, and other interests, which are equally important for their development.

In conclusion, while mandatory community work may have some potential benefits for teenagers and the community, I believe that it should not be imposed on teenagers. Instead, they should be encouraged and motivated to participate in community work voluntarily, based on their interests and aspirations.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.","There has been a difference of opinion regarding the final purpose of museums, while some believe that these kinds of places should be only informational, I would argue that can be both entertaining and educational. 
On the one hand, museums naturally are historical places due to the quantity of cultural heritage contained. In this way, exhibitions showing ancient components and the remains may be a great way to learn about the history of different cultures. In fact, in most of the antique representations are shown aspects about the life and customs of our ancestors. Also, most people visit these institutions in order to receive a further knowledge. For example, the majority of museums include a guide who is in charge of the tour. This person, can even give response of any particular curiosity surged. 
On the other hand, it is an important factor of museums the role of being enjoyable. Such historical institutions are principal tourist attractions, foreign people often have limited time. Because of that, is relevant the development of special methods, which sum all the data in an attractive form. For example, in many countries they offer audio visual systems in order to turn the tour into more dynamic. The average visitor may become bored if they have to read a lot of educational content, especially school students or younger citizens. Because of that, the museum is designed to be visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities as part of its exhibitions. 
By way of conclusion, I believe that educational and enjoyable experience cannot be brought into comparison to see which is more relevant because they have complementary equal meaning to those historical points.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the recent creative era, there is need to upgrade artistic skills among the little ones. Fewer masses hold that the creative subjects are fruitful to uplift the creativity of the students, but others think that it is not useful. I firmly stand by the former viewpoint. In my piece of writing, I shall shed light on both points with my agreement.
First and foremost, the early age is period of talent development, if the academic institutions provide platform to toddlers to dig deep about art subjects , then the students come across various new and interesting things. Second, the drawing is a sole subject to read the mind of the learners, because with the help of colours the little ones describe mind image on paper . So, from my prospective, the children should shift their mind compass toward the creative tasks.
However, some human beings are in favour of limited academic subjects. There are numerous fields to teach the learners, with the introduction of art , the small ones consume much more time in playing instead and give dim preference to major subjects. To illustrate, the childhood is an age ,where  the learners only pay attention to the interesting subjects, while providing art in schools , the pampers start to explore about only moulding subject and forget about another important curriculum activities.

"Some people believe that time spent on television, video and computer games can be beneficial to children. Others believe this has negative effects on a child. 

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There is currently a contentious argument whether electronic devices are should be considered as a benefit to  youth or not. In this essay, I will examine both sides and then explain why I believe how these equipment are good for children's' development.

Admittedly, electronic devices can be detrimental. The main reason for that is because it can lead children to isolation. It is known that electronic devices can turn children addicted to it since because it provides a delightful satisfaction. Therefore, if parents do not nourish their children and discipline them they will not be able to tighten relationships with real friends which can be harmful in the future. For example, children tend to leave school and run home in order to enjoy playing at home instead of play with real colleagues at school and this behaviour can be extended to adult life.

Although the reason aforementioned, electronic devices can far bring benefits to children. Mainly, these equipment help youngers in develop their focus. Mainly, when they are coping with electronics such as videos, games and suchlike they already have disconnected from the world and get concentration only to these devices while relaxing at the same time. For instance, when people are watching movies or spending some time in front of a computer they are relaxing due to the fact that they are able to forget about life problems when paying attention these activities; thus, they are increasing their focus.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Some families have their own houses while some others rent them. However, living somewhere whether it’s a house or an apartment is a vital question and in several countries, the number of people who are keen on finding out about the history of their residence increases because of the aura the houses carry in themselves.

 All places have their unique specifics due to the humans who reside there. Because people who inhabit somewhere always leave their energy and vibes.

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To What extent do you agree or disagree?","The current generation of famous personalities are known more for their attractive lifestyle and less for hardwork which I believe is misleading the youngsters. I will explain in this essay how the focus on extravagant lifestyle of a celebrity instead of focusing on their work can leave a wrong impression on the youth.

 Firstly, the living style adapted by the well known people sets unrealistic goals and standards for an average person. Moreover, the importance is given to the looks and style of clothes rather than the succesful art which also results in people spending unnecessary money on expensive beauty and health products. The youngsters try to look like these stars by using overpriced materialistic things and hence, loose their focus on studies and their career. There are multiple online websites that sells the exact clothes used by the celebrities with an astonishing price range. With such standards a young person gets influenced easily and lead a misguided life.

 Secondly, the overshow of the luxurious way of life of a famous personality leads the people to beleive that the hardwork is the least imprortant part of their success. Their talent and artistic work is overshadowed by their media presence. As we all know, the social media has been an intimate medium to get an access to a celebrities life which is mostly deceiving. Although, the purpose of these stars is to motivate people but they end up leaving a bad example of putting the glam above the job.

In conclusion, I fully agree that by putting the excess expenditure of money and a luxurious lifestyle as the centre of attention, the famous people are misguiding our present youth.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that competitive sports have positive effects on teenager education, while others argue that effect is negative.  Discuss both view and give your opinion.","Nobody would dispute the fact that all teenagers need to have a healthy life by doing sports.But some people think that youngsters should not play competitive game because it can harm them.While others think that competitive sport such as football has a positive effect on children.I reckon that all teenagers should do sports and sometimes they can play competitively.In this essay,I will discuss both opinions and give a relevant opinion.

On the one hand,I believe that such sport as football or basketball have a lot of advantages.To be honest, it can be really hard to play in the team and you can have a misconception about your team players.But if you learn how to work in a group and have  good communication and mutual understanding skills it might help you in future.I reckon that people will use these skills in their future work.For example, ,usually employees need to do projects in big groups.Moreover, rival games can be more entertaining and more interesting than playing alone.

On the other hand, rival game have a negative effect on children.Generally, competitive games end with anger from the ones who loses which can lead to fighting.In my childhood, I used to cry after I lost the game and it could somehow affect my nervous system because after playing I always was embarrassed and stressed.

And then, if museums only give visitors the dull data, such as figures, texts and the others to introduce these exhibits, people will become tired and bored quickly. As a result, they may not be interested in museums any more. That is why currently some museums provide some enjoyable facilities such as toys, VR glasses and 3D movies to improve museums' entertaining in order to increase their attraction. 

On the other hand, some people think that museums should be a place where visitors learn knowledge. Generally, the data that is given by museums about the exhibits is accurate and objective, so it is easy for guests to get information from through these exhibits and the information is reliable. A good example of this is that foreign tourists who want to study or to understand the local knowledge about history, culture and technology usually go to the national museum. Therefore, the educational role of museums should not be ignored.   

In conclusion, there are convincing arguments about the museums' functionality. In my view, museums should be both enjoyable and educational.","**Task Achievement:**

"Money offered for post graduate research is limited; as a consequence, some people argue that financial support from the government should only be provided for scientific research rather than research for less useful subjects. Do you agree or disagree?","Financial support is one of the important needs for graduates and postgraduates in other to fulfil their research. However, some people claim that the government should only financially support  scientific research rather than other subjects . In my ,opinion I totally  agree with the statement because science contributes to the evolution of the world . 

To begin, the science industry requires a lot of attention and financial support because they are the most important cooperation in the world .Furthermore, they contribute to the survival of species and the well being of humans as well as animals . For instance , in the year ,2020 the whole world faced the COVID-19 pandemic which had an impact on the nation. Each country,especially  Europe had to financially support the scientist to supply a vaccine. This actually helps them to provide us in this year 2021 with a different type of  vaccine that is helping the community to fight against the virus.

In addition, investing in postgraduate scientists is supporting the medical and technology research department for a better and easier future way of life . This is the best way for the government to improve the science industries to fight against future problems and also upgrade our life . For example, our way of communicating has been boosted for the past 10 years with the support of science. We can be connected at all times, working from a long distance and also been in touch with one family at every moment of the day . Thus , it is much easier to communicate and facilitate our conversation.

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","Art has become increasingly popular across many countries.Some people believe that it is an important subject for students at school while others believe it is not. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in detail and provide my opinion.

On the one hand, many people think that art is a crucial course at schools  for various reasons.Although it is an extra effort apart from regular courses, individuals believe the future is bright for the employees in these fields since the salaries are high.For example, citizens who are good at theatre arts can get an opportunity to work in Hollywood films where the remunerations are high. Secondly, people specialized in certain artwork will become familiar personalities in the world.This will bring them huge name and fame which will remain even they are not alive.For instance,  famous books such as Shakesphere novels will remain in people's heart forever.

On the other side, some people think that art is a waste of time which is spoiling student's future.Despite there are few people who are successful in many arts, the ratio is relatively very less. To illustrate, though photography is a creative skill, very few people will become successful.Moreover, students believed in particular art and ignored their academics will regret that they have wasted a lot of time if they are unsuccessful.To give a clear example, pupils who ignored studies and concentrated only in skills will become unemployed since the success rate is very low in these creative skills.

"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education, so that they can at least read, write and use numbers.


To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that primary schooling should be complimentary in underdeveloped nations to make the children able for writing, reading and basic mathematics. This essay agrees with this statement because this is not only an initiative to bring impoverished kids into school but would also improve the literacy rate of the underdeveloped nations in long run.

To embark on, majority of people in developing countries cannot reach to the door of schools because they don’t have enough resources and capital to afford it. This decision of free schooling up to six years would encourage them to learn fundamental skills and knowledge. Consequently, people can use that basic education such as simple calculations, language writing to find out job opportunities for the survival of their family. Besides this, educational administrators should consider providing complimentary bags and one meal to reduce the extra burden on pupils. For instance, Indian government has been providing mid day meal in schools since 1995 irrespective of any caste, creed or religion. This policy has brought millions of poor children into public educational institutions. Hence, this scheme could motivate the humankind to take the advantage of educational resources which can direct them to job market.
Additionally, this proposal could turn into a great investment in escalating the level of literacy rate. To elucidate, many people in the third- world economies have been struggling to obtain livelihood and would never think to go in the school. This policy could provide a great opportunity to influence everyone for starting up a new life. Furthermore, the likelihood of continuing studies after six years would be more because many students will develop their interest and thinking to pursue higher education and enter job market. According to the article of India news, the illiteracy index has been reduced to 20% as compared to 44 % in India, after the introduction of free education program. It proves that complimentary primary schooling has raised the level of education which further open the new gate of jobs for literate individuals.

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the modern society, it is encouraged that young people should develop the enterprenership mindset and building up their own enterprises. It is clear to me that the more money the bussiness makes the more responsibilities to the society it should contribute to. 

Firstly, it is absolutely no deny that businesses play a very important role in creating jobs for man. For example, Vinamilk is one of the largest food producers in Vietnam. They currently employ around 10 000 workers throughout Vietnam, according to their annual report. We can imagine that what might be happening if this giant company bankcrupt? Thousands of workers will be potentially loosing their job. This might impact markedly in the social balancing and the social sercurity as unemployment will rise up.

Secondly, large organizations are capable to use their manpower to provide social facilities in a bigger scale. For instance, during the last two years of Covid, Vingroup,in accompanied with Chairman Mr. Vuong and his wife had been donated nearly 9000 billions VND to help our government and Vietnamese people to fight with the coronavirus. This unbelievable distribution help to save many people lives and children. Without this generous co-operation and these individuals, it is hard for our government to do such things fastly and precisely as they was shown to the public in the last period of time.

In conclusion, universal is operated in a circle. As it is written in one of favourite quote that “the more you give out, the more you get back”. The more the bussiness contribute back to people, to the society, to help them to archive the desirable goals, the more successful the bussiness can get as it will be paid back by people who were helped by them.

"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in newspapers and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Numerous characters deem watching TV and reading magazines as a wastage of time, as there is no correlation to citizens' lives; meanwhile, certain groups of people oppose and affirm many necessary pieces of information get announced by the news program. I reckon we should not glean a public's daily news from the press, TV, broadcast, and other media. 

First of all, it got proved that affluent people and wealthy politicians give a bribe to media and TV channels to deceive the population for various reasons. If one of the parliament members offends some major crimes, he or she can conceal the offence by using the power of media deluding people, which is a classical way how the press earns. There are countless incidences relating to this in Mongolia. One of these is Tuvshin, a member of parliament congress, who hid successfully the fact that he raped a girl, and stole a large amount of money from the government thanks to the media, which is one example. Hence, it is crucial to do not believe news reported by media.

Secondly, insofar as the objective of the press and webs is to captivate as many readers as possible so that they can make more money. Many websites are posting many numbers of intriguing news, gossips, and other juicy info through the internet and social media every day. For example, you can observe that there are many trashy but juicy posts on Facebook uploaded by websites. Therefore, we have to react perceptively to these uncertain pieces of information.

Parents should encourage children to spend less time studying and more time doing physical activities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Over the past few years,the issue of children's free time has been widely debated. However, some parents think children should spend more time on academics because that is very important for their future.In my opinion, outdoor activities are more crucial to them as I will discuss both sides in the following essay.

There is no doubt that studying in lectures is important, because that is one of the basic responsibilities of students. For example, in Taiwan,there is an obligate education policy which means it is compulsory for citizens to abide for 12 years of education from elementary school to high school. Moreover,Some students have to go to cram school after class ,this can put a high pressure on students for their study performance. Furthermore,learning knowledge and skills is vital at a young age,because education can be a factor in future development,and is highly correlated with future success in the eyes of some parents.

On the other hand,some parents think exercise is always the priority for their children,due to teenagers growing up very fast in this time period,it is called a” golden time”. After this period, it becomes challenging to influence the physical growth of children,that is the reason why parents should put more emphasis on their health.This includes nutrition, body flexibility, and mental well-being, especially since children may not cope well with excessive academic pressure.

In conclusion,studying hard in academics and doing outdoor activities are two essential factors and should not be ignored when children are growing up,provided parents can give more balance on both sides, it could be beneficial to their children.","## Task Achievement:

Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"the issue of whether the popularity of marketing for products nowadays and this effect on the development have been raising a lot of debates. Some might say that the advertisements have a beneficial effect on the individual and the industries such as open people’s knowledge about the goods, increase the profit of the companies through buying their products to customers. On the contrary, others insist on the opinion that false advertising can have a damaging effect on a human’s health. Viewing from a general perspective, I personally agree with the former opinion for the following reasons.

To begin with, today, in the development of facilities and the internet, advertising has become close to citizens and determine to the decision to buy something for the customer depends on the attraction of videos that introduce the products to the public, then it will bring a benefit to both people and companies. Firstly, inhabitants can substantially broaden their horizon by watching or reading the advertisement on the television or newspaper and they will know clearly about functions, advantages or disadvantages of the goods that they are going to buy, it will help them to make a perfect choice for themself. For example, people who want to buy a new wash hair do not know which benefit for their hair, thanks to the introduction of the products about purpose in the social media or tv the customer will find the one which is suitable for them.   Secondly, the companies who make the marketing will receive profit from selling the goods by approaching consumers better through advertising. For instance, giving the new item to the public by using the interaction with customers through advertising on Facebook or Youtube,the detail of the goods attract the intention of people that leads to them decide to buy this. Finally, introducing the goods by marketing

on the other hand, some of the population think that some of the companies have the advertisement is not the truth about the function of the item and this has a detrimental effect on the health of the human when they buy low-quality products, besides a lot of video or picture of marketing for the goods in the network make citizens feel inconvenient. However, advertising brings to people a diversity of products and they can make a better decision.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.


What are the reasons for this?


How can people research this?","In a few countries, an increasing number of individuals are getting fascinated to discover the past of the dwelling or property they reside in. This essay will discuss the curious nature of the current generation and the need for a sense of connection as the cause, followed by how families living for generations can help in providing information.

One of the reasons that are contributing towards this is the intriguing nature of human beings born in the late nineties. Many of them are aware that the premises they are now resident to must have had a beginning which is now refurbished and renovated. As a result, this triggers the brain to know more about what was the thought process that lead to the construction of this structure at this specific location. For example, in 2020 a survey conducted by Realtor.com displayed that 80 per cent of youngsters before renovating the building they reside in would research the initial idea behind it because they did not want to damage the sentiments attached to that habitation.

Another reason is that to feel at home, individuals seek a sense of connection. Usually, a structure is made from concrete, steel, wood and other forms of raw material. There is not an instant attachment to any property one would move in along with their family. Therefore, to convert a house into a warm permanent abode, individuals look for reasons to find feelings in order to settle down for their entire lives and build legacies there. For example, in 2015 research published by the psychology department of the University of The Punjab 50 per cent of those who bought a new property would search for the history of the building in order to find a feeling of belonging.

Out of the many approaches, one that is most common is meeting the elderly in the neighbouring houses, as they have seen the area built, the surroundings change around them and the tenants moving in and out of these dwellings. This is why they have the most information about the place and can be the most authentic source of data. For example, in 2017 an article published by The Newyork Times showed that 68 per cent of the intriguing stories were uncovered about New York by talking to the senior members of the society.

In conclusion, curiosity and a desire to seek a connection are two possible reasons why people investigate the history of their homes and in order to do so, elder members of society are the best peoples to reach out to.","## Task Achievement:

"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.

You should write at least 250 words.","Nowadays, most people consider that the pupils need to some subjective science topic so that they should learn it and they have to pass their exam. The school only provide to this experience that's why if they want acquire some talent such as cooking, dressmaking or art subject then they should learn from their parent or relatives. However, on the other hand some people think about this sitiation is not correct because school should be educational roof and tutors must teach about nut only science topics but also they should teach some skills how can they do. This essay sugggests that the second view is closest to the truth but other side is not to be ignored. The discussion follows below.

First and foremost, many pupils have been studying in school for five years, sometimes their parents working and many times their mother and father can not find a enough time for rasing their child. Furthermore, These children can not learn about some skills from their parents and they do not have any opportunities than this school. The individual who dont know any skills or basic life requirement such as cooking, houseworking or dressmaking they wouldn't be qualified in the future life. For instance, according to an American psychologist, the someone who can not earn some simple life experience they do not exactly succeed in any area. 

Secondly, many people want to academic success and passing examinations and they claim that it can be if teachers teach about only this topics. Lots of the people exert the greatest motivation to children's growth and they send their children to prospering school. Additionally, this parents believe that the schools should focus on science,  quality and quantity topics, they consider if they want to some skills for their children then they can enroll the pupils in art or lifelong education centre.

"Some people claim that many things that children are taught at school are a waste of time. Other people argue that everything that children study at school is useful at sometime. 
Discuss the both views and give your opinion.","Many Proponents believe that these days, educational institutes are wasting the precious time of a child by teaching unnecessary things, whereas, others believe that everything taught by teachers in schools is crucial for the child's development and will be useful in the future. I believe that every subject is important, and will benefit the children one way or another.

To commence with, the advocaters of the former viewpoint believe that the school curriculum is overloaded with a number of different subjects as some of them are just worthless and a waste of time. They ultimately adding an extra burden on the learners to cover all these subjects in a limited time frame and sometimes a child is not interested in that specific subject. For instance, arts and craft is a mandatory subject in secondary education and sometimes it is not suitable for all the children, because some students do not have any interest to learn paintings. Thus, these subjects are a wastage of resources.

Conversely, I believe that education is always worthwhile because there are various life-long lessons taught by teachers in the schools which are beneficial for a child's overall development. Besides, they could be transferred to the workplace, and there everyday life as past knowledge can be applied to a new situation, so all knowledge is vital no matter how significant it might be.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that as with being profitable, enterprises are able to take responsibility for society. I completely agree with this belief by the formidable positive impact on socioeconomic can be made.

On the one hand, it is true that the main purpose of companies is to make money in order to survive in a competitive world. Facing unpaid bills, investment fees, employees’ salaries, etc leading to making money is the first choice. However, in fact, they are not only implementing the common function but also responding to the responsibilities that can be included in earning money.

Discuss both views and give our opinion.,"Scientists believe that the earth will become uninhabitable by 2050 due to the extensive damage being done to the environment by humans. While many people believe that the fate of the earth is doomed, others are of the opinion that there are still chances of reviving it, if preventive measures are taken. In this essay, I will delve into both views and provide my support for the latter view.

It is undeniably true that humans have gone too far in exploiting earth’s natural resources and many believe that it is futile to even try to save it. I believe the main reason for this thought is our inherent selfish nature. Many people would rather live comfortably utilizing all resources rather than worry about the future generation. Therefore, it is quite evident that people are not ready to come out of their comfort-zone, despite knowing that they are destroying the earth.

On the other hand, it is never too late to take steps to protect our planet from further damage. This is because there are numerous initiatives and organizations already in place waiting to get the necessary support and funds from the government and common citizens. This could be achieved by taking small steps such as placing billboards on the busiest traffic intersections or posting relevant energy conservation tips on the social media. Since a majority of the population uses the subways for their daily commute, posters could be pasted on the subway walls as well. Obviously, we can do a lot if we stand united.

In conclusion, even though, it may seem like there is nothing we can do about the present state of our planet, it is never too late to take preventive measures. We have a collective responsibility to save this planet for our future generations","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think technology makes life complex, so we should make life simpler without using technology. Do you agree or disagree?","In recent centuries, the development of machinery has brought a lot of benefits for us. Some people think that machinery is very significant. While some argue it has been plenty of negative for humans. In my opinion, I only can agree partly with the issues and this essay will explore more about the above problems.

First, we will discuss the negative. There are so many reasons to talk about what affects people when we use them. Standing in the person’s perspective who witnessed tragedies when their offspring got game addicted person, which leads to plenty of problems about the development of children. In addition, they can’t control their behaviours, and cause some crimes in society if they do not receive care from adults. For instance, a multitude of adults do not spend time with their children which leads to addiction syndromes in their offspring, and they are bad people and aren’t helpful to the community. 

On the other hand, we will talk about the positives when we depend on it. Standing in the person’s perspective who knows how to use technology the right way. In fact, a lot of parenthoods who allow their offspring to research information on the Internet but they have a control so strict with their offspring. This can be seen, in a multitude of children who have studying progress compared with their friends when they use machinery the right way. For example, when researching information at school, o lot of parents accept their offspring using technology sever for studying, which makes them progress more and more. 

In conclusion, using technology is positive or negative it depend on the perspective of each individual. Although it has some negative but besides it has so good.

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Issues related to the museum are frequently discussed these days. Although some people believe that museums introduce us to have enjoyable moments with others rather than learning occasion, others criticize and argue that museums aim is to become an educational tool. Both sides of the view will be shown in this essay.

On the one hand, there are several reasons why museums should be joyful places. The principal reason is that the performances in the gallery have often shown both creative and aesthetic things influencing people to feel clam down; such as landscape painting. To explain, many forms of art; such as music can be a great tool to decrease stress problems. Thus; museum should be one of the places where offer joyful date for some society suffered from work. 

For instance, many families opt to take their families time for relaxing in the exhibition in the children museum.

On the other hand, there are a number of causes why the most beneficial goal of the museum is to educate the community. The main reason is that most of the exhibitions in the museums usually deliver some messages to trigger human’s notions or at least allows people to think of their meanings even though they do not know the artists. A good example in this point is that there are different meanings of sculptures between people when they are walking around them.

Another point is that apart from places were share the happy moments, visiting the gallery has a positive impact on learning skills in order to encourage students to interest their lessons. For example, many students enjoy listening the historical events while they are walking around the historical library and observing real matters rather than reading books.

All things considered, I am of the opinion that although the museums contribute to both enjoyable moments and educational sectors thanks to various sorts of museums, the benefits of educational terms slightly outweigh than other reasons.

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extend do you agree or disagree?","It is apparent that business entities benefit the most in light of the era of industrialization. Therefore, compelling notion that great profits are synonymous with many substantial roles, which they have to play in the society, is raised.

When it comes to social responsibility of businesses, perhaps the major contribution of each entity is their financial obligation to the government tax revenue. In other words, transparency in tax declaration and fulfilling tax responsibilities is not only surge national economic prosperity but also increase public welfare and subsidizes aiming at workers such as healthy insurance, maternity insurance, unemployment insurance.

Alternatively stated, if a company use a proportion of their income into many social-benefit programs and go a long way towards manifesting their business ethic and social responsibilities, the company tend to draw more attention from consumers as well as arouse considerable public sympathy. Besides CSR, which usually costs colossal time and money, social duties can be done successfully within their own enterprise.

Given the win-win relationships between employees and employers as well as the unshaken importance of staff members as the primary force behind every fruition, I am convinced that they must therefore be treated well in terms of finance and living aspects.

Do the benefits outweigh the minus.
This essay illustrate that, the pros include speed and benefit, and the cons are the deprivation of live communication

First and foremost, the biggest benefit of social media is that it has shortened distances from hours to seconds. When there was no online environment people relied on phone calls or emails to communicate, and they frequently had to wait months or even years to see family members who were living away from home. However, with the introduction of various options like Facebook and Twitter, this has decreased the amount of time it takes to connect. Second, for politicians who blog, social networks have emerged as the most successful channel for reaching a large audience and, of course a good PR company.

In the following paragraph, we'll discuss how today's youth form friendships. The majority of children today only have online friendships, which makes it difficult for them to communicate in real time or express their emotions. Also on the Internet  teenagers feel their impunity and permissiveness because of this. There have been many cases of suicide due to cyberbullying of so-called haters

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There has been a difference of opinion regarding the merits of continuing a higher education as people believe that is better to get a job straight after school. I would argue that are more benefits in going to college or university. 
The option to start a work immediately is attractive for several reasons. The access to have an independent lifestyle as long as younger people start earning money, a wider range of possibilities come with it. In this way, they will be able to afford their own apartment or start a new family. In terms of their career, getting a job brings the opportunity to gain experience in specific fields. Indeed, spend time working in a real industry and sharing different points of views with co-workers and bosses, gives an invaluable knowledge about the process.  
Despite the arguments mentioned above, I believe that is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in the majority of professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having a degree. As a result, nowadays a large number of industries and hospitals are only hiring people who have a bachelor degree or higher. Secondly, in recent years, the job market is becoming more competitive and sometimes there are hundred of applicants for one position in a company. Subsequently, young people who do not have a degree will not be able to compete and without a job is more difficult to continue growing in a career.

"Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree? 

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

You should write at least 250 words.","In recent times, it is popularly noticed that social skills are becoming very valuable. In some industries, the recruiters feel that the interpersonal competencies of most job seekers have more value than their academic qualifications. I moderately agree with this opinion. This essay will discuss the reasons for my point of view.

To begin with, it is important to note that communication is an integral part of every work environment. Apart from interacting with clients, an employee needs to demonstrate social competency when relating with their colleagues to foster a healthy work space which in turn breeds organisation success. For instance, in my place of work, I have noticed that there is increased productivity when we work as a team with little to no conflict. However, in cases when there is a disagreement, there is less efficiency in achieving a task. This proves that good communication which results from good social skills promotes productiveness in every business establishment.

On the other hand, the educational accomplishments of an individual seeking a job are equally essential. This is because most professional jobs require a certain amount of skills and knowledge that is acquired through learning. To illustrate, only individuals that have received academic training as a nurse or a medical doctor should be allowed to carry out medical treatments and procedures for ailing individuals. Anything otherwise would result in hazards or loss of life whether the employee has good interpersonal skills or not.

To sum it up, this essay has explained why social skills as well as academic eligibility should equally be considered by employers when they decide to hire for a role. I hereby recommend that organisations should arrange training or workshops on good communication among their staff members.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","Many citizens today are keen to learn as much as possible about the homes they live in. This is because they want to understand their houses' history and design, evaluate their safety, and determine if they are haunted. I think that nearby seniors and the internet can be valuable sources of information for those who are curious about their homes.

Knowing a home's background gives people a sense of pride and satisfaction. This is why people who live in an old house are often interested in learning more about adobe. The history often includes the construction process, which was done by hand in a time before advanced technology. This exploration reveals unique and fascinating facts. For instance, some residents in our city's old district mistakenly believed their houses were built during the English colonial era. 

Actually, researchers have recently discovered that these houses were constructed to resemble English styles, but by the local masons. It was intriguing to learn this. In addition, the way a house is built and its quality provide significant knowledge about the safety and durability of the structure. Recognising such details could prevent individuals from experiencing catastrophic events such as the collapse of a house. Finally, some people believe that a house may be haunted if it has a dark past. Learning about a house's history often stems from personal beliefs and motives to either clean or vacate it. 

To conclude, in order to obtain accurate information, individuals can speak to senior citizens who have resided there for a significant period. They may provide firsthand insights about the property and other details not found elsewhere. Additionally, the internet can be a useful source of information about a house. Numerous websites contain data on properties in the area.","**Task Achievement:**

For instance, volunteer to visit the shut-ins and people in needs can help teens to have a grasp of the life of them.  As the youngster is highly impressionable, working for the neighbourhood will turn them into socially responsible adults. So, for the benefit of the district and youth, teenagers must be encouraged to occupy themselves with  voluntary jobs in their free time.

However, children between thirteen and nineteen years of age are fragile and through neighbourhood task, they have to dig deep into the harsh realities of life such as hunger and poverty. This could adversely affect their young conscience and they would be carrying the the negative image of society in their minds throughout their lives. Also, if the job is unpaid, there is a lack of motivation as well because if they are not paid for their efforts, they may get discouraged to participate in future. For example, many children are devastated when they interact with the deprived segment of the society and sometimes this leads to serious cognitive issues like depression and phobia of meeting new people. Therefore, it should not be mandatory for the juvenile to take part in unpaid social work in their free time.

To conclude, although unpaid public service is a noble act, youth should not be compelled to engage in it until they are ready because it exposes them to the harsh realities of life. Hence, volunteering should be a choice and not an obligation.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people think minors working an unpaid part-time job for communities might have advantages for themselves and for the local residents. I personally agree how part-time jobs for youngsters will bring many benefits for their future, because they will learn how to manage their time for work and play

The main reason they will benefit from part-time jobs is that they will have hands-on experience, thus increasing their hard and soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and teamwork. Many youngsters and recent graduates, for example, struggle to find work due to a lack of work experience. They will have an early start in learning how the work field operates as a result of this. Another one is that they can help communities that are in need and grow connections. Working with the community that surrounds them will not only benefit the community but also themselves, because helping people will give us our own satisfaction and contribute to the country, starting with a smaller scope.

On the other hand, many adults are concerned that, because of their part-time jobs, teenagers will have less time to play with their friends in their spare time. But most importantly, it’s not about how the part-time job would take their time, but how teenagers will learn to manage their time so they can work and also live their lives as teens. A lot of part-time jobs are usually open around the summer, so they can divide their time more easily now that the school term is over.

To conclude, I fully agree with how the unpaid part-time job will give more advantages to minors and the community, as long as they can balance their work and play time with friends.","## Task Achievement:

Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"There are controversial perspectives heating a debate over humans’ impact on nature. While some hold a strong view that actions have to be taken effectively, others argue that the issue is too late to be dealt with. Although each has its own perks, I would contend that there is still time for humankind to resolve this problem.

Undoubtedly, only after centuries of overexploitation did people realise nature has seriously been decimated, yet it is late to enhance the current situation. Since the dawn of civilization, a great number of species have ceased to exist due to humans’ activities . And when they become extinct, no matter how many efforts are made, there is no way people can bring these creatures back to life. Dodo birds can be cited as an obvious example as their extinction was directly linked to hunting. When Dodo birds were discovered by mankind, it took only approximately a century for these poor birds to be hunted to the last. That is why it is too late for some actions to be done in this day and age.

On the other hand, although the ecosystem has been destroyed severely, dwellers should join hands to make any possible efforts. As a wealth of fauna and flora are on the edge of extinction, authorities should create more preservation and ecosystem services to breed endangered species as well as protecting them from poaching. For example, the last White Rhino in North Africa has been under protection of the government for years. In fact, it is guarded day by day by soldiers in an isolated savanna. Therefore, dwellers are still capable of saving the wildlife from extinction, provided that dedicated actions of humans must be made.

All in all, I believe though many animals are facing extinction due to anthropogenic factors, we should still try to preserve biological diversity as well as possible in the long run.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think the money spent on developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It's a well-known fact that several governments allocate large sums of money towards space exploration. Personally, I strongly agree that these funds should be directed towards public services that have a more direct, immediate impact on people's daily lives.

There are several reasons why space exploration should be reconsidered. Firstly, such missions can be a tremendous expense, requiring vast amounts of money for astronaut training, rocket and space shuttle construction, and advanced technology development. Secondly, the exploration of space does not have a direct impact on the lives of ordinary citizens who struggle with challenges such as earning a livelihood and maintaining health. Lastly, space research can pose risks to astronauts' lives. Although unmanned spacecraft can minimize the involvement of human beings in dangerous tasks, accidents can still occur.

I firmly believe that the money spent on space research would be better allocated towards schools and hospitals. Firstly, it is more cost-effective to train teachers and doctors than astronauts. Dollars spent on education programs can equip young people with knowledge and skills that can improve their efficiency in the workplace, thereby improving their standard of living. Secondly, if governments opt to channel the funds previously used for space travel towards building hospitals and providing quality healthcare to citizens, people will feel safer and happier as they will receive support from national authorities.

In conclusion, I advocate for the reallocation of funds to areas of education and healthcare that have a more direct impact on people's lives, rather than expending vast amounts of money on exploring space and remote planets.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Art is a  beautiful creation.It is considered by some people that art should be a needed subject for students.However,others believe it is non-valuable.Before arriving at my position both  sides of the argument will be elaborated further.

       To begin with, discussing the first viewpoint,art can develop gross motor skills in children.To explain it, there are so many various types of art as well as tools such as a pencil, brush, and colours required by an art class.For ,student it is a real struggle while drawing to develop their muscle and hold, and use objects correctly. Art class teach children to hold the method of paintbrush,pencil, and marker, build their muscles while playing with paper.Moreover,art can generate  artists feeling.To explicate it, during drawing creator has to concentrate. and have an inside feeling.For example,in 2018,revealed by the world art system that 70% of artists regulate  their own minds' feelings such as their lives problem or happier movements in the drawing.

      On the other hand,also art subject has some drawbacks.Firstly, with the graduation of an art subject has low chances to get a higher salary job in future,a few artisartistsomes successful and famous among the public,only some creators get  higher money regarding their work.For example,the survey has found only 20 out of 100 art artists are famous as well as  higher salaries.The very famous artist Luis mark has 400 dollars per art.

"Some People believe that Robots play an important role in future societies, While other argue that robots might have negative effects on societies give often. discuss both views and give your opinion.","Being part of a world where technology has been changing how we live, some individuals defend that machines have a positive impact on our future. Although, there are those who state the opposite, believing that robots will bring an undesired outcome for our society. In my point of view, these technological tools are beneficial for us, as we can adapt them to our needs, which will make our lives easier. 

On the one hand, some people strongly believe that technological machines will improve our way of living, as it can help us with repetitive daily tasks. Nowadays we have seen hotels in Japan, for example, using robots to take dirty plates from the door of the rooms. Indeed, during times of pandemics, for instance, this is an amazing tool to protect clients as well as employees. Besides, it has been used to clean houses, as well, thus, when you finish working, you do not need to take care of it anymore. Furthermore, places that are facing a labour shortage can try to use it and still deliver the desired service. As we can see, these machines can solve some of our problems, making our life less stressful. 

On the other hand, this discussion brings a group of people that do not believe in the positive contribution of these robots. They defend that these machines can be used to replace humans, hence, reducing human interactions. A great example of this is the smartphones, as they are already negatively impacting on our sociability. In recent times, people are avoiding meet friends in person, staying always in touch using social media or video calls. Consequently, with smarter machines, this change will be bigger and can bring some health problems. Indeed, this is an important point to be taken into consideration, however, I believe that some measures need to be put in place to avoid it. 

In conclusion, the use of robots in our societies has been concerning part of the population who do not believe in its benefits, however, there are those who think that this is an important improvement in our lives. Even considering both sides, I still believe that there are ways to avoid the drawbacks of this technology and take advantage of its benefits, which for me are bigger than the negative impacts.","## Task Achievement:

Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"These days, there are more and more learners are inclined to have focus and attention difficulties during the class-hours. This is mainly because of the lack of interest to the subjects and also digital destruction. There are a number of solution that could be implemented to help them motivated.

Firstly, the foremost reason for the students are not actively involved or participating in the learning process, is due to the material uninteresting. In other words, the learners might find some lessons are boring and irrelevant to their live, which causing the struggle to stay engaged and focused.

For instance, rather than learning to memorize technical terms or definition, students can explore more or doing experimental studies in the laboratory or school garden.

"It is important for all the cities and towns to have large outdoor public spaces, such as parks or squares. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","There has been a controversy about the existence of large outdoor public spaces, such as parks or squares. Some say it's necessary to have these spaces in cities; some have the opposite opinions. I think having large outdoor public spaces is vital, and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs. 

First, parks can lessen our pressure. It's expected that due to technological development, we tend to have a heavier workload, and our working time is elongated; in other words, we may have to spend more time and energy on our jobs. Therefore, our living standards can be dampened, and it might stimulate the sales of tobacco and alcohol companies in order to release the pressure. At this point, the existence of parks can lessen our stress to a large extent; the smell and sound of plants and animals in parks exert a positive influence on our emotions. 

Second, expanding our social circles. It's commonplace that big events always take place in large outdoor public spaces, like squares. Hence, when a city has these spaces, which can provide good opportunities to meet new people and make new friends. For example, when a concert takes place in a square, it can attract its fans to come. In this case, you can find people who have the same interests as you in the concert; and as a result, you can extend your social circle. 

On the other hand, large outdoor public spaces have some disadvantages as well. For instance, they constantly require a large amount of space in cities. As we know,  to build large outdoor public spaces, the government has to draw an area exclusively for them; thus, such a situation can force the surrounding communities to move, and brings about housing insufficiency on account of these large outdoor public spaces. 

In conclusion, I believe the merits of public spaces outstrip their demerits.","## Task Achievement:

Films and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have negative effect on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Now-a-days, most of the movies and machine games containing violence are in demand. Few people thought that they have negative effects on society, while others say they are for mild relaxation. In the next few sentences, we discuss the views on both sides of the topic. In my opinion, the number of negative effects is higher compared to the other side.


Firstly, most of the machine games played by people contain violence because they are designed as per the survey people are playing. For example, today PUBG will be a game played by more than half of the world's population, while other games like puzzles are not as much popular. Even players are interested in games which includes firearms which leads to impact on society, as the person want to imitate the same in real life. When we go to the other side, films which have violence are popular compared to others. For example, one of the most popular pictures in India is Bahubali which has spread around the world where more than half of the picture time includes war scenes, whereas some other movies which has no violence/fights such as Midhunam is not popular here the movie describes how old people live their life's. Entertainment such as Movies and games has battles and wars which are throwing negative impact on society as some part of the people try to replicate them in real life.




On the other hand, few think that this is for entertainment and for relaxation, its true that most people feel relaxed when they win a game or when they like the film. By Recapitulating the examples in the second paragraph, a person plays PUBG for relaxation, he plays the game to win some badges and have a chicken dinner which helps him to release his stress levels by focusing on other information. When we come on to the movie part, People will feel relaxed when they have their specific interest as in present world most people are interested in violence, in particular people from south India expect fight scenes when they watch the picture.


To conclude, Films and machine games which have blood are popular as they have most of the negative impact on society, where people can go to malls or parks  for relaxation. Due to most of the negative consequences in society the films and machine games which have violance should be banned.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.
To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Scientific findings have clearly indicated that the excessive consumption of fast food is leading the health of people to deterioration. According to some people, this unhealthy practice can be stopped by means of education; however, some others have little faith in this solution. As the supporters of each view have their own justifications, whether education is effective remains to be seen in this essay.


 
On the one hand, raising the awareness of people towards the dangers of unhealthy food can certainly yield some promising outcomes. Firstly, many fast food products provide very little or no information on the nutritional content in them, deterring the consumers from knowing the amount of fat, sodium or cholesterol which they take in. By being informed of how much of these harmful substances is contained in their favourite hamburgers or chips, as well as being shown the likely consequences of over-eating these foods, consumers can be more cautious the next time they choose their food. Secondly, education at schools can help to form healthy eating habits for children and parents. For instance, schools can hold some extracurricular activities such as growing and selling vegetables with the attendance of both students and parents, in order to promote the benefits of healthy diets and warn against the potential risks of junk food.

On the other hand, some people doubt the effectiveness of education for certain reasons. To begin with, despite being aware of the negative effects of fast food, many people who are too busy persist to eat it due to its being convenient and time-saving. In this case, education hardly makes a difference as they have made a choice. In addition, compared with the wide range and availability of fast food stores and menus, healthy food is seriously limited. Furthermore, healthy food is commonly inferior to fast food in terms of taste and prices as a matter of fact. As a result, however convincing education is, it is almost impossible for people to change their eating habit without a ready alternative to their unhealthy food choices.

In conclusion, people have different opinions about whether to support education so as to reduce people’s consumption of fast food. In my opinion, education can be a viable measure with careful consideration of other impediments.","## Task Achievement:

Commencing with pre-eminent favourable aspects of bringing back the historical things. The former viable anatomy is, sentimental and emotional values are attached with the historical objects. Besides this, a nation's history and cultural values are associated with those objects, which were taken away by other people. To exemplify, Lord Visnu's idol had taken by the Britisher during the time of India's independence and kept in the museum of London. As a result, Indians think that idea place of that statue is it is own country rather than keeping it in another state. Owing to this they have put pressure on the ministry to accomplish this task.

Another point to consider is that these items can be used as a remedy to ameliorate as well as build the relationships between two countries.

By dint of this, the prime minister of France decided to return it back to normalise the relationships; Hence it resumes the bilateral talks between the two nations.

Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In recent years it's been a topic of debate whether teaching art in schools is necessary. Some argue that it is a waste of time and school curriculum should focus on academic subjects. In this essay I will be discussing both views and why i totally disagree with the prior notion.

To begin with, individuals who are advocating for not teaching art in schools base their argument on the fact that arts are something luxurious and children can practice it in their free time as a pastimetime activity. They believe that schools curriculum should focus and invest time on the important academic subject such as math, science and computer skills that will help pupils to succeed later on in their future careers.

However, We can not deny that through art young children can acquire important skills that are essential in life. Firstly, through art children can express unique ideas and thoughts that will help them to become creative thinkers . Moreover, it will help them to boost their confidence . A recent study that was conducted in the UK showed that children who participated in drama classes were able to overcome stage fright.Furthermore, artistic creations are born through solving problems. For example, turning the clay into a sculpture or portraying  emotion through a dance or a song . All of this improves youngsters' problem-solving skills which is a must to succeed in any career.

In conclusion, art is an important subject and it should be thought in school . only through art students can acquire skills such as creative thinking, problem-solving, non-variable communication and much more.","## Task Achievement:

"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should be encouraged to question and offer criticism of their teachers.","Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should be encouraged to question and offer criticism of their teachers. Others think this will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Write 250 words.

Some people opine that students should be supported to evaluate or criticize teachers, while others are worried that these acts would lead to a chaotic classroom. I personally side with the former view because the two-way communications helps instructors refine their teaching methods and enables students to become more involved in the lessons.

To begin with, educational standards can be raised because teachers can modify their ways of delivering lessons based on the students' feedbacks. For example, if the class is slow, it will be ineffective for teachers teach too fast so that most students would fall to retain the information. Therefore, based on the comments of students, lectures would find it is easier to know the appropriate speed of the lesson and adjust themselves to their audience. This would result in enhanced pedagogical methods of teachers.

Furthermore, i believe giving the students the freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings would enable them to become more proactive. For instance, many countries are promoting students-centred teaching with two-way communication, where open discussions between tutor and trainee are encouraged. This approach has a clear advantage of making students become more involved in studying. Increased participation in the classroom activities helps pupils understand and memorize lessons faster, which eventually improves the educational outcomes.

In conclusion, I believe allowing students to make judgement on teachers would result in better pedagogical methods of the educator and increase engagement of pupils in lessons.

Firstly, educational standards can be raised because teachers can modify their ways of delivering lessons based on the students' feedback.

Therefore, based on the comments of students, lecturers would find it easier to know the appropriate speed of the lesson and adjust themselves to their audience. This would result in teachers enhancing their pedagogical methods.

"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kind of artists, including painters, musicians and poets. However, other people think that this a waste of money. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.","The investment of government’s fund to artists or other aspects is a matter for debate. When supporters suppose authorities ought to offer support to people who engage in industries that are based on art. However, opponents reckon that money should be poured into other fields. Personally, there are several reasons and instance as follows supporting my view.

Supporters of providing assistance to art field argue that an increasing number of artworks need protecting and developing. Providing help to art will attract more people and create many job opportunities. What’s more, this would give the people a sense of happiness.

On the other hand, other people believe that other domains, such as medical system and educational, are vital than using money in art because residents cannot bear the pressure of education and medical due to lower salaries and without medical insurance in some developing nations. If the government financial them, they no longer worry about the fees when they are ill. 

In my opinion, whether a country should provide assistance access to all sorts of artists depends on its financial and nation’s culture. Developed nations typically have accumulated substantial funds, technologies, and experience, allowing them to provide expertise for them without stress. On the flip side, the developing world, struggling with limited resources, may have no substitute but to priorities other areas such as infrastructure development and job creation instead.

In conclusion, while publicly funded access to healthcare and education can have many benefits, it may not be suitable for all countries. Ultimately, the decision should be made based on the unique priorities and available resources of each nation.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that youngsters ought to do free social work in their leisure time which might benefit both teenagers and community. I am in complete favor of the above statement and I will give my stance with relative examples in the upcoming paragraphs.

To commence with the first and foremost point to support my opinion is that it helps to built social relationships with strong base. In other words, children are encouraged by their parents and oldest to do social work for free which further help in the development of moral values in the individual and teaches them the lessons like caring and sharing for others. As an illustration, during recent pandemic, many different age groups came forward to help each other to cope with this problem, but the main centre of attraction were children who stole everyone's heart by serving to the communities with their small hands. Thus, help done by teenagers has positive effect on community as well as on children themselves which promote healthy social bonding.

Moreover, the other reason is that it helps in the community development. To put it in another way, creative mind of young generation put many interesting ideas into actions which ultimately benefit the overall development of the society by various means. For instance, competitions could be held to paint the old walls of building or other vacant places which in turn, give a chance to teenagers to show the creativity and on the other hand it would enhance the beauty of the community. As a result, unpaid help by teenagers serve community to maintain its images. Furthermore, it enhances children to develop humanity in them by serving the needy people of community and make them responsible citizens of society in future.

In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that encouraging teenagers for doing unpaid work will strengthen the social liabilities and additionally promote humanity among teenagers and helps in the beautification of the community.","## Task Achievement:

Many customs and traditional ways of behaviors are no longer relevant to the modern life and no worth keeping. Do you agree or disagree?,"In this contemporary epoch, the issue of whether or not traditional cultures need to be upgraded is certainly a contentious one. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, I personally believe that such updating is paramount in order to accomplish homogeneity among nations and for the sake of art innovation and creativity. In this essay, 2 of the primary reasons why I totally agree with this trend will be further  elaborated.

To embark on, the first and also the most crucial reason relates to the upsurge in cutting-edge electronics and the fact that the whole universe has become a small village. This means that different nations have become in close and more prolonged contact than ever before. An eminent example of this is social media platforms which have enabled internet users to get acquainted with different cultures and traditions across the world. Thus, what can be said is that in order to accept and tolerate  this digitalized world, inherited traditions ought to be modified. 

Further and even more importantly, though, is the new opportunities which will allow artists to be innovative. In other words, if craftsmen, artists and musicians are exposed to different cultures, they will not only bring cultural diversity to their artworks  but also this will impact positively upon society at large. This can be witnessed in different disciplines of art which require fresh ideas to become vibrant and lively. Hence, I would contend that the democratic nature of art requires updating the conventional thoughts of people. 

In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, it can be reiterated that I believe that this issue is likely to become more important in the future as borders between countries have become increasingly blurred. Therefore, I am convinced that authorities ought to encourage it in order to accomplish cultural diversity and innovation in different aspects.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to what extent do you agree or disagree ?,"Many people are inclined to think that raising the price of petrol; diesel and motors  is one of the effective approaches to overcome  environmental pollution. I  disagree to a major extent with this notion. My position is justified further with reasons and examples.

The foremost argument to justify my view is that increasing rates of fuel may arise a lot of financial problems for many public. As the youngsters are travelling from rural to city areas on a daily basis  for jobs may face difficulty in managing their money. Also, most of the middle-class  can not afford costly transportation so they may lose their long-distance work owing to the high cost of travelling. However, there are other measures which can help to ameliorate the problems of the environment without any negative effects. Firstly, the government should encourage mankind to use electric shipment. This means  electronic vehicles are the best option as they will not emit any poisonous fumes into the air. The best epitome is  the USA , a developed nation, in which the  automatic transportation system  (electric tram) is introduced by authorities decades ago which helped in the reduction of air pollution.

On the other hand, others claim that the high cost of fuels can remedy the situation of environmental pollution. The main reason is that it will restrict folks from unnecessary usage of personal transportation. It has been observed that in city areas most of the youngsters have their own transit ergo they use more frequently for commuting which will cause the  air contamination. But, the high price of fuels may encourage them to benefit from public transport in lieu of  cars. This will create a positive impact on the surrounding by reducing air pollutants. 

In conclusion, notwithstanding at some point increase cost of petrol can help to overcome environmental problems by putting a restriction on the public for unnecessary usage of cars, the demerits of this situation can not be overlooked. Thus, authorities encouraging crowds to use electric trams and subways can be a more effective way to mitigate the issues about the environment.","## Task Achievement:

The only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing. Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend? Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

More and more individuals are inclined to do perilous sports, including hang-gliding, mountain climbing, and car racing.

"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old.

Discuss both views and give your opinion. > DISCUSS AND OPINION","Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about the finance issue after they retire. However, whether they should save money by themselves or receive assistance from the government is a controversial issue. This essay will discuss both sides and my view is that a financial-independent person will bring more merits.

It is clear that authority plays an important role in allocating resources to improve their national security and the general welfare of its people. A disturbing fact is that there are a lot of older citizens who unable to work to earn a living out there, some of them even do not have their own children to rely on. So, the government should give their top priority to assuring high-quality life for especially the elderly. However, a strong rising of the old-age dependency ratio year by year seems to be a great burden on the government efforts of improving the quality of life. If each person can save money on their own, the government could spend these expenses to solve other problems like reducing the unemployment rate or tackle environmental issues and so on.

Besides, it is undeniable that the older generation today have rich knowledge and gain many practical experiences through their career, hence, they have self-awareness enough to prevent themselves from becoming a social burden as they are afraid of being an unworthy person when they get old. Although each family member should take care and provide basic needs for the elder people, it would be unethical for the old to rely totally on them. So they tend to save a certain amount of money from their monthly income in their early period of a career in order to avoid dependency on others and enjoy their old age. 

In conclusion, despite governments should hold the duties of providing its citizens with efficient subsidies, I believe that people should prepare for their living expenses when they get older rather than expect from government grants.","## Task Achievement:

Young people are often influenced in their behaviors and situations by others of the same age. This is called “peer pressure”. Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?,"Peer influence, colloquially recognized as peer pressure, stands as a pervasive dynamic within the socio-ecological framework, casting its defining imprint upon the behavioral paradigms and life circumstances of juveniles. The present exposition aspires to undertake a rigorous exegesis to proffer perspicuity on whether the liabilities intrinsic to peer influence inordinately eclipse its boons.

The beneficial ramifications that emanate from positive peer pressure are unequivocal. Predominantly, it operates as a galvanizing stimulant of unprecedented magnitude. When adolescents are privy to their peers achieving remarkable milestones across a diversity of domains, such as scholastic prowess or athletic endeavors, an incendiary spark of inspiration is kindled. This competitive impetus, an aspirational cascade of achievement, engenders not only personal flourishing but also orchestrates an elevation of accomplishments hitherto deemed unattainable.

Moreover, the profound compass of peer influence extends to the genesis of quintessential social adeptness. Ongoing interaction with peers imparts a nuanced education in the fine arts of negotiation, effective communication, and the nuances of collective decision-making. These quintessential competencies stand as crucial instruments requisite for navigating the labyrinthine precincts of adulthood, enshrining their indispensability in contexts as diverse as professional environs and intricate relational matrices.

However, to confine our reflection solely within the precincts of advantage is to sidestep the abiding adversities concomitant with peer influence. Negative peer pressure, notably pernicious, frequently catalyzes perilous comportment among juveniles. This coersive undercurrent may compel individuals to partake in deleterious activities, encompassing substance consumption and debauched indulgences, to assimilate with their peer cohort. This ignites multifarious threats, not only to the somatic and psychological well-being of these impressionable adolescents but also to the impending specter of legal censure and social reprobation.

Additionally, the regulatory agency of peer influence, far from being an innocuous agent of camaraderie, possesses the latent potential to occlude individuality and extirpate personal identity. The magnetic allure of group conformity, in its more potent manifestations, potentially incites individuals to disavow their dearly held values and renounce their innate passions in the inexorable quest for conformity. The resultant repercussions include arrested self-actualization and the preclusion of the unbridled exploration of unique talents and idiosyncrasies.

In summation, the variegated tapestry of peer influence, replete with contrasting facets, undeniably wields considerable sway over the comportment and vicissitudes of the adolescent cohort. While the boons intrinsic to positive peer pressure are starkly conspicuous, notably in the realms of motivation and the cultvation of pivotal social dexterity, it is incontrovertible that the attendant liabilities, prominently featuring injurious behaviors and the stifling of individuality, are equally trenchant. Thus, it becomes incumbent upon the burgeoning generation to adroitly calibrate the scales of influence, ensuring that the choices they make are circumspect, fostering a trajectory of personal evolution that is both discerning and positive.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Nowadays, lots of people are being notices of becoming more interested in knowing about the past of the house they live in. 

Everyone has his own reasons for knowing this history, despite some of the reasons that could be mutual. First of all, people tend to have a great connection with the house they lived in since they were children. Furthermore, they don’t like to leave for a new residential district. Accordingly, they become more open to knowing more about it. On the other hand, those residents are more likely to sell the house so they will start searching for the history of the building. Provided that they have found the needed information, they will not solely sell a house but also sell the story of the building. This means the seller earns tons of money, ,however the buyer feels proud of the place they will move to.

Finding out about the history of a given house is yet an easy mission. It requires hours of research, hardworking, and attention to dates and timelines. In my humble opinion, there are quite a few steps people can follow to accomplish this mission. Firstly, by asking their parents if they might know any information regarding the history of the house. Unless they find anything, they shall search for the sale contract of the building at which they will be able to know who was the owner of the house. Finally, they will look for the ex-owners and ask them about the place. 

All in all, searching for the history of the building is not an easy mission. It requires patience and dedication but sooner or later after following the aforementioned steps, they will definitely finish their mission and reach their goal.","## Task Achievement:

"some people believe that studying at university or college is the best rout to a successful career, while other believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is becoming extremely challenging for young individuals to decide what career they want to choose straight after school. Consequently, some argue that universities and colleges should be necessary to complete, so that young individuals can develop their professional skills and get ready to build a successful life. I strongly agree with this statement, because schools provide individuals just with basic knowledge which has to be improved further through higher institutions.

First and foremost, even though schools have a variety of subjects, it is not enough for starting a working career. This is mainly because professions require specific knowledge of skills which need to be mastered during higher education. For instance, to work as a teacher, in any country, it is crucial to learn how to manage a class with many children, organise lessons and  follow a particular school's curriculum. Hence, developing professional abilities before working at school will help to prevent problems during the teaching process.

Additionally, the child who just finished school is still immature to work in a professional environment, as they have never experienced it before. Universities and colleges provide a great opportunity for students not to participate in theoretical subjects only, such as lectures and seminars, but also to participate in the placement where individuals can practice their skills getting familiar with an employment space. Take Melbourne University, for example, which collaborates with many local companies to employ students for volunteer jobs.

In conclusion, even though some universities need to be paid a tuition fee, it is worth doing so as they offer a range of possibilities to expand students' knowledge, as well as prepare them for a future career. Hence, I strongly believe that higher education is vital for those who want to be successful and confident in a new working environment.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The world is now surrounded by many urgent environmental problems, and many people feel that raising the cost of fuel is one of the most effective ways of combatting them. Although I tend to agree with this viewpoint, I believe there are other environmental measures that need to be taken. 

Increasing petrol prices would help save the environment in many ways. As the number of vehicles on the roads is increasing dramatically, so is the amount of vehicular emissions released into the atmosphere. However, if governments increase fuel costs, this solution would serve as a deterrent for people who drive their private cars, reducing air pollution and ozone layer depletion. Besides discouraging people from driving their private cars, this would also generate income to make further investments in environmental initiatives. Given these potential benefits of raising fuel prices, is it hardly surprising to see so many countries applying it to practice.

Apart from increasing the cost of fuel, we can also implement other solutions to environmental issues. For instance, on an individual level, people who want to help the environment should become more environmentally responsible by buying eco-friendly products, and reusing and recycling plastic bags. They can also take public transport as opposed to their personal cars, which produce toxic fumes. From a government’s perspective, it is essential to switch to green energy sources, such as solar and wind, rather than continuing to rely on gas and petrol. Thus, environmental protection goes beyond just raising fuel prices. 

In conclusion, though I attach great importance to the practice of increasing fuel costs, I think that both individuals and governing bodies should become environment-oriented in their mindset to tackle environmental problems.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In a number of corners in the world, there is a growing interest in researching the historical background of the appartments occupied by nation. This essay will consider possible causes of this interest and decide on how people can accomplish this goal.

To begin with, knowledge about the history of the building contains much valuable information such as the date of construction and which materials were used. These facts contribute to safety of the building and its financial and historical value. For instance, if residents know that the house they live in is obsolete or made of breakable wood, it is much easier for them to determine what actions and renovations should be undertaken in order not to let the building be destroyed. Moreover, knowing what historical events took place in a specific building or what architect designed a facade might rise the building's costs significantly and make it unique. Taking Almaty, my hometown, as an example, there are expensive appartments in the city centre which have faced a lot of important historical revolutions and were constructed in an outstanding way attracting local celebrities.

While doing research on the history of the accommodation can have numerous advantages, it is challenging to obtain precise data because the only way to do it by examinating official documents from the local authorities. The problem is that people must prove that they live in the certain building in order to find out about its history. For example, in my country, this issue is common because the access for information about the living areas is limited and can be granted to dwellers only, However, it is still feasible to determine the decade when the house was built judging by its design because this feature changes every time.

In conclusion, the rising interest on the house's background is reasonable due to safety concerns and the desire to establish the house's worth. I would recommend to conduct research based on documents issued by reliable sources because it's the most accurate data.","## Task Achievement:

"Detailed descriptions of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In today’s society, many detailed crime descriptions flood newspapers and TV. In my opinion, although the dissemination could lead to negative influences on society, an outright ban on this kind of information should not be imposed on mass media altogether. 

     It is beyond doubt that massive descriptions of crimes in detail can have negative influences on society. Firstly, this can be detrimental to children's growth. This is because the details of crime normally carry numerous questionable contents, including bloodiness and violence, and are considerably widespread through mass media like newspapers and TV on a repetitive basis, which have adverse impacts on children’s growth in a long run. Secondly, the broad exposure of crime descriptions in mass media may potentially result in youth crime. This is because that teenagers might be vulnerable to imitate negative behaviors from what they have seen from media. For example, the popularity of a series of gangster movies titled “Gu Huozai” caused many teenagers to imitate the plots of the movie, becoming gang members to do many illegal things such as theft and robbery. Therefore, crime details in mass media do have bad consequences on our society.

However, taking into account the aforementioned viewpoints does not necessarily yield an absolute conclusion that this kind of information should be forbidden in media for all. Acknowledging the latest criminal means through newspapers and TV could warn people to be precautionary, as a large number of people get information from the platform of media. So appropriate dissemination must be allowed. 

In conclusion, it is undeniable that detailed crime descriptions in mass media may have bad effects on society. However, it does not inherently guarantee an indisputable view that we should restrict such information altogether.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?,"In the last few decades, there has been an increase in problems related to the environment. Although some people believe that the best way to limit the issues is to increase the cost of fuels for vehicles and promote environmental eco-friendly vehicles, while others believe that those who need vehicles will use them regardless of fuel prices. This essay will discuss in detail and explain why I think, increasing the price of fuel is not the only solution.

Firstly, increasing the cost of fuel will lead to a hike in the prices of food products. For example, wholesalers use vehicles to transport their food and other products to their store location. This leads to an increase in service tax by the sellers including transportation charges and thus an increase in the cost price of the product. Also, the government should promote e-bikes and bicycles rentals as they are more eco-friendly and cheaper than public transport. Hence, an increase in the cost of fuel will not resolve the environmental problem permanently.

Secondly, people who are rich can still pay the higher prices for the fuel whereas the middle and lower class people do get impacted due to the prices. Rather than increasing the prices, the government should set up awareness campaigns for the public so that citizens understand the environmental issues and learn different ways to limit them. Campaigns like,  promoting the use of electric vehicles, providing subsidies on purchasing them or interest-free loans on eco-friendly vehicles.

To sum up, the above problems cannot be dealt with individually but needs collective effort from the government and the public. Therefore, I certainly think that there are other better methods to resolve the environmental issues rather than increasing the fuel prices.","**Task Achievement:**

Advertisements are becoming more and more common in our everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"The number of advertisements is increasing sharply in people's daily life. However, some individuals claim that this development is beneficial for human life but some believe advertisements can lead to a wide range of negative concerns for customers. Moreover, this essay is going to discover both sides behind this trend. 

On the one hand, advertisements would bring a lot of profit to several businesses when they rely on advertising to attract more people, especially small businesses. To illustrate, customers are frequently attracted by some products in advertisements because these usually provide a ton of exaggeration in order to make their products become much more fascinating, appealing, and qualified. Moreover, advertising also helps shoppers to prefer wisely among a huge number of products on the market. On the other hand, some also say that advertisements can lead to various negative influences on the environment such as releasing a ton of paper and other materials while creating an advertisement video. Besides that, advertising is believed to be misleading due to its exaggeration, which can distract individuals a lot. For instance, customers may make mistakes while shopping such as purchasing unqualified stuff and their money will be wasted. To conclude, there are still both many advantages and drawbacks of advertisements, however, the downsides tend to outweigh the positives.

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Every living organisms life are influenced by the weather system. Due to different types of pollutions, global warming and other factors the climate begins to change. A few peoples have the opinion that finding a living method according to the climate method is the better choice than that of controlling climatic changes.

Climate plays a significant role in the food products we consume daily to survive. Though we have a plethora of varaities of food across the world, every country will choose their own variety of food which suits their climatic condition. Frequent climate change will also impact the cultivation of crops. Mostly, farmers select the crops to be cultivated based on the seasons. For example, In India, the northern half remains to be cold and dry, so the farmers will cultivate wheat whereas, in southern half will have good rain and also it remains warm in few months of the year so the farmers in the south will choose rice. Even though we are in the technology developed world, there is no alternative found for food.

Not only humans but also other living organisms will also affect by this climatic change. Most of the animal breed based on the climate only as a consequence of climatic change the particular animal may move to the verge of extinction. Furthermore, It will also affect the trees and plants across the world. Factually, the average life span of trees are around 60 years and also they will grow based on the climate and soil types alone. If the climate started to change, there is a high probability of extinction of the trees. Trees are the major oxygen producer of the world, humans inhale oxygen to live. As a result, there is no possibility for the survival of the living organisms in the world.

In conclusion, by the above discussion, I strongly oppose the opinion of finding the method to live according to the climate change. If we chose there is less probability to get a high success rate. Because it requires the reconstruction of the whole world based on the climate changed which includes food, trees etc.","## Task Achievement:

"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Real estate has been drastically grown in metropolitan areas. The inability to provide a living area for the people in major cities is creating huge trouble whereas people believe that actions from authority alone will resolve the issue. I will examine all the possible aspects of this problem in this essay.

Finding the right place to live in a huge town has now become a big problem as the majority of the area has been constructed already. Hence we are required to go further to the city outskirts to find shelter. When we tend to move further away, we have to spend a lot of time on travel to work and other essentials. Also, we will not be having the facilities like the municipality in terms of sewage, transportation, and water. We also have to bear the cost of the above facilities which will increase the monthly wages.

Some individuals believe that only the government action will eradicate this situation and fulfill their needs in terms of providing a livable environment in the urban area. They want the ministry to take a look into the housing requirements and come up with a development plan which will lead them into a peaceful area. I strongly admire that without the people who are willing to take care of the responsibilities, the government can not achieve a solution. We as an individual have to try for a solution within our range like bringing the basic facilities to the place where we live and creating some employment in local itself.

To conclude, A place of residence is a very basic need for everyone in the world. When working in a huge town we might face hardships finding a residence. But we should be ready to face and rectify it instead of relying on the government to announce some scheme to resolve the difficulty.","## Task Achievement:

"SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT PURCHADING OMPORTES ARGRICULTURAL PRODICTS HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT. Others think consuming domestic products is better. 

Dicuss both these views ang give your own opinion.","There are differing opinions regarding consuming agricultural products or buying products planted in our country. To content the food demand, it is necessary to deliver food abroad. However, from my perspective, I prefer to consume domestic foods to support local farmers.

 

On the one hand, Taiwan is an intense island with limited resources. People would like to exert each land’s value. To make the world operates more efficiently then importing is essential. For instance, Taiwan imported numerous economic crops from America due to mechanical farming methods are much cheaper than Taiwan. Regarding worldwide, the same products which make the less consumption of natural resources are more environmentally friendly. In this concern, shipments of agriculture and trading products foster eco-friendly.

 

Nevertheless, the complex economic system is not only for efficiency but also for employment rates. Concerned with the entire worldwide operation, if people solely consume aboard products, it could cause abundant farmers to lose their jobs. Furthermore, recently the farmland decreased and was substituted into factories. It could lead to other environmental issues such as air pollution and decreased species diversity. With the healthy awareness arousing, citizens prefer to purchase local products than imported foods, which even are more expensive. People care about the food’s quality and it can reduce transportation distances. Besides, accelerating local district economic growth can make the country's system operation more stable and also could enhance social bonding.

"As major cities in the world are growing today, so do their problems. What are the problems for young people who are living in the cities as the result of continued growth? What are the solutions for these problems?","It is true that the nations have increasingly developed, which means that current generations of these countries face a significant number of pressures when residing in the metropolises. In this essay, I will point out the origins of this phenomenon, and suggest several methods to mitigate it. 

To begin with, several factors act as a catalyst for such a phenomenon. First, the competition in vocations is increasingly serious. To be specific, the proportion of newly-graduated students is extremely high, but available occupations are unable to meet their needs. In fact, in Vietnam, almost all businesses only employ staff who have over one year of experience, which results in a significant number of unemployed individuals. Second, adults who migrate to metropolises always have the pressures of success. To elaborate, said citizens always want to have a new life with a stable income to take care of their family and themselves. In the long run, this destructively impacts their psychology such as depression. 

Fortunately, this phenomenon can be tackled when various measures are taken. The most pertinent point is that The coalition between universities and firms would create career opportunities for undergraduates. Specifically, these days, universities would arrange for  final-year students to intern at numerous firms to have practical knowledge. In reality, at  Foreign Trade University in VietNam, teachers frequently organize professional events to help undergraduates orientate their lines of work in the future. Another justification is that households and communities play an important role in the developing career of adults. In particular, families and society should communicate and accompany them in the built-processing careers of the young in urban centres. In addition,current generations are encouraged to engage in clubs to decrease stress. 

In conclusion, it is disputable that the rate of unemployment and the pressure of life are menaces for minors in cities. Therefore, the combination between schools and families is of paramount importance in alleviating it.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that the best way of improving public health is by increasing sport facilities. Others believe this will have little effect and than other measures.
Discuss both views and give your opinion","Ways of improving the general wellbeing of the entire populace has been a subject of discussion in recent years. While a sect of people is of the opinion that a significant addition to the existing number of sport facilities represents the best way of improving physical conditions of the public, others opine that having a large number of such facilities would not have the desired effect. This essay will discuss both views and explain why other measures such as reducing pollution in the environment and routine vaccinations against spreadable diseases are better options that can be utilized to achieve this aim.

On the one hand, sports and sporting activities present a perfect escape route and a means for de-stressing.  As people engage in sports like running, cycling, they are able to build up their body muscles, blow off steam, and also get adequate blood flowing within their body system properly. In addition, watching sports as a form of entertainment also helps to relax the entire system thereby improving both mental and physical wellbeing of the people. Therefore, increasing the number of sport facilities would not only present an avenue for more people to both partake in sport activities and enjoy the view as a spectator, but also help them relax and forget about their current stress.

However, measures such as significant reduction of air pollution can have greater effects on increasing the overall fitness of the populace. A lot of pollution related health problems have been reported in several developing countries. Finding a solution to this pertinent problem would greatly aid both physical and mental conditions of the public. To add to this, routine vaccinations against spreadable diseases would also ensure that more people are in better shape Healthwise. For example, frequent immunizations for the flu disease would significantly boost the immune system.

In conclusion, this essay discussed the use of increased sports facilities as a tool for improving the public wellbeing as well as other measures such as pollution reduction and vaccinations. In my opinion, while sports activities can help to improve our general outlook, utilizing other measures as discussed in the essay presents a far better option and would generate greater and optimum results.","## Task Achievement:

Any country should be able to sell goods to other countries without the restrictions of the government. Do you agree or disagree?,"There should be  free trade among nations with no limitations from local governing bodies on the import of items from  other nations. This will allow  access to globally available technology and medications to everyone. Furthermore, it will establish a good relationship between people of different localities. It will increase the economical gap among the republics. I partially agree with the statement and elaborate further in the next coming paragraphs. 

To begin with, this will allow the developed states to export their products to underprivileged areas and in ,return they can get  cheaper raw materials from those territories. Additionally, those republics can achieve a workforce with lower wages, this means that such companies will make more profit and contribute to the GDP of the country. Moreover, well-educated and skilful people will migrate to developed countries, meaning brain drain will take place in third-world places. For instance, some African nations going through a shortage of doctors and nurses due to  migration. Hence, this will widen the gap between the terrains.

On the other hand, poor countries will become  poorer in regard to money,manpower and technical skills. For example, the duty-free export agreement with China leads Pakistan to the edge of bankruptcy with inflation rising in  every field. Such kind of business reduces the foreign currency reserve of the region to a critically low level, pushing them into debt. Similar way labour and service industry is going to suffer as there will be no customers.

In conclusion, considering the effects of  open trade on both exporters and importers, it will be harmful to the recipient party and fruitful to sending company. That's why I agree in part with the idea of tax-less transactions.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that it is a waste of money for countries to host big sporting events like the world cup, and that the money would be better spent on other things. However, others think that hosting large sporting events has a clear, positive impact on a country.


Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","People hold contradictory opinions regarding governmental funding for holding sports events. Critics decry it as an inefficient allocation, and state that other essential infrastructures deserve this monetary aid, however, others think in contrast. I will discourse on either side in this essay, and state my opinion.

Opponents of international sports state that it is a wastage of resources, particularly for developing countries. Because poverty alleviation and other substructures should be the utmost priorities for any authority. Such important issues are likely to be dilapidated if a huge sum of money is disbursed on sporting events, such as cricket or the football world cup. By eliminating poverty, nations grow as a whole and more mouths can be fed than before, unlike when the government prefers to spend money on sports. Furthermore, a mass gathering of people at sports ground can further cause problems for the state to tackle as the crowd can be vulnerable to safety threats, and providing security to the audience can be exorbitant too. Hence, funding on big sports events is less essential than alleviating poverty which may have longer-lasting impacts.

Nevertheless, others believe hosting Olympic games between different nations relaxes political tension and builds rapport among diverse ethnic groups. Folks from around the world gather for a shared viewing experience and to root for their teams. For example, in the PSL Cricket tournament in Pakistan, people from around the country were on the same page irrespective of their cultural background. Besides, the government generated hefty revenue by selling sports match tickets to the audience, which is another productive impact of hosting such events. To illustrate this, various countries struggle to take the honour of congregating cricket world cups in their homeland to support local markets to merchandise their products during these matches, such as hotels are fully booked on match days. Therefore, it can be said that conducting such sports is worth spending financial resources on them.

To conclude, although other crucial issues require governments' attention and funding, yet I believe the significance of sports tournaments can not be neglected. It is irrefutable that people from around the globe tend to partake in sporting events and develop harmony with each other. Besides that, governments further generate capital in turn.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that technology makes life overly complex, so we should make life simpler without using the technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, technology is a crucial part of human life. The community might lose a sense of life without technology. There is argued that life gets more messed up by futuristic devices. A simpler life is created without using technology. On the other hand, I personally disagree with the statement. I conversely think that things are simpler and easier with  technology. This essay will substantiate my opinions in the paragraph below

To begin with, the first following reason is technology provides time-efficient for people. Technology radically exemplifies fast and easy solutions. For example. a cleaning robot machine is one type of smart household machinery. There are several functions to cleaning and wiping the floor by itself. People who own it can do other important work instead of cleaning the house. The time-saving positively occurred.

Secondly, advanced machinery gives better life management in many aspects. Most of the population own a mobile smartphone currently whereas online applications are easily installed into the phones. Business management has been done online by  smartphones. For instance,  before era technology does not exist. if we want to do the financial activity with the banks such as transfer money we must go to the actual bank but now we can do it via smartphone within two to three minutes. As well as reminding us what we have to do in online schedules is help us to know what we should do on workdays.

The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Others think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The advantages of technology give us a lot of opportunity to develop themselves and our economy. Nevertheless, the growing of technologies are shared our society to two parts: one part become richer, another become poorer. Some people think that it is opposite effect for our society, while others believe conversely. In the following paragraphs I will present both opinions and  present my perspective.

Undoubtedly, the range of technologies are increased our economy and the intellect of people. People become more affrodable to knowledge because technologies give us opportunity to work with our mind not by hands, therefore we safe our energy to think For instance, people who take a chance, become rich: producers of TV, computers, phones and other devices, also people who can work with technology, because they are demanded in the market place.

By the way, we know a lot of people who cannot work with devices, computers, especially elderly people. It is hard for them to find jobs. Another point that people who work by hands waste their time and make less things than equipment. To illustrate this, modern industries use equipments, few operators and manager who can control it. Therefore, a lot of people can find job, because workers by hands not are demanded in the contemporary world.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Many people are of the opinion that younger' priority for a successful career is taking courses from higher education. However, some believe that getting jobs after finishing high school is better. This writer was in two minds and will discuss  both sides in this essay.

It is vital to understand that the higher qualifications students have, the better job they will get. They spend approximately four years on courses which taught they massive and professional knowledge in their fields such as law, and engineering. This means young people will gain expert knowledge and have more opportunities for promotion in their work. On the whole, a plan for further education after high school should be set up by young people.

It can be clearly seen that late teens will gain experience from early jobs which is essential for their career. During their work, they can always learn from their mentors some skills such as communicating and networking. Hence, this leads late teens to be more mature and able to solve problems in the working environment. Therefore, they can easily have better place due to their soft skills.

Personally, I hold the belief that students will gain more and more benefits from higher education. Although early jobs are attractive to teenagers, the university not only gives you specialized knowledge but also improves students' coop skills. 

All things considered, although getting work is an upward trend among youngers, more and more companies are likely to hire employees who have degrees or better qualifications.","## Task Achievement:

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"There has been a rise in producing consumer products, which leads to harmful impacts on the natural environment. While there are some reasons why this trend happens, several solutions can be taken to solve this problem.

To begin with, this tendency happens due to a number of reasons. The first one is that the more products people manufacture, the more trash such as defective items people throw at the nature, especially the aquatic habitat. This would result in water or air pollution. Additionally, in order to get necessary materials such as wood for the manufacturing process, businesses’ owners normally have to gain them by exploiting from the environment, which could lead to deforestation or soil erosion. For example, the Son Tung logging company used to cut trees a lot, which led to the biggest flood ever recorded in the history of Vietnam.

Fortunately, several measures can be done to deal with this issue. Firstly, entrepreneurs can apply technological developments to recycle trash, so that, these trash can be used again and again. By following this idea, enterprises can reduce the regularity of leaving trash in the nature. Secondly, the government should apply some laws against exploiting natural resources. For example, if I keep illegally deforesting the Amazon rainforest despite not being allowed to do it, I might result in  permanently being in jail as a punishment or even being put to death penalty.


In conclusion, when manufacturing consumer goods, people exploit resources from and throw trash at the environment, which would lead to negative impacts on nature. Applying the newest technologies and some strict laws can help to solve this serious issue.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, many countries are facing  the same issue, which is climate change. Therefore, people think that instead of preventing weather change,  they better find a solution to deal with this problem. I agree with this statement. In this essay, I will explain both situations and my personal view. 

To begin with, global warming has been an enormous problem on the earth for years. Today, weather changes a lot compared with  the past. In some, countries the weather is getting very hot around 48 to 52 degree. Other countries are getting a lot of rain and hail. Therefore, these changes are affected people live, especially farmers.

Thus, they feel so stressed about the climate changes.

Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour than for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example to the young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the present days, some people obey that a notable person receiving prosperity without the appropriate and sufficient efforts. Therefore, this phenomenon has sparked heated debates among individuals for the excessive acquirement of the celebrities that obtain the reputation without a proper performance and contributes to a bad role model among young adults. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this statement and in order to receive a reputation its required large efforts from the celebrity themselves.
To begin with, to become a public figure, the celebrity must provide the large effort as well as performance for having spots in the society. Besides, it required great talent and potential to become remarkable and noticeable. As a result, their potential is sufficient for having a large achievement and fulfilment. Moreover, adolescents will imitate their actions and keen to obtain this achievement, thus the celebrities set a positive mindset among teenagers. For instance, young people nowadays willing to become successful and they put the notable person as a role model and follow their path to obtain the prosperity.
Secondly, the accomplishment of the talented people brought children to desire for the satisfaction in their own lives. Children will start imitating the movement of their loves’ ones. For example, enrolling in an extra course, such as dancing or acting classes. Consequently, children obtain a potential and make use of their leisure time instead of spending too prolonged time doing a wasteful activity. In addition, children, who have special skills will acquire an extra amount of salary.
To conclude, a celebrity, who have obtained an accomplishment and reputation, is worthwhile for their performance. Besides, this achievement sets a positive development for the children to develop themselves to achieving a glamour and prosperous like an artist.","### Task Achievement:

"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism of their teachers. Others think it will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. 
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is widely believed that for a country to prosper, it is of paramount importance to assure a high level of educational standard. In order to do so, some people claim that high school students should be able to make comments or even criticism on their teachers, which I believe would be beneficial despite the view that it could lead to a disrespectful and undisciplined study environment. 

It is understandable why some people have voiced their concern over the act of students being able to judge their own teachers. To them, doing so means teachers and students are on equal terms, which can trigger the rebellious side in the latter and they may make comments full of animosity directed at their teachers, which is undoubtedly a sign of disrespect. In addition, some are afraid that teachers being judged might lose their authority, which can be an opportunity for delinquents at school to wreak havoc and cause trouble. Nevertheless, I believe these problems can be dealt with if there is proper regulation about student comments. For instance, any feedback without solid evidence or one showing prejudice can be disregarded when evaluating the performance of teachers.

On the other hand, I concur that having students give presumably constructive comments can be advantageous to the educational system as a whole. The key rationale is that teachers and instructors are presented with a chance to self-reflect, which means they might adopt a more student-centred approach while teaching. To illustrate, some teachers in international schools in Vietnam have chosen a facilitator style in class, after comments from students and parents. Even with the controversy this might raise, like shattering teacher’s self-esteem and causing them to quit; or the fact that graduate students might become reluctant when applying for a teaching role in view of the uneasy feeling of being judged, I believe that a teacher that is willing to change to strive for the better would be an invaluable asset to the education system.

To conclude, even though some people are against feedback and comments on teachers with the fear of losing discipline in class, I still support this idea, as it can really help teachers hone their teaching skills, benefitting the system in the long run. If there are some schools that are still adamant about this initiative, I suggest that they can use questionnaires first, before reverting back to written comments.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think that family has the most powerful influence on a child’s development, while others think that other factors such as television, friend, music have the biggest effects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?","There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether parents or other aspects such as television and friend is more effective on a child's development. In my opinion, I believe that although the family has the biggest impact on children, overall the environment and media are more effective. This essay will consider these different elements of powerful influence sources, before concluding that they are all vital.

First off,  some insist that while education starts in the family, it has the biggest effect on a child’s development.  As younger children are more affected and they spend most of the time with their family, parents have great obvious influences on the children. For instance, children may behave similarly to their father or mother in the next ages. Additionally, there are some genetic effects on these heritage behaviours. Although genetics mostly remains in the phenotype, many scientists who have studies conducted on behavioural genetics, state genetics plays a big role in personality. 

Conversely, many think that the impacts of media and friend environment are bigger than the family. Since there is a variety of news on social media and traditional sources and spending most of their time online, children are more vulnerable to resistance. Also, youth people can influence emotionally by famous people in movies or even songs of their favourite singers and it can affect to change their character. Taking scientific research as an example, it can be seen that the biggest proportion of children's role models are celebrities. Furthermore, kids are generally being a friend who has similar features to them and when they feel more close the friends, they can copy others' thought or disparities.

In conclusion, there is a debate about the biggest factor in a child’s development. From my perspective, even though both have many contributions to the child, the most powerful influence of the source is other factors such as friends, television and music rather than family.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that the dress code of employees is not necessary, it is simply because it does not affect the quality of their production. In my point of view, I agree with this opinion, however, it does not also show off the professionalism and respect of staff as well as formal clothes.

On the one hand,  employees do not need to care about clothes when they go to company. Firstly, it will make them more happy and motivated when they wear their favourite attire. Furthermore, they can wear normal dresses, which will make them more comfortable. For example, employees work in a private environment and  spend most of their time on a computer or laptop, comfortable clothes are easier to work in and make them more relaxed.

Formal wear or uniform shows professionalism and respect for customers and clients will also realize waiters or waitresses faster, thus saving time and effort . Besides, it is fair for staff in the company and it is not indiscriminate poor or rich, so make staff more confident when they trial.  Hence, a certain type of job like receptionist requires people to dress properly so it cannot worsen the company’s productivity .

Employment should give their staff at least a 4-week holiday a year to make employees better at their jobs. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Holidays are provided by companies to their personnel for various reasons. Some employment grants sick leave, casual leave as well as annual leave as per policy. In my opinion, I agree that a 4-week break a year is a great idea to make institute prosper at their jobs. It gives department extra encouragement as well as helps them to mitigate personal issues to feel tension-free with the help of a long break.

To begin with, catalyst is a key factor that enables staff to do well in their duties and having a 4-week break annually definitely helps. For example, After getting such a long leave personnel will come back to their workstation with reinvented energy as whatever dissatisfaction they have will fade away by the time they join. It is a natural boost for department to do well. Above all, desire is always a major factor in any type of responsibility.

On the other hand, Felling relieved is always a welcoming factor for any employee and having a 4-week holiday in a year job holders can easily solve their personal issues. According to  recent research by a Workforce provider organization, staff who stay tension-free in their job from personal issues do significantly well than those who don't. Relived employees from any type of family problems are always a plus point. Finally, with a long leave, Any external factors can be easily manageable.

In a nutshell, encouragement and feeling relief are key factors that contribute to workers' performance.

"The housing shortage in big cities can cause severe social consequences. Some people think only government action can solve this problem. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","Over the past few decades, the issue of housing shortage in an urban area has been a major concer because the pricely land caused serious problems in society. Althought some people claim that only goverments can deal with this issue, in my opinion with a combination both of the goverment and individual, this problem can be tackled  as I will discuss in the following essay. 


There is no doubt that goverments have power to establish legislation and subsidies. For example, goverments will fine real estate agencies if they overcharge in the amount of price to live in the city, Therefore, real estate agencies would provide a reasonable price to sale. Furthermore, another thing goverments can do is to provide financial supportted who buy housing in the city . A good example of this is Taiwan goverment share a proportion of money to subsidies people who buying a husing in the urban area. As a result, citizens can alleviate the financial burden. 



On the other hand, individual also need to take actions in order to deal with this issue. People should try  find vertical apartments instead of  private twonhouses in urban area. For example,  In Sigarpore, the marjoority people tend to live in high-rise building so that more people can live in the city. By doing this,  apartments can accommodate more population in the urban area. 


In Conculsion, despite the fact that government should take most responsibility, from my perspective, a combination of government and individul should be accordinated to solve the proble.

"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","Nowadays, an increasing number of people has their children in a later age tan people from past generations. It is agreed that having children at a later age can provide a couple with more maturity and stability. Therefore, the essay will, fistrly, talk about some of the reason why this trend increases with the time, and secondly, discuss the most important advantage of taking such a decision. 

Preferences and goals in life changed always between generations, and the younger ones are putting the need to be parents at a lower relevance than ever before. This is mainly because they want to do other things first, and develop their life as individual, before taking the adventure to have a family. Moreover, young people preffer having a little finacncial stability after a couple of working years, to later on take the decision to have kids. For instance, a survey made by the University of Cologne in 2015, stated that more of the half of bachelor students were planning ahead their next 5 to 10 years without the need of having a baby or erasing a family.

Even though many consider that being old as a parent presents many disadvantages, there are also plenty of upsides of it. Maybe the most important one is flexibility, as young people are not needed to rush into being parents if they do not have the time, economic stability, or knowledge. This could lead to benefits at the time to being parents, as they have a more structured path to take. or example, a poll by the German government explained that couples that had a baby at the age of 30 or older were better prepared and had less doubts about their decision.

In conclusion, this essay is not requesting people to have kids on their thirties, because such a decision is very personal, but it is always good to be stable, to have the possibility of planning the future better.","## Task Achievement:

"Nations should spend more money on skills and vocational training for practical work, rather than on university education. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, there are two opposite beliefs about the educational system in many nations. Some people believe that the amount of budget governments invest on skills and vocational training for practical work should be larger than that on university education. Meanwhile, the others support the contrast view. From my perspective, the weight of practical work and theories in schools is merely equal so both of them should be invested.

On the one hand, theoretical courses organized on university education are one of the first requirements of people in the market. Most of the positions in society require qualified employees, which means they should enroll in theoretical courses at university to get more academic knowledge and achieve the necessary certificates. Moreover, the professional courses are strong basements for people to develop their career path in the long-term. For example, they have more opportunities to promote to higher levels or apply these knowledge and work in many different fields, leading to utilization of human resources in many nations. Thus theoretical courses organized on university education are worth for government allocating money to.

On the other hand, skills and vocational training for practical work are also important for nations in many aspects. In particular, when the particular worker, such as electricians, workers in factory, cleaners own good skills and are trained carefully, not only the customers become more confident in using service but also the higher salary can be paid to the workers, helping ensure the spending for their life. Furthermore, after gaining the solid skills, people can transfer them to other who cannot get the qualifies, resulting in a decrease in unemployment rates. Therefore, it is reasonable for government to distribute the budget to develop skills and vocational training.

In conclusion, although university education should be maintained in many nations to many modern sectors such as technology,industry, ect., skills and vocational training for practical work is focused on to develop for ensuring life of many qualified people.","## Task Achievement:

"Experts believe that, over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. 
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","Science is moving forward faster than most people can process.

We could say that Part of a country development can be measure through their technological advances and how it directly affect soceity. 

An advantage that stands out of having robots doing human's jobs is the precision level a field can achieve with its tasks on a daily basis.

Another advantage would be the improvement in the time frame to produce goods or deliver tasks, As it has being with car production. For example Ford is known to be the first car company to introduce the assambly line to their production, making it the first company in the USA to produce more cars in less time.

Moving aside all the good it could bring, we must also put in a scale the human capital being compromised due to big industries not needing their skills anymore. Nowadays doing the job of houndreds of people excaving we have very impressive machinery that can do the same job being operated just by one persone in lesser time.

measures can be taken to protect them ?","It is observed that customes are challenged with elevating expenditure of commercials from enhancing companies. There areseveral reasons behind the issue; However, certain steps can be taken to curb this isssue. Both the causes as well as remedies are discussed in ensuing paragraph.

Discussing the reasons behind number of advertisement issue, the foremost one is that buyers confuse about buying a particular product. To validate, By seeing a pletora of choices to select any one it makes difficult to them. Besides it, consumers feel distracting while working on internet.

"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","There is no doubt that earning while studying has many advantages. There are some people support acquiring a job a long with education, others oppose this due to some reasons. In my opinion, I strongly believe in former view because it has some merits.

On the one side of the argument, it is sometimes thought students would focus only their academics instead of  getting a part- time work. This is because engaging in the other activities might result in poor performance in the examinations. Consequently, these learners would suffer a lot as they could not show an excellent educational background in their adultood and employability would slim. For instance, in India, rarely, children have been allowed to work by both their parents as well as the teachers.

On the other hand, nevertheless, opponents of the above mentioned argument point that joining as a trainee in some work would give a better job perspects when they become adult. In other word, having an hands on experience in the field of preferrence, could give a chance to successful. For example, nursing students often work as a care giver during their student period.

Some people think that robots are important for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"In recent times, the development in the field of robotics has increased rapidly and its prevalence can be noticed in many places. Many believe robots are crucial for human development whereas some argue they have a negative effect on society. This essay would discuss both  views with empirical evidence and conclude with my opinion.

To begin with, artificial intelligence is one of the greatest milestones achieved by humans. They can be used to study places which are inaccessible to humans. For instance, the world-renowned rover Curiosity, was sent to Mars for a detailed analysis of the planet's features. Without robotic technology, it would take another decade to achieve this feat. Hence, this technology plays a vital role in the development of mankind.

On the other hand, robotic machines have replaced men in many jobs. For instance, in many food and packaging industries, programmed machines are used as they are more efficient and fast when compared to a worker. Furthermore, a robot can work for long hours without any breaks, thus increasing in productivity of a company. This scenario can lead to an increase in the unemployment rate causing a detrimental effect on  society.

Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Raising the price of petrol for vehicles and other transportation is one of the best ways for some people who believe that can solve 

environmental problems. I would like to share some of my opinions about it.

First of all, I agree that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems because nowadays there are too many cars running on the streets. Almost everyone has a car and does not like to use public transport because it is difficult to go to work by bus or metro ,especially from a suburb. However, if the government can raise the price of petrol and make their transportation systems more friendly, it will make citizens and tourists use it generally due to the financial concerns.

Secondly, the government can make some packages for the public transportation to inspire people to take them instance of driving their own cars. For example, if people can get discount from taking public transportation, they will be willing to do it from time to time. Besides, between different places, the governments can build systems for people to bike, if it is convenient for everyone to rent bikes from one place and return to another, it will be more and more popular for people to use it and make the environment friendly.

On the other hand, it is not only because  the cars produce too much carbonatite but also many other facts. Due to many studies, climate-changing 

 is cost by many different issues which include making products related to meat, factories, agriculture...etc. Therefore, all of the facts cost different levels of environmental problems and it 

all results in climate-change.

It is said that people in the 21st century will have much more leisure time than before.

Firstly, as well known, Technology is the symbol of advance produce. For example, machines can replace many jobs that people did by hand in the 20th century. Besides, the advanced information communication technology can contribute to people’s remote cooperation work and conferences quickly. And it helps to decrease time consuming comparing to the past when people spent most of the time on the journey to the meeting, for instance.

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Recently, climate change became the buzzword of the news feed. More and more people agree that except preventing this global disaster, we should seek alternative means to survive. Personally, I strongly disagree with this provision. This essay will provide reasons to underpin my belief.

There is no doubt that individuals’ efforts are too small to stop the weather condition entirely. However, if everyone overlooks and underestimates the outcomes coming from climate change, our descendants might encounter a worse environmental crisis than we met. According to the current study, there are numerous countries in Europe and North America that deal with the heat wave of around 42 degrees before summertime this year. Extreme weather events render a variety of impacts and damages not only to nature but to human beings. They have to tackle the water shortage and wildfire which are related to hot and drought weather conditions. Therefore, the environment will become from bad to worse and threaten our living quality.

In addition, climate change accelerates the destruction of our environmental heritage and species. Because of global warming, unpredictable weather happens everywhere and ruins the balance of the ecosystem. For example, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is labelled as an endangered species and a global heritage in an emergency, because the bleaching did not stop. Apparently, corals play an important role in sustaining the marine ecosystem. If they extinct, the outcome might threaten on the entire food chain and other marine species would die out. Eventually, the disaster influences human lives. Consequently, we should prevent the climate crisis by implementing aggressive actions.

In conclusion, although climate change is a significant issue that cannot be solved by individuals, I believe that we should actively develop strategies to avoid climate rather than stay along with this catastrophic phenomenon.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified. However, there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Currently, the Government’s spending money has never failed to provoke debates among people. While some people claim the fact that splurging money on space exploration is not justified, the opposite side makes a statement that there are more beneficial tactics. I would contend that the authorities' budget should cash in discovering galaxies while still investing in finding the solution to famine in equal measures.    

Without a shadow of a doubt, exploring space plays such a paramount significant role since it is considered an ultimate key to human existence in the future. Currently, the ever-growing irresponsible actions of people around the world are accelerating day by day, which causes the relentless degradation in Earth’s quality. Consequently, it is necessary for the Government to find a new inhabitable planet in case the earth is destroyed, which is the back-up plan to maintain the human race’s long-term existence. The Mass and the Moon research can be cited as promising examples for practical insights. Hence, it is irrefutable to note that exploring outer space brings a wealth of redeeming features.

On the other hand, there is still a steady stream of urgent problems that need huge financial support from the authorities, especially famine. Apparently, there is a wide range of inhabitants who are suffering from the alarming issue that they do not have adequate food to eat. For example, there is a high death toll in Africa due to starvation. Therefore, it is necessary for the authorities that they should also provide more money to handle the famine. 

In conclusion, it is undeniable that there are some convincing reasons to spend money on technology for galaxy exploration. Meanwhile, the Government needs to take starvation into consideration in equal measures.","### Task Achievement:

Job applicants’ social skills are more important. Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Some recruiters value social skills more than academic qualifications when it comes to assessing candidates. I disapprove of this opinion because our professionals will help us most in handling tasks, and interpersonal ability can be acquired continuously after being employed.

First and foremost, many jobs prioritize your certificates or experience in relevant areas. For example, right at the first round of employment, programmers are required to finish at least a good Bachelor's degree in computer science in order to pass. This is because this type of document reflects clearly your level of problem-solving, critical thinking and understanding of what you're going to do in those positions, otherwise, just being decent in sociability doesn't help you anything in coding or system designing.

My second argument is that people skills can be gained through the working process. For instance, most technological firms in Vietnam often organize seminars or side activities to consolidate their employees' communication and English qualities. By doing so, instead of including conversational potential as a must-have criterion when interviewing, companies can teach their staff later, encouraging them to develop their well-rounded capability to be able to promote themselves to higher positions such as project manager or negotiator, and more than that, it's also the best way to bond every member in the organization together.

To conclude, some employers say that for an applicant, his social qualities are more valuable than his achievements in education. I strongly refute this point of view since the knowledge you obtain from your academy is the most helpful tool to complete your deadlines, as well as people can ongoingly learn soft abilities after joining the companies.","## Task Achievement:

Some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of the population who are aged 15 or younger. What do you think are the current and future effects of this trend for those countries?,"Growing population has become one of the significant issues globally as it can have both positive and negative consequences. In the recent trends, it is observed that in certain countries there is a hike in the count of children who are less than 16 year old. In this essay, I will analyze the feasible effects this growth can bring to the nation at present and future in terms of merits as well as demerits.

To begin with, the pattern observed has its own results in the present. On the positive side, as the number progresses to be high the government is enforced to provide better sanitation facilities for the kids, since the kids are more vulnerable to diseases. This will not only benefit the younger ones but also the adults by providing them with good medical facilities. However, looking at the other side, the public bodies will have to spend more on the resources such as food and education. This can cause a considerable amount of stress for them in terms of financial aspect, which can eventually lead to an increase in the tax collection that affects the public.

Moving further ahead and thinking about the consequences of the future, there will be a good revampment in terms of the nation's infrastructure development in numerous fields including internet, business and health. This is due to the fact that there will be a plethora of educated people with a specialization in a variety of fields. Contradictorily, the more number of educated youths can lead to an adverse situation namely unemployment. As the count of the competent persons in a domain is more, the most skillful ones will end up with a job. So the government needs to plan accordingly to provide employment to all the citizens.

To recapitulate, this essay deals with the various factors that can impact the nations where there is a constant improvement in the population.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that the best way to solve global environment problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The world has been facing a number of worldwide environmental issues. Many people hold the belief that in order to fix those issues a raise in the fuel fare is a must. I personally completely agree with this point of view. This is because the increased rate will push many industries to look for environmental-friendly energy alternatives thus decreasing  pollution, as well as encourage the companies to come up with better pollutants free machinery such as solar energy automobiles. 

The main reason why an increase in fuel cost will eliminate many ecological problems is that many factories and corporations will no longer be able to afford it. Therefore, this will lead  them to use renewable sources of power particularly solar and wind energy. Those resources produce clean energy that does not cause any type of pollution. Additionally, studies have long extolled the drastic decrease in levels of air pollutants in areas where windmills and solar energy panels were installed. 

Further support for my point of view is that with the increase in fuel cost, the companies will invest in coming up with eco-friendly automobiles. A good illustration here is the cars that utilize  solar energy or the ones that work with electrically recharged batteries. According to recent studies due to high fuel expenditures, there is an increasing demand for those eco-friendly cars. Some people are already making the shift from fuel depending cars to more hygienic ones. Thus, companies should seize this opportunity and be encouraged to come up with new solutions and further improve their current productions. 

In conclusion, I reiterate my position that raising the price of fuel will definitely fix many environmental issues. As a result, Industries will use renewable resources to run their factories, and companies will invest in pollutant-free automobiles that will drastically lower the levels of pollution.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that secondary school children should study

international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think

that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think? Give

reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from

your own knowledge or experience.","The potential for the global media to shape the views of today’s youth is considerable. However, while some commentators think that the media has no place in secondary education, other analysts defend the idea that international news should be studied at school. In this essay, I shall examine a number of studies which show that both viewpoints are, to some degree, justified.  

To begin with,  global media undoubtedly enriches teenagers’ understanding of contemporary affairs. This is because television reports provide concise summaries of international affairs. For example, a study run by Oxford sociologists showed that the media heavily influenced teenagers’ knowledge of contemporary affairs. Since any secondary school education would be incomplete without an awareness of such events, it is therefore clear that the media can play a vital role in assisting education. 

On the other hand, many critics argue that teenagers are negatively affected by the global media’s focus on wars and civil unrest. This is because exposure to violence often leads to depression. For instance, recent surveys have discovered that depressed teenagers usually cite the dismal state of the world as a source of their depression. Since mental health is an important objective of secondary education, it is therefore questionable whether the study of international news wouldn’t be a destructive and wasteful use of school resources.  

In conclusion, it should be clear that there are reasons for and against the study of news at school. Thus if media studies are to enter schools in the future, schools will have to think about how negative aspects of the news can be decreased, and positive aspects maximized.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. 
What are the causes of these and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Many countries around the world face the congestion problem, especially in big cities at present. In this essay, I will examine the cause of this issue and the solution which should be done, including the following ,examples will be provided to support my point of view.

 

To begin with, the congestion issues are likely to be seen in a large town or in the Center Business District of some capital cities. The most important reason is the deficient public transport system in order to support inhabitants sufficiently, so more and more people choose to use their own car instead. This is because they are more convenient and do not need to be in crowded areas. To illustrate, according to the latest survey conducted by Bangkok University, it has shown 80% of working-age people in Bangkok, which is the capital city of Thailand, tend to drive their own car for their commute. This is the most important cause of the high volume of traffic.

 

This issue should be tackled by the government in terms of improving the public transportation infrastructure such as increasing the sky train line, adding the number of buses during rush hour or reducing fee costs. This might persuade people to use public transportation more. For instance, according to the latest news, the number of people who use the new sky train line instead of their personal cars is increasing, accounting for 80% since open service. Therefore, improving public transportation infrastructure by the government could reduce traffic problems in some cities or towns.

 

The most significant reason for the congestion problem is not enough public transport facilities, so the government should  tackle this problem by upgrading public transportation services.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"It is a matter of debate that a group of people who support  adolescents have to be available to do unpaid work for the community in their leisure time. from that perspective younger youth get an advantage  as well as the community. I strongly support and agree with this laid statement. my inclination is argued further  in the ensuing paragraphs.

To commence with support, it can be explained that when  younger children meet new people who are elder than them consequently ideas of thoughts get exchanged with them. That's why career-related and the experience as they gain valuable information which helps in the future. ,,moreover if  elderly people  work in a multinational company, so therefore that group of teens get references for finding a job.

In addition, the other view to prove my point is that children learn time management in their life that how all work to do on time. That's why that teenagers becomes responsible in their family, it will help them. apart from that if a scholar child help  poor children in the terms of academic so community get improved. For instance, last year my scholar friend  went to a rural area and taught all poor children throughout  one year. So eventually all weak students got  cleared the board examination due to my friend. So this is the way the community will develop.

Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"The developments of mass media have led to the popularity of advertising. Personally, I believe this phenomenon has both beneficial and detrimental sides.

There are two main benefits of advertisements that I can point out. Firstly, the existing and newly-launched products can both be promoted. Thanks to advertisements, the goods will be widely recognized and earn a reputation through many forms such as commercials, billboards, endorsements, etc... To illustrate the point, the tech giant Apple has successfully applied the posters to advertise their brand new iPhone 13 series products and gained a higher profit by 4% than the previous year. Secondly, customers can also benefit from advertisements’ knowledge. Specifically, commercials can supply all sorts of people with useful information about the goods, for example, regarding healthcare and eating habits. 

Simultaneously, there are still some drawbacks that advertisements bring back. Many of advertisers create misleading impressions of their goods. In reality, their items were of inferior quality but the advertisers exaggerated them for their own interests. For instance, Snapchat used to mislead customers into thinking that pictures disappeared forever. Afterwards, the company was also accused by the FTC of collecting customer data. In addition, advertising can also cause a great burden for the companies.  In other words, to be advertised on TV, businesses have to pay for a huge amount of money.

In conclusion, advertisements can have both  benefits and drawbacks to daily life. From my observation, the companies can advertise for their products but not abuse them.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that technology makes life complex, so we should make our life simpler without using technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is apparent that technology makes things that people do on a daily basis become more complicated; therefore, some people believe that we should get rid of technology in order to simplify our life. Personally, I strongly disapprove of the given statement. In this essay, I am going to cite some of the rationale behind my disagreement. 

On the one hand, it is imprudent to discount the latent drawbacks brought by the advancement of technology. Firstly, the elderly would find it difficult to figure out how the system of technology works as it is quite unusual for them to work with. For instance, old people are used to reading news printed on paper due to its easy approach. Thus, reading news online seems to be too complicated for them. Besides, the high-cost of technological devices is also involved in why people reject using technology. 

Despite the adverse effects mentioned, the superior advantage which technology provides us is undeniable. Mobile phones, to be specific, make life easier not only to communicate but also to store data. Consequently, it is effortless for users to find information with only a phone or computer. In terms of convenience, technology provides us with automation which serves our daily activity such as automatic AC self adjusting its temperature. With that, it actually makes life more simple.

To conclude, I would contend that the benefit of applying technology to daily life clearly outweighs its drawback. Although older generation have contrast view regarding technology, it is safe to say that the world is developing thanks to technology.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think that the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people believe that the main reason for schools is making students good citizens and workers. They claim that the schools are the best places where the children will be grown up as  well-educated and socialized citizens and workers. I support this idea because schools help students become more mature citizens.

Despite the fact that schools have many roles, educational institutions provide the government with agreeable citizens who conform with the government’s tasks. The government of each country needs community members who cooperate with official organizations without conflicts in order to perform governments' tasks. For this reason, since schools are established for public benefits, schools are the best place where governments offer students educations tailored with governments’ tastes. For example, North Korea regime is always brainwashing their children on the education institutions to make them be grown up to be citizens who are agreeable to North Korea government’s policies.

Another reason is that schools produce particular labour that the country needs. Each country struggle with lack of some particular type of highly-trained labours such as health care, IT and atomic engineering. Since schools are the places where massive number of students are taught by just a few of competent educators, schools cultivates pupils with these kind of advanced skills and provides them with country as highly-trained workers efficiently. For instance, Canada decides to support financial aids to the educational institutions in medical parts and promotes their medical policies that the wage of medical labours will be increased by 20 percent to tackle the lack of supply of medical workers.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that educational organizations is responsible for not only growing children tailored with governments, but also offer high quality human resources to society.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Climate change indeed threatens the existence of humankind and the natural world, but some people argue that we should adapt to the changing. In my opinion, I do not support the latter idea because we still have time to tackle the issue, causing less harm to the Earth.
	The first reason why we have to keep our fighting for our planet is that the verge of extinction would impact on many kinds of creatures. In other words, natural habitats have been dangerously threatened with drought, wildfire, and many animals do not have a place to live or food to eat. For example, in Vietnam, the giraffe was a victim to numerous of temperature change, made them not able to continue due to lack of food and pollution from local factories. Due to the loss of these precious animals, the globe may suffer the lack of biological diversity, and it is hard for us to live on as the environment cannot develop without these animals.
	Furthermore, people will take hard lives because of the disaster. It is can be seen that global heating makes the sea level go higher, which means that a lot of cities will have completely covered with water, so they have to shut down. As a result, dwellers will have to immigrate to another area, causing overpopulation. Besides, problems can be also shown as diseases, famine, increased homeless and poverty, and the government cannot always come down with all the issues at once. The price of living with global warming, it is true more horrible and hazardous.

"Some people argue that we should do research into their family history. Others, agree with the view that we should focus on the present and future generations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Researching family background or focusing on the present/future generations is a debatable question. While some people find it useful to understand the background behind an individual, others may think that a person isn't necessarily related to their parents.  Whether this question could be answered or not, it is hard to say, but I support the opinion that we should examine each situation separately. This essay will show both views of this debate and state the final opinion over the arguments provided.

Family history is important in many situations, researching a person's background could be useful to answer some questions. Biologically speaking, your body is completely related to your parents, furthermore, researching on an individual family could be good to understand the probability of a specific disease, baldness or even explain the body structure itself. In addition, wealthiness, especially at young ages, is unfortunately related to the family condition, therefore, an individual economic condition could be explained by its parental history, nevertheless, religious tradition and cultural costumes can also be understood.

Even though the family is a strict bound to the growth of a child, at some point in life the person usually will have the control of their present and future. Imagine an adult with total control over their finances and relationships, despite the place he has lived, he will take the majority of the decisions in his life, as such, researching his past may not be necessary at all.

In conclusion, although sometimes we can identify some benefits from a family's research, in other scenarios the research could be fully ignored. My argument is that we should identify the situation to answer precisely the question, however, neither of those views are right or wrong, instead, they should only be less strict.","## Task Achievement:

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Arguably, it is commented that entities  trading in a specific region should not only be focused on profiting. However,  they should  care for the local communities. Personally, I strongly agree with the view since  enterprises  have responsibilities to  develop neighbourhoods. Although this development is highly criticised by  managers. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and  provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments. 

On the one hand,  businesses are accountable for  the local  district  advancement. In other words,  once they  are exploring  raw materials, lands or other sorts of goods or services inward  communities they should  bear  their expenses. For instance, a Mozambique's company, Mozal is  devoted to aluminium exploitation in the Beluluane area, once it is  making money through the raw material of this  small area, the enterprise builds schools, roadways, and  employs the local  youth. As a result,  both  are the  greater winners, the local folk and  the company. It is the overriding reason for high develop small  lands  in Spain. 

On the other hand,  shareholders regard  social responsibility  as  financial resources consuming.  Because of the escalated  quantity of resources  utilized in  social activities,  the owners of these  institutions  criticise the development.  60% of   business institutions  are found it a hardship  to help  societies where they operate to exemplify. It is pointed out by the new research carried out by the University  of Southampton.  Hence,  there are  soared conflicts between  the  businesses owners and communities.  Moreover, It is the  prime  purpose for the shortfall in an agreement between woodcutters and the African crowd.

To sum up, notwithstanding the lack of support from the shareholders of businesses,  these explorers  should  collaborate  and help  the local livings owing to the fact that they  lately  depend on the local resources.  Therefore, I still strongly agree with the statement. I would go as far as to say, the local regime instils stricter measures to protect throng interests.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In some nations, there are many people attracted to find out about the history of the building where they live. I really agree with this argument because this trend leads to positive impacts for homeowners to know about the capacity and safety of the house from professional analysis.

Learning about designed buildings plays a vital role in configuring the space area and preventing accidents in extreme conditions. Firstly, the strength of the building should be known by the home’s owner to adjust the function of rooms inside the building. It would be a danger, especially for buildings with a second floor or more if the building retains a load over the allowed capacity from the load of furniture, people, and household appliances. Then, it will end with structural failure. In addition, researching on building’s history can be a part of safety management because the owners gain experience with the building’s capacity under natural disasters such as heavy storms, or earthquakes.

On the other hand, the rule of building information can be tracked at the initial plan before it was built. Because of the limitation of knowledge about building design, the history of the building can be assessed by hiring a consultant engineer or contacting the developer, considered professional. As a result, the specialist will decide if the building conditions are still safe and serviceable or not. If it is not confirmed in good condition, the consultant can give some recommendations to maintain the building to be considered a good operation.

Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other while other think that people have become more independent.discuss both views and give your opinion.,"People have different views about whether we are more dependent on each other. While others believe nowadays people are more independent, i think most of the society is dependent on other society.

On the one hand, in ancient part public was too much dependent on rich family and landlord but few decades ago the scenery has been changed. In ,past most   humans are illiterate, so that they are very much dependent on the rich class. But at present majority number of the nation are educated. So that they do the job under private companies or government service. In the modern world community's are not dependent but every single provincial dependent on each other.

So it can be said globally people's are dependent on each other.

public certainly more independent on their personal life.For example, in first-classclass world like the USA, the UK, China, Japan, and many others European country people are much more independent. They can do anything in their personal life without a break the government role. The main reason for this, most of the homey are independent. So common society is totally free. The rich class community can travel anywhere of the world at the same time they can choose their favourite job. Their children are also easygoing.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion?","Study is key of better future while, some people think that higher study is required to achieve a successful career. Although, others believe that it is better way to get a job after completing school. I will discuss both points of view and give my opinion in ensuing paragraphs. 

To being with, there are some reasons for studying at university or college is is best path of successful career. The school teach basic level of subjects. While, in the college and university teach advanced level of perticular subject. So, after completing degree student have vast knowledge of their field. For example, if students get job after diploma they do not have enough knowledge of socially. Such as, how to deal with other people and how to convince about their products or anything else. Whereas, the student get job after degree,they have knowledge in every field. Moreover, nowadays compitition has been increased so students have less skills or knowledge companies do not pay higher.

On the other hand, the student who get the job after school will be ceret some problem when companies give promotion because they do not have any idea to managing team and deal with people. For instance, the survey of times of India shows that the number of children join job after school but they can not apply for higher studies in college and university. As a results, in the near future people have not good education in our country.

In conclusion, the study is most important part of our life when people believe that if children better future and good opportunity they have to enough education and vaild degree. While, others think study is not useful for good job so, thay say that it is better to get a job after school. Therefore, my opinion of the former point of view because education is too important.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think scientific research should focus on solving world health problems. Others think that there are more important issues. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"With the explosion of population, there are a lot of issues that the governments have to concern. While some people argue that academic research should find ways to solve worldwide health problems , many people believe that others issues should be focused on. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view in-depth and present examples to show why the latter assertion is more compelling.

Those who advocate for focusing on health research agree that problems with health are one of the most threatening issues that humans are facing now. After the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, many individuals pay more attention to their health. To have specific treatments for diseases, scientists need to research and test many kinds of medicine before publishing to local people. For instance, scientists and doctors spent more than a year finding suitable vaccines and treatments for patients who were suffering the Covid-19. Moreover, there are many diseases such as cancer could not find any radical treatments to deal with until now.

On the other hand, advocates for prioritizing other issues believe that several problems need to beresearched to find out suitable methods. While patients have doctors to rescue them, many dwellers who experience many kinds of pollutants and overpopulation daily do not have any treatments from the governments.  Otherwise, many problems are overlooked by virtue of the carelessness of the authorities, poverty and illiteracy could be obvious examples. Every issue, in my opinion, needs to have equal treatment from both individuals and the authorities.

In conclusion, while there are many people who believe that health problems should be concentrated on, I concur that scientific research has to discover many methods to solve other issues, allowing for a better society and greater living conditions.","## Task Achievement:

The only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. What extend do you agree or disagree?,"Establishing rigorous punishments for driving violations is the only way to improve safety on our roads. I totally agree with the statement. I believe this approach will lead to fewer offences on the roads.

Viewed from the driver’s side, this approach will raise fear and caution because common people do not want to get any punishment. First, stricter punishments are easily applied on the road. This approach is more corrective action rather than preventive action. Using this approach, the government only focuses on establishing the rule then socializing to citizens. Practically, it will be helped by police or cameras to monitor the offences. This way is easier than increasing the driver's awareness of safety, it will conduct many socialization and workshop events for civilians to raise their awareness of safety.

Second,  Evenless if the punishment is related to a fine, the higher fine will be more scary for most people. This approach will be very effective for common people. Especially in emerging countries with lower economic citizens. Basically they would be more careful to spend their money. The civilian will prioritize their money for primary needs instead of paying the fine.","## Task Achievement:

"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","In most of the nations,biological parents are allowed to decide to send their wards to one-gender institutes or mixed-sex academies.A certain number of individuals believe that pupils learning from single-sex faculties have consequences in future.I partially agrees with this thesis,in my upcoming paragraphs I will discuss both viewpoints and will give my opinion with relevant examples.

On the one hand,pupils those are studying in single-sex schools are more into their studies rather than being in relationships.For instance,in a survey cunducted in 2020, single-sex institutes had more percentage of passed students rather than others.Moreover,many wards are not able to present their real role and their ability of asking questions in front of class full of boys and girls due to their shy nature.Last but not least,mostly pupils are being bullied by the opposite genders like boys are tortuted due to their skinny body and girls due to fashion reasons.

On the other hand,there are some consequences of sending pupils into one-gender faculties such as they will have lack of confidence while talking to other people in there future because they will face both genders at their workplace. In addition,due to less compition wards will stay at one point and will not do more efforts to increase the percentage.For illustration,according to professors,it can be seen that in normal schools,peers with different genders are co-operating with each other and learning things quickly due to compitition.

"In some cites and towns all over the world ,the high volume of traffic is a problem.what are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Travel congestion is a serious issue for urban metropolises around the World. This essay will explain how overconsumption of roads and poor conditions of public transportation can cause the problem and find possible ideas to tackle them.

Nowadays wild range number of people are having their own private car due to it has become more affordable for average consumers and they are no longer a luxury item. 

The first step is to understand why traffic has increased in towns and cities. Broadly speaking, there are three main reasons for this. One is that cars have become more affordable for the average consumers and they are no longer a luxury item, but something that most families expect to own. A second reason is that public transport has become increasingly unreliable in recent years, not least because many bus and train services have been reduced because of the difficulty in funding them. The third reason is that society has, in general, become more mobile and this means more people are prepared to commute to work by car than they were before.

The biggest causes of traffic jam lack of proper road and bridges in cities. If there is an additional way for buses and large trucks in cities, traffic jams reduce in cities.

There is almost certainly no one solution to this problem given the complexity of its causes. However, one option has to be to improve the reliability of public transport to encourage people to take the bus or the train rather than get in the car. It would also be possible to discourage people from driving to work by introducing special tariffs for using the roads, especially during peak periods.

In conclusion, there are a variety of different factors that have led to rising levels of traffic in urban areas. While it may not be possible to find a complete solution but actions should probably involve encouraging more use of public transports.Furtherm","**Task Achievement:**

"As well as making money, businesses should also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that enterprises should undertake social duties in addition to making profits. I completely agree with this viewpoint since they can attract more employees and raise their public image.

The first justification for my agreement is that taking social responsibility can enable firms to entice higher-quality employees. More specifically, qualified staff tend to favor companies that are famous for being socially responsible as the way they treat society potentially reflects the way they treat their workers. In other words, they might consider that their efforts and dedication to their jobs would be appreciated. To illustrate, Vingroup, a Vietnamese corporation, which often allocates huge financial resources for charity work in the community, appeals to numerous workers. According to an in-house survey, one of the main reasons behind their choice to work for it is that it is praised for caring for society.

Another reason why I agree that businesses should undertake their responsibility towards society is that this can boost their image to the public. More specifically, by willingly cooperating with local authorities and inhabitants in preserving the environment or fulfilling other civic duties, they can gain acknowledgement from the community and potentially receive greater support from local people in their commercial activities. For instance, American big-box retailer Target Corp is well known for its social responsibility programs such as donating money to local communities in the form of education grants. As a result, they are given enormous favour from local people, enabling them to raise their sales and further develop their franchise.

In conclusion, I strongly advocate the idea that corporations should be accountable to society as it can allure more people to work for them and promote their brand image. It is advisable that companies engage in social activities to ensure their sustainable growth.

On the one hand, many people claim that leaders are born with a charismatic personality, giving them a considerable advantage over other people. These distinctive personal traits enable people to become naturally good at leading and inspiring others. For example, leaders need to be able to positively influence others, either by their innate charisma or their powerful presence. As these natural abilities are not something that can be obtained over time, those who do not possess them may face difficulty in convincing or motivating others, which may prevent them from becoming inspiring leaders.

On the other hand, other people, including myself, believe that the vast majority of leaders are not born to lead, but prepared to lead. There are many skills relating to leadership that are learnable and achievable, such as communication skills or problem-solving skills. As long as a person receives proper training and puts enough effort into honing these skills, they can also become an effective leader. That is the reason why there are many leadership training programs and courses that aim to train those who want to develop their leadership capabilities. Most people can reap significant rewards from these courses, enabling them to successfully lead others.

In conclusion, it is true that some traits of leadership are likely to be genetic. However, I believe that everybody can become a great leader because leadership consists of a lot of skills that can be learned and developed over time.","## Task Achievement:

"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. 

What are the causes of this?

What actions can be taken to solve this problem","In the recent past, traffic jam is increasing and that leads to problems. This essay will examine the main reasons which are individuals  lifestyle and families size. However the possible solutions are changing in people choices and turning to smallest families. 

People suffering from traffic and the main reason behind this issue would be . Firstly, the population in most countries  are growing due to grow  in the family's size. In the other words, the extended families could be the significant reason because each member will have his / her own car . Secondly, in some countries people prefer using their own vehicles instead of using public transportation because they want to show their level of life although this will affect others live quality's. For instances, a survey done in 2023 at Sultan Qaboos university showed that 80% of Omani citizens use their own car at morning when the are going to work . Therefore, this seems logical that we are facing traffic issue. 

A possible solution to this issue would be increased the awareness between people. If they knows the drawbacks of traffic, they will turn to use the poblic transportation. Next, another solution is encourage people to transfer to small family each family has 2 babies rather than 5 or more childrens this will lead to use less number of cars. Finally, government enforces cars user's to pay a tax if the driver mor than 1000 km daily. Thus, this problem it could be solved if  government and citizens collaborate together.

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Much attention has been drawn to the extent of damage inflicted on the ecosystem by the manufacturing industry. Taking account of the enormous demand for consumer goods in the current market, I suspect the prime cause of the problem lies in the production system itself. From a personal perspective, the best course of action to solve the issue is therefore to explore alternative materials or more eco-friendly manufacturing techniques.

To bring the shortcomings of the production process into sharp focus, it is worth looking at the chemical by-products of the process. Most industrialists labour under a misapprehension that unrestrained economic growth can be achieved without damaging the environment. However, in practice, as more goods are produced, not only has more carbon dioxide being emitted to the air, but more cleaning agents have also leaked into water sources. Moreover, single-use products, most of which are non-biodegradable plastics, have been introduced to accommodate customers’ ever-increasing demands. Discarded easily and being able to remain as wastes for thousands of years, these plastic products find their way into the ocean and threaten marine fauna.

Taking those points into consideration, a plausible solution should be striving towards the usage of more environmentally friendly materials. For instance, Starbucks chains have opted for paper or bamboo straws, as well as cups, as a substitution for plastics. If the initial investment and the maintenance cost of the alternatives are high, which oftentimes are the case, governmental promotion, such as tax breaks or financial incentives can go a long way towards developing more sustainable production practices. Businesses making use of renewable sources of energy, for example, can be subsidized by taxpayers, in contrast with those that use nonrenewable sources. 

In conclusion, the manufacturing sector has taken its toll on the environment due to the concomitant hazardous substances that are subsequently disposed of after the production process. In an attempt to address this issue, going green should be practiced by both the companies and the governments.","## Task Achievement:

Newspapers have influenced people's ideas and opinions. What are the reasons for this? Is this a positive or a negative situation? the reasons for this? Is this a positive or a negative situation?,"In these generations, the public often utilised newspapers to search for truth and understand modern world facts. The newspapers in this modern world have come in digital and physical forms. In the following paragraphs, I will delve into the subjects with some examples by demonstrating my understanding.

Firstly, newspapers are communications tools that are official and trusted by the public. In contrast, people often refer to newspapers to further understand the issues that happened within the community. For instants, public publishers would search for more publications' opinions, with some backup points from the professional before they published their writings in the media, which makes the community  solid ideas about what was happening in society. Likewise, this is a trend that people trusted the newspaper rather than social media. 

On the other hand, some of the publications have more support or sponsors from some organisations or government parties their intentions might influence by their articles and news  published. Hence, in the ,paper they will  focus on a certain topic and argue certain issues towards their opposition,  some of their arguments are making sense but they are picturing  the opposition as the devil and did not critically look at the insight of the issues. As a result, these ideas will influence the reader's ideology towards  society.

"Interviews from the basic selection criteria for last companies. However, some people think that interview is not reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods.
To what extend do you agree or disagree?","Recruiting employees is an essential part of any company. It has been suggested that an interview is not a good process of selecting a new worker when there are better methods available. I strongly disagree with this idea, and in this essay, I will provide some arguments to support my opinion.

Generally speaking, there is a wide range of reasons why people believe that interview is a trustworthy way to recruit an officiary. Firstly, it is the best way to get an idea about the personality and social skills of a worker. If a recruiter does face to face interaction with employees, he will know better about his attitude, communication, and efficiency. A further argument in favour of this idea is that employers will be able to know about the patience of labourers. For example, by asking questions to the interviewee, the interview will know about his traits, such as; ability to handle pressure, confidence, and think out of the box.

However, it must be said that there are two points why people think that other systems are suitable than interviews. Perhaps the strongest of these is that workers can be judged by written tests. If an employee gives the written test, you might be able to learn as regards his theoretical knowledge which is also important for the company. In Addition, group discussion is another better process for electing a man. This is because you will understand them easily whether they are good or not in conversation skills. 

In conclusion, recruiting a better person is a very tough job for the interviewer. However, I feel that the best way to solve this issue is by giving importance to every method. If we judge our newcomers by all processes, we might be able to get our best hand for our company.","## Task Achievement:

Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"Advertisements take up more and more space in daily life. In my opinion, advertisements increasing day by day is a positive development which can lead to improved competition among the companies and to ensure a growing national economy. 

To begin with, there are positive consequences of advertising increasing day by day for companies and customers. Most important development is that this can ensure more competition among the dominant companies in the market. This leads to companies to increase their product diversity and they try to enhance their customer satisfaction. In this way, customers can have a choice of a better product and better purchase. Take some customers, who have some criteria for choosing a product, for example; they can create an attention-grabbing difference in the quality of product as they are picky people. 

Moreover, this can provide positive development for the national economy. Advertisement can encourage the economic growth of businesses in many different sectors.This promotion firstly owns companies' improvement economically that can be through attracting more customers and then it contributes to their industries that more money is in circulation as both production and consumption increase. All of these may lead to economic welfare which can increase employment and can create new job opportunities. In this way, the country's economy has benefited from the positive effect of these.

This essay will discuss the reasons for this phenomenon, and also the possible solutions.

There are two main reasons related to the impact of production to the environment. One of these is because of the lack of environmental regulations to protect the nature. It is well known that our rules do not support all aspects related to the damage caused by production in large scale. For instance, there are numerous industries in São Paulo that through their gabage in the river, and nothing happens. Furthermore, the industries do not invest in developing new technologies to make their processes more efficient, and more environmental friendly.

However, there are solutions to this issue. Firstly, the government should apply more taxes to those companies that do not respect environmental regulations. For example, the rules applied in Brazil are too soft when compared to developed countries like Canada. Another important point is that we should have more aducation actions focused on environmental solutions that would make our industrial process greener. For instance, universities should invest in researches to increase the manufacturing efficiency.

In conclusion, the absence of laws and regulations to protect the nature against the impact of production, and also the lack of technology to improve efficiency, are the key aspects of the problem. Nevertheless, if the government apply regulations focused on environmental actions, and also invest in technology, this situation could be solved.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether the places of museums should entertain people or only educate. In this essay, I will explain both possessions and I am going to tell my belief about this discussion.

The primary factor we need to take into consideration is that museums must be amusing place where people get entertained. First and most importantly museums need to make money. To do that their exhibitions can’t be boring. The workers of this institutions have to figure out how to make their museum stand out from all the others, make it unique to attract visitors. This would led to making bigger profits, which allow to invest into museum facilities also it would help raise workers' wages. The second reason why museums should bring joy, and not only educate is that museums have to be interesting and understandable for people of all ages, especially for children. Getting young people to focus on learning is difficult these days. Therefore, one of the goals of museums must be to combine education with entertainment and teach children, otherwise they will simply be bored and uninterested. In contrast, some others may claim that the only purpose of museums is to educate human beings. Museums reveal to us past events or help us understand other world cultures. We have to respect history and other nations, so depicting these things through an entertainment view would not be mature.

Having considered both views, I think museums need to have balance. I mean it should be enjoyable, entertaining and educational at the same time.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old. Discuss both views and give your opinion. > DISCUSS AND OPINION","Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.

It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.

To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.

In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.","## Task Achievement:

More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people think a solution can be to increase the price of fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Due to the rise of fattening food and the lack of physical exercise, there are numerous residents becoming noticeably obese. Some people, therefore, suggest that the price of fattening food should be increased. From my point of view, I totally agree with both statements.

Overweight can lead to numerous serious diseases. The main reason why the number of people with obesity have been rising rapidly is consuming too much fast food. These days, especially in the urban area,  people tend to eat more junk food because of its convenience, affordable price and deliciousness. However, food such as hamburgers include a large amount of fattening and a lack of fiber and other nutrition. Consequently, this may lead to uncontrollable weight gain. In the long term, your the body will contract some health problems such as stroke, high blood pressure and heart attacks.

To solve the issue mentioned, food prices should be adjusted by the authorities. From my perspective, the price of fattening foods should be raised and the price of healthy food such as vegetables should be decreased by the government to reduce the number of overweight people. Therefore, residents may tend to prefer buying nutritional food rather than junk food and it may lower the overweight people. In the long term, the government can control the number of people who become obese. 

In conclusion, more people are becominge remarkably obese due to fattening from fast food and lack of fiber. The most effective solution can be increasing the price of fattening food.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is true that most of the celebrities are known for their luxurious lifestyles than for their performance or talents these days. Also, many people think that this kind of attitude is not a good example for the young generation. In the following essay, I will express my agreement and also disagreement. 

On the one hand, it is a fact that many famous people become popular due to their fancy lifestyle, instead of their outstanding achievement these days. Their acting talent might be standard or below the average, but they are making sensation to the public by showing their wealth and glamorous lifestyles. For instance, would be Kamal R Khan, whose luxurious mansion, party and views on other celebrities are more famous than his acting. It is believed that the behaviour would be a negative influence for the young people as it teaches them about hedonistic lifestyle.

On the other hand, there are people who have shown to the world that they have reached success due to strong determination and hard work. One of the famous Brazilian athlete once said – “Success is not accidental. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, sacrifice and love of what you are doing”. For example, would be the legendary Nawazzudin Sidique. His career from National School Drama to Bollywood will always be an inspiration for many struggling actors. These kinds of celebrities are worth to be followed by the young generation.

"Topic: These days there are a lot of TV channels available to view. Some
people think it is good to have a range of options but others argue that it
affects the quality of programs.
Discuss both sides and give your opinion as well.","The increase in the number of TV channels has provoked a critical controversy over if these variety is valuable and provide a broad spectrum of chances for people to select, or this increase in quantity is accompaned with poor content.From my perspective, many of satalite programs and showes now have very low quality, despite the tremendous which is on the surface nowadays.

On the one hand, many people aurge that the approach of variety and huge number of programs gives those who watch TV the ability to choose freely bteween movis, talkshows, news, or even crtoon. Not only this, even in the same category there is specificialty, like different types of films' channels, while one is restricted for action, the other is limited to comedy. Also those people stand on the side of variety as the thought that highten people's intellect by huge amount of information about different aspects in life, such as scientific, sports and current world news.

However, I can see that these ideas are flawed owing to superfacial as well as directed thoughts they provide, programs' maneger are usually aiming to enforce their points of view on the viewer, to attract many observers to his side no matter they offer the truth or not. For instance, those who take the side of governement and encourage what they do all the time, while others who judge the behaviours of countries' presidents at any stage even at important and critical events that need all the citizens to be one hand.

"as well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Looking at the world it is clear that we have more successful companies than ever. While many people believe that these companies are solely responsible for maximizing  profit, my view is that they are subjected to other social obligations as well.

In fact, many stakeholders would be suffering if corporations only cared about the revenue that they earn. Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see that certain greedy firms often exploit their employees by offering lower-than-average salaries to novice students, resulting in young working adults cannot afford decent accommodation, transportation, and healthcare, which is the reason why we have a such low birthrate. Therefore, on top of an attractive balance sheet, CEOs also need to treat their workers in a humanitarian way.

Likewise, the externality of enterprises should also be taken into consideration. Consider fast food brands such as Pepsi, KFC, and  Popeyes, all of which are causing severe health problems like diabetes, obesity, and even cardiovascular diseases. Yet, a major proportion of investors choose to ignore this fact since these big names usually generate a solid rate of return. Hence, organizations that pose a threat to society need to spend more time on minimizing the damages that they caused although they are financially successful.

Those who harbour the view that enterprises are not entitled to any social events may argue that they have limited budgets. Indeed, companies can only contribute something positive to the public when they have a surplus. However, rather than donating millions of dollars, they can always participate in social activities by providing unpaid work. This seems like a reasonable compromise.

In conclusion, big firms not only ought to boost the economy but also play a vital role in promoting social welfare. Only by doing so can we have a better commercial atmosphere for everyone.","## Task Achievement:

More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people say that the price increase of fattening foods will solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Obesity issue has become a major problem to the society these days. Adults and even toddlers are becoming hazardously obese to the point, that it affects their health. The government proclaimed that an upsurge in the price of the unhealthy food will curb this serious problem. Unfortunately, I strongly disagree the hike in the price on those food products will only affect to people in need and doesn’t resolve the problem.
Overeating is one of the fundamental issues that almost all obese person faced. Current studies have been shown that the best ways to keep body fit and healthy are to exercise and proper balanced meal. Eating healthy food may help to lose weight, though it must be eaten in a considerable amount. Ironically, overindulging on nutritious food can lead to weight gain and possibly even detrimental to health. 
Moreover, increase in price on food such as butter and dairy products, affect towards restaurants owners and low-incomed family. Restaurant and bakery require to by a lot of dairy products, sugar and salt to make meals and this implementation will only affect their business’s sales. Furthermore, it will only make the situation worse for low-income family as it is already a struggle for them to have a decent meal. Despite of the implementation, the target group, however, will continue to purchase those ingredients as they couldn’t control their eating habit.
In conclusion, it is a matter of fact that the increment in the food price doesn’t prevent obesity problem for growing. Self-control during eating and exercise are the best options for these people to lose their weight effectively.

Women are gifted with patience, kindness and resilience. Women are not only emotionally strong but meticulous at their work, which  in turn, demands a lot of devotion both in terms of time and energy.

Nowdays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of the news. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.,"A growing number of people are adopting modern technology to socialize. However ,this practice brings about a mix beg of both and bane. This essay will discuss two of the main driving forces behind this behaviour and the main reason why I believe it is mostly a negative trend.

  Firstly,It is reasonable to assume that one of the main driving forces behind the rise in online socializing is the advantage of social media in the last two decades. Digital natives have grown up being able to communicate with people from all over the world through direct messages,photos,voice chat and video. This has arguably shaped the way they internet and has shifted more of their social connections online. In addition to the influence of social myriad populations have had to deal with unprecedented situations such as the 2008 financial crisis or the more recent COVID-19 pandemic. While the 2008 financial crisis led to many young folks being unable to find work and spending extended periods of time at home. The covid 19 left much of the world's population effectively housebound for weeks and in some cases, months on end. This means that the public had to adopt socializing online. 

  Although, there are many benefits to socializing online and it has proven to be highly advantageous in extreme situations. It is mostly a negative trend when it is overused in my opinion. For starters, cyberbullying is a major threat to the well-being of both children and adolescents. Cybercrime occurs on a regular basis on platforms namely Instagram and Facebook. In addition, the rate of  suicide among teenagers is arguably on the rise as a result of this phenomenon. Along with that, the young population who interact virtually have fewer opportunities to practice their interpersonal skills. Users are increasingly texting  one another on Facebook rather than communicating in person. This can lead to anti-social behaviour and depression.

 In conclusion, socializing online,   If it is being overused can affect young folk's mental health as well as their quality of life. This is why I believe the virtual interpretation is mostly detrimental.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many people have stated that we should search for strategies to live with climate change without fixing it. I fully disagree with this idea and for this essay will examine the reasons that can prove this statement is not right.

First of all, Climate change can cause the huge damage on animals such as extinction and lack of places to live because due to climate change the world is getting hotter and most water bodies are drying so there are not many places for water animals to live. Even, for animals which live on tree because of burning forest it does not have many places for them to live and it can lead to extinction. For instance, For polar bears, they live only in cold place such as pole but most of the coldest places are melting and it can create a huge impact of losing polar bears in the future. Climate change is the biggest reason of why many animals have extincted.

Secondly, There are many problems for the Earth in the future if we do not fix it now because climate change can cause many serious problem only if we keep on trying to living through it without finding a way to help the Earth. Nowadays, there are many serious problems that have damaged the world already if more problems to come, it can affect humans and animals even more. For example, Climate change changes the weather to hotter. In addition, In 2019, there was a burning fire in Australia and it killed a lot of trees, plants and many living animals that can lead to many more problems such as extinction of koalas and the increasing of toxic smoke. Another way to say that many problems are ready to arrive and damage us all if we do not find a way.

Housing shortages in big cities can cause severe social consequences. Some people think only  government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, the increasing population has caused trouble in purchasing lands. On the one hand,  the society argues the fact that authorities should make remedy actions to fix an issue of inadequate  residences. However, on other hand, people themselves should solve this issue. I partially agree  with the given statement, and I will provide the substantiate argument in upcoming  paragraphs.  To commence, the government should restrict the allocation of land. To put it another way, government should apply more taxes to real estate so that they limit the making of houses.  Moreover, a focus on vertical housing would help to resolve the issue of even distribution of  homes. As an illustration, the apartments, and townhouses in developed cities like Singapore,  are made in a vertical manner in limited areas. Furthermore, authorities should apply more taxes  to bungalows and large houses. Therefore, people would purchase less of them. As an example,  the Canadian government restrict the purchase of houses for two years to resolve the issue of housing shortage.  On a contrary, people could also solve this issue by themselves. To simplify, they should prefer  living in villages and outskirts of towns instead of living in bigger cities. People can find more job  opportunities like farming in villages to earn a livelihood. This would help in bringing more  employment in the country and in this manner, society could also develop the villages. The fresh air  of villages would also make people more healthy and less stressed. Therefore, it would reduce  crimes in society.  To conclude, although people move to metropolitan cities in search of better opportunities,  they still face residential issues. Therefore, it is the responsibility of both government and people to resolve the issue by encouraging people to live in vertical housing and villages.","## Task Achievement:

Most of the urgent problems can only be solved with international cooperation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the process of learning history, some curricula need to be included to confirm that the students gain expertise. The argument is divided into two perspectives, whether the importance of local history or world history. In my opinion, both of them have the same merits, and this essay will explain them in detail based on experience.

Learning local history leads the students to know about the best practices used by their founders to rule the nations with the state systems and become developed countries. The students need to see this subject because, in the future, every nation will face some uncertainty problems where the decisions created by their founders could be considered to solve those problems in the future problem. For example, in Indonesia, the state systems have changed from the colonialization era to the new order era. At present, Indonesia has a stable system and is a democratic nation. Therefore, learning history is really important for students because they will be decision-makers for their countries.

On the other hand, learning international history also significantly impacts students in the middle of the globalization era. The student will know that some nations create bilateral or multilateral agreements with other countries because there is only a nation that can stand up to be a developed country with support from other nations in terms of exchanging knowledge in economy, technology, education, health, etc, 

In conclusion, the statement to learn local and world history is essential. While the knowledge to rule the country by the policy will be taken from this subject, the experience of why the country becomes a a developed country needs needs to be known by the student to increase ability as a decision-maker in the middle of globalization.","### Task Achievement:

To commence with, there are two main benefits to complete the job by machinery. Firstly, it helps to enhance the production by using instruments.  To elaborate it, owners prefer to use machinery to increase manufacturing capacity which leads to keep the making cost down.

More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people suggest that the solution to this problem is to increase the price of  fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In this contemporary society, obesity is considered a global issue because of its consequences among all age groups. A large section of society claims a rise in the cost of junk food should solve this concern. This essay supports the assertion to a major extent despite some reasons such as due to a busy schedule.

 To begin with, increasing the price of fattening cooking can discourage individuals from purchasing the product, and as a result, this can reduce consumption.

The best illustration as educational campaigns and fitness programs can help people  maintain their fitness as well as diet and also address the issue of junk feed roots.

Another perspective is, home home-cooked food is valuable. In today's fast-paced world, the community often do not have the time or energy to cook at home and prefers to grab meals from outside. However, this can lead to health issues, including obesity. Fast snacks and other take-out options may be convenient, but they are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, and added sugars.

On the one hand, the increasing price of fattening foods might be a solution so that people would not tend to buy the expensive fattening food. They might think that to eat fattening foods needed maximal effort in the context of gaining money. The pricey fattening foods could also make the society become to prefer eat non high-fat foods so that they consume other nutrient components along with avoided by fatty foods. It could appeared an awareness about fattening foods.   

On the other hand, not all overweight people are poor, that is why this is not an effective method. Moreover, fat foods are also needed for some people who have underweight and not all of them are rich, it will cause the new problem, which called social-economic gap. In addition, either the obesity or overweight people could diet if they have the motivation for being ideal itself. For instance, an overweight person still try to make a lot of money to have the pricey fattening food as they want unless they have an intention for reducing their weight. Other methods that should be applied are the campaign of healthy lifestyle, such as exercise regularly, food diet, and so on.

In spite of its popularity, some people strongly believe that use of robots may have some negative effects on humanity in the future. In my way of thinking, it is the best thing that scientists have ever invented and there are no certain doubts that it will be one of the most crucial things in every industry.

To what extend do you agree?","Recently, there have been arguments that to go to single-sex schools bring more demerits than go to co-educational schools which is in the parents hands to decide which choose in several countries. I partially agree with this statements because of two reasons.

Firstly, there are so many reasons why the parents deicide to go to single-sex schools for children such as, the child who has some disadvantages when relate with girls due to traumatized or something. In this case, it is difficult to go to a co-educational school by the child. Moreover, children are possible to consantration more about study because there are no relationships with other genders.

"In cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Needless to say, we are witnessing an alarming trend of  car over-usage. Starting from small towns to the metropolises, they are all full of an excessive number of vehicles on their roads.

In addition, in order to find an alternative , the option most avid drivers would consider switching to a bicycle, which certainly ensures the lack of potentially appalling traffic.

"Some people argue that we should do research into their family history. Others, agree with the view that we should focus on the present and future generations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","One school of thought holds that people should research their family roots as the best way to create a meaningful study, whereas others believe that concentrating on the present and later offspring is a better option. This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding that I am in favour of the latter notion.

On the one hand, some individuals should study their ancestry origin due to a variety of factors. First, it must be affirmed that each person has his or her roots, a place called hometown, and a reason to be born, consequently, this exploration helps them to better understand their origin. It is really practical compared to the studies that are somewhat macroscopic and some of its contents that are vague and unverified. In addition, if parents deeply understand ancestry traditions, they will become an encyclopedia helping their offsprings understand their ancestor's origins. This knowledge, as a historical demonstration of each parentage, is summarized to help their descendants approach as quickly as possible. For instance, parents can help their sons and daughters understand their ancestor's history through brief stories every night before they are going to bed.

On the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons why I am convinced that it is more beneficial to focus on succeeding generations. One reason is that children are the future of each parentage, the prosperity or survival of each family depends on their offspring. Therefore, parents need plans to orient their children to overcome upcoming difficulties and challenges. For example, the major Korean Cheabol Groups such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai are very focused on training their children to become heirs to the family. Their descendants all go through an extremely harsh training and learning process to have forthcoming success, as Lee Jae-Yong - the current President of Samsung is a typical example. Another reason is that in the macro aspect, descendants are the factors that help their own country develop and compete with other countries, as a result, focusing on their education is more important than anything else.

In conclusion, while it is irrefutable that people could research their roots without any consideration for others, I would contend that it should be limited and focus on the next generations because of their indispensable influences on human's future.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views.","Right after finishing high school, teenagers often wonder whether they should continue their education or get a job. While many believe studying at a college or university will be the best way to guarantee a successful career, others claim that working straight after school is a better option.

Start working straight after graduation is beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, young people can start earning money as soon as possible by working. As a result, they will be mature enough and able to live independently on their income. Secondly, a person who decides to look for a job rather than pursue higher education will likely have a chance to obtain a lot of real experience and practical skills. This may lead them to progress more quickly in their chosen profession.

On the other hand, some argue that it is more beneficial for young people to continue their studies after high school. Firstly, a college education prepares students to meet academic qualifications, which most employers require nowadays. Consequently, university graduates have opportunities to earn higher salaries than those without qualifications. In addition, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive since hundreds of applicants often chase one position in an organization. Having a degree is an obvious advantage that university graduates have. In many countries, students who graduate with an engineering degree are highly paid and have an easy time getting a good job.

"Many people believe that modern music can have a negative impact on the young. Others believe the effect of modern music is positive.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","A commonly held belief is that music of the 21st century is harmful to children due to its lyrics and negative messages. However, there is an opposing argument which claims that music can have a positive influence over the new generation. In this essay, I am going to elaborate on both opinions and show why I approve modern music.

To begin with, it is well-known that music has always had a powerful impact. Since ancient times it has been changing the way people think. Older people still consider present-day songs being detrimental for a child to listen to them. This is because composers and songwriters include too much violence and other inappropriate behaviours in their lyrics in the recent decade.

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do the advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In my opinion, the given statement stands partially true. Many of the married members of any family, prefer to have children at their early ages. Over the period, the decisions are changed. There could be many reasons for taking such decisions. For example, the raise in the cost of living. Due to increased prices of all the basic needs, people are finding it difficult in raising them, providing them the basic education, and taking care of them.

I believe this is the major reason behind taking such decision. Talking about the advantages and disadvantages, there is a wide scope for advantages being outweighed.

Planning for children after certain period of time, from the marriage day, it gives the couple/family a lot of time, to think about the future. Also in laying a path for their (children) lives. Parents will be able to plan according to their financial status, balancing the requirements. It given an advantage of planning their education, the best institution to chose, and also a strong support with some savings made.

Talking about the disadvantages of having children at early age, it becomes a big challenge in taking up such big responsibility. One should become more stabalized in terms of finance, and ready to spend a lot on education and other expenses.

Being a family of 5 members, with 2 siblings, I really found it very difficult for my parents in rising us. Since, they were not financially stable, and they had to make many debts for providing us all the basic needs like clothes, shelter (rented house), education fee, etc. It took them almost 20 years for them to clear all those debts.

"Some people think parents should read or tell stories to children. Others think parents needn’t do that as children can read books or watch TV, movies by themselves. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","Parents are the first teachers to their kids,it is commonly believed that,storytelling by parents is really important.But others argue that reading books and watching television can be done by the youngsters and parental intervention is not required.In this essay,I am going to discuss both the views and share my personal opinion.

Parents are the first persons who spend more time with children than anyone else.So,during the course of childhood,if parents are telling the stories taking some time out from their hectic life,children will be motivated towards the good manners and they will carry it when they grow.Furthermore,apart from morality,the connectivity between the parents and children will become efficient which creates a lot of positivity in the children.For example,students who spent their childhood with parents behave well in school and on the other hand,youngers who did not spend their time with their parents act oddly.

It is also argued that,nowadays,children are capable enough to manage their work,including,reading books,watching television of their choice like cartoons or movies.If the parental involvement is missing during the schooling then it may lead to several negative paths on the children.In other words,children give importance to television than parents.For an instance,a past survey,reveals that more than 60 percent of children prefer to spend their time in front of the televison by enjoying their favourite program than seeing their mother or father.

In a conclusion,parents killing time with the children is very important for their children personal growth rather than allowing them to do their activities on their own.It is also suggested that,the more time parents spend with children in teaching them stories,the more good manners their children learn.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued that the teenagers should contribute to help the community with unpaid work, since it would be benefit both. It is a very common thought that this type of contribute could help to educate the teenagers.  However, I strongly disagree with this point of view, as I believe that each job should be paid and free time is an important resource for the teenagers.

Firstly of all, a person who works has the right to be paid for their time. This is because the economic situation is not so good for several families and most of them has already started to work to help their family, such as pay the bills, pay the rent or the books to study. For example, I have started to work at the age of 16 years old to buy my scholarly books and help my family with other expenses. Without a job it would be impossible for me to attend the school.

Secondly, almost all teenagers attend the school. In other words, this means that grand part of their time is dedicated to the study and their free time is an important part to improve their mental health and reduce the stress. For instance, many doctors think the sports as whole help the students to increase the concentration.

To sum up, I think the work is an optimal instrument to help our teenagers to understand how works the life and to help them to realize their dreams.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Museums have had been playing a significant role to magnify the glory of a nation along with serving educational purposes. A segment of society opines that the sole aim of museums is to entertain folks; diametrically opposed to this, others believe that these places are more useful in imparting invaluable cultural value to the young generation. Both statements may advance equally compelling arguments, but I inclined the second notion for the reasons which are explained in the following paragraphs.

First and foremost, museums are the buildings that hold  invaluable information regarding the ancient era of human civilisation. How the human species have had been evolved from the first phase of the life cycle is clearly depicted in this architecture with pictures. For instance, the national museum Delhi has diverse articles from the magnificent ancient era including the statues of the kings of that period and their accessories like jewellery and clothes. Thereby, apparent visuals of these articles longer last than reading; these structures are the source of knowledge for those who are keen on exploring history.

Moving further, thanks to globalisation, it is easy to travel and investigate  other countries around the globe. The popularity of these monuments attract  tourists, therefore it would be cooler if these buildings have  modern amenities like air-conditioned halls and better visibility of the accessories, safe security system where children can roam and enjoy themselves to the fullest with their parents.

To conclude then, whilst there exist contrasting stances on the matter, it is taxing work to decide which one have a more positive outcome, howbeit, undoubtedly, museums are the prime source of ancient cultures and can upgrade the youngsters with the history, but it would be impeccable if these buildings have offered some entertainment along with a safe environment to the sightseers.","### Task Achievement:

Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"It is often argued that a paramount proportion of young people who study at secondary schools are finding it more challenging to focus on tuition nowadays.While there are a number of negative consequences of this trend,those and government can be able to address this question in turn.

      It is true that it is becoming  tougher  day to day studying school for young ones due to several reasons .The first reason is that development of modern manufactured technologies as well as various social medias ,which usually cause to distract pupils while they are in the class.For example, in the United Kingdom some student are suffering from the intrupting of their classmates while they are doing exercises during the lesson .Their piers makes them to watch different videos on their smartphones that are not suitable for their ages.As a result many children obsessed with playing many terrible games on cell phones such as PUBG is known as interesting game for young ones to play on numerous platforms  lead children to enter hazardous ways during their lives.

       On the other hand ,there are a plethora of steps that could be taken by individuals and government to solve the obstacles.To commence with, parents who their children are educating at schools play an important role in this case .Primarily because,They purchase the most expensive and the latest made phones for their children regardless of their ages and also this means that it is the biggest mistake to some extend,which parents made.It is crucial reason that after they give the phones for young ones,children should be controlled per day what they are watching or playing on smartphones.In addition ,to tackle this issue behaviors of kids also play a significant role.As a result it needs to be done by government that new laws should be produced for kids to study in school without bringing phones.

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.


Discuss both views and give your opinion


Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. 


You should write at least 250 words.","There is a highly controversial issue relates to whether it is vital for children to learn art or not. In this essay, I will examine this question from both points of view and then give my own opinion.

On one side of the argument, there are many people who argue that art is an important subject for children to learn at school. The main reason why they hold this belief is because art can foster children’s creativity which is very fundamental to children’s career prospects. In order words, through drawing and painting, youngsters can develop creative thinking which can be applied in any fields of careers in the future. Hence, they could be very successful in their professions thanks to high level of creativity. For example, currently I am an English teacher of young children. Teaching children English, I have to be very creative enough to draw pictures to illustrate new vocabulary on the board every day. I see that my drawings and creativity were developed thanks to previous art lessons when I was in primary school.

On the other hand, it is also possible to make the opposing case. It is often claimed that joining  lessons of art at school is such a waste of time. People often have this opinion because art is not a compulsory element of many professions from which people can get high salaries. Nowadays, most of parents do not want their children to become artists, but professionals such as doctors or employees in Information Technology so that they can have high income. Hence, those parents do not want their children to spend time on art subject which is not important to their future careers. Instead, they force their children to make use of their time to study subjects that are helpful and directly related to their orentied professions in the future. 

In conclusion, I believe both points of view have their own merits. On balance, however, I feel that it is crucial for children to participate in lessons of art at school because it can help children improve their creativity which is a vital ability to get success in the future.","## Task Achievement:

"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In contemporary society, some people think that wealth is the main factor which makes it possible for individuals' well-being, but others argue this idea. Therefore, although some nations are already rich and bring about the addition of economic wealth which increases, citizens in the countries do not feel more satisfied. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversy, and my opinion will be provided.

On the one hand, advocates of this perspective believe that even if arises  stable finance in nations that are already rich, it does not help the population in this country be more pleased. It is clear that economics is not a major determiner that allows people to pleasure in living. In other words, some regions may lack a variety of conveniences such as amusements, transport, and other facilities.

On the other hand, those against the idea of people in the rich countries feel that are not satisfied, despite  additional increases in finance. The reason is that the more there is budget in the countries, the more there is comfortable living because the budget is a foundation of development. Furthermore, the government will spend this fund on the generation of places which satisfy individuals, and they can provide a lot of supplies such as food and materials. As a result, the high-income regions can bring about benefits for citizens.

Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them,"is undoubtable that the majority of the brands around the world will advertise their products in the television as well as billboards. in this essay, I shall further elaborate my point of view by analysing this particular issue.

Generally speaking, we are surrounded by advertisements in our daily life. Perhaps, one of the greatest sources of such promotion is from the mass media, for instance, newspaper, television as well as the internet. One important point to be made is superstars are hired by the branding company as an ambassador to promote their products. If one idolise this superstar, they will purchase the product endorsed by them. Another related matter is cigarette is often used as a prop in movies and drama. Whilst smoking is regarded as deleterious o one’s health, youngsters will however smoke for the purpose of imitating their idol. In short, advertisement is considered as a strong method to attract buyers.

Despite many advertisements are aired and printed freely, measures should be taken to avoid consumers being exploited. First and foremost, legislation about the contents of advertisement should be created. This is clearly important as many companies tend to promote products which are disadvantages to consumers, such as cigarette. Another point to note is the law should state the advertisers must be honest in terms of the quality of the product or brand which they sell.

In a nutshell, it is evident that advertisements have made a great impact on consumers, not least because people would purchase the items advertised on the television and endorsed by superstar. This is however, must be control through legislation in order to protect the consumer’s right and safety.","## Task Achievement:

Some people feel that in order to improve the quality of our education we should encourage high school students to evaluate and criticise their teachers. Others feel that it will cause the loss of respect and discipline in the classroom,"It is stated by some people that pushing the learning wheel to the top depends on students' assessment to their instructors, whereas others emphasize that respecting teachers is  a priority to the  teaching-learning process.I firmly approbate the latter camp.

First and foremost,criticising lecturers will lead to various problems such as messy classes and a lack of respect. That is to say, if students do not admire and honour their monitor,they will not be able to learn any subject by them. For example, learners  in upper grades can not learn math,science and artificial intteligience at school if the teacher does not have class-mangement or he/she can not make students listen or follow up with the lesson. Thus, accepting rude comments  will lead to out-of-control tutition as well as desortation of respectable image of teacher. 

On the other hand, evaluting teachers could be one aspect of teaching ,yet it should be taken as a holistic evaluation containg parts such as: parents,administration and students.Moreover,this evalution should be conducted professionally and without any bias criterian .The most impotant point is to deal with criticisim as a factor to motivalte teacher not  as a mean of offense  and humilitation. For instance, principles may attend demo-presentation and scofold teachers to overcome any difficulty or deficiency tactfully and kindly as well, focusing on positive features first.

"In some countries, people are having children at later age in life. What are the reasons? Do the advantage outweigh disadvantages?","In today's world childbirth is a huge problem for most women.Individuals are more inclined towards making their career than on giving birth to a child.Adapting this method has more negative impacts than positive.

Firstly, the reproductive age of a woman lies between 14yrs to 40yrs.Focusing on late childbirth has caused a rise in the infertility rate.Women undergo menopause early so they need to conceive early.Late born child brings many risks to the mother like,physical weakness and mental depression.

For instance,it has been reported that women are developing many obstetric and gynaecological problems as their age advances.PCOS, has been reported as the most common cause of infertility with advancing age,so doctors are recommending parents plan their family early to avoid such issues.

On the ,contrary there are some advantages of late pregnancy.Girls should not be forced to marry early instead they should be encouraged to study further and become independent.In doing so they will be capable of looking after their kids and giving them a bright future.For example,many individuals who have persuaded their higher degrees and then married have been shown to give a healthy and good life to their future kids.

To conclude,although the merits of late birthing is completing their studies but we cannot ignore the demerits it brings and its number has been enormously increasing.The biggest threat it causes risks to the mother and many women become infertile by the time they even think of becoming a parent.In my ,opinion women should plan early to become parents than to wait till they become independent.","### Task Achievement:

some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There can be little doubt that the only way to solve the world's environmental problems is to put fuel at a higher amount is a major concern in many societies in the world. This writer argues that there are many ways to feature cut rather than this because this can change the community's lifestyles and make a rush of the economy in many nations.

A crucial reason for the problem of making a difference in people's daily lives. This is due to the fact that the charge of living will increase directly and facing up with many taxes and bills. As a result, this makes society's life harder, and this leads to the food and drinks change, so many families need to save up and use fewer vehicles just for some important things to do. Therefore, it is advisable that increasing the charge of fuel brings many negative effects on the public's lives.

Many rushes from many countries are another point worth considering. It is vital to understand that governments will get in trouble with transportation, trading, education and especially for  food and drinks. Many businesses need to close down and have the intention of moving to something brand new owing to the non-profit of selling stuff. In this context, it is not difficult to understand why  this not making the environment better, just getting worse and will cause potential struggles.

Taking all points into account, transportation, price tag of living and all the stuff we need will make things not change much and this can encourage and give many opportunities for society to develop the country.

"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession, what factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opnion, should be done about it? 2","Nowadays, it’s undeniable that you must work hard to get a job, many university graduates can’t find work in their chosen profession. This essay will discuss the main cause. In addition, it will suggest a suitable solution to this problem.

The primary main cause is companies hire foreigners to give them a low income. In other words, a lot of organizations hire people from outside their country rather than hiring a person from your own country because of the cheap salary they give to foreigners. For example, many reporters say that the percentage of companies who are hiring foreigners is nearly 80% because of the low salary that foreigners ask for. Although some companies hire people from outside their country, the government should make a rule that you have to hire people from your country.

The viable solution to this problem is that the government should launch a publicity campaign in the media to hire graduates from your own country. In other words, many organizations hire individuals from outside their country. The awareness campaign should shed some light to hire graduates from your own country. For example, Japan started a campaign to stimulate companies to hire from their own country this calling positively impacted the Japanese. 

To conclude, this essay highlighted the main cause which is hiring foreigners.

"Some people believe teenagers should be required to do unpaid community
work in their free time. This can benefit the teenagers and the community as well.
Do you agree or disagree with this point of view? Share personal examples if
applicable.","For the betterment of society and youngsters, some people feel that youngsters should spare their leisure time by doing unpaid community work. I completely agree with this point and in this essay I will support my view with example.
One of the most significant benefits of teenager's involvement in social work is increasing their level of awareness of social issues. Young people mostly unaware of communal problems so if they enrolled themselves for free social work then they will realise the gravity of particular problem and also could be able to provide a piece of advice. For instance, I worked for the NGO from Pune, India formed by college-going students and took volunteer participation in clean Narmada river program. Thus, as per my experience, I feel that to develop adolescents’ likings in community work, people should encourage them.
Furthermore, spending free time in engaging communal activities would develop teenager's interest in politics, social work, and public sector services. The reason for this is, nowadays, most of the children spend their spare time by watching some TV programs or by playing computer games. If they start investing that time doing community tasks, they might start thinking to become a politician or a social worker or a public service agent to help community grow faster. To illustrate this point, students from Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) fought for Maharashtra state assembly election last year and got unbelievable response from public as they have done tremendous social work before.","## Task Achievement:

"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people store knowledge on the internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","In this day and age, more and more people opt for obtaining knowledge on the internet instead of storing knowledge in books. This has many merits and demerits. I am firmly convinced that using the internet to access knowledge has more merits than demerits.

On the one hand, using the internet to get information and knowledge has several/certain downsides. First, some information and knowledge are only published in the form of paper books. As a result, it can be difficult for people who only use e-books to access this information. For instance, series of books such as Story Central do not have ebooks, so they must be bought in stores. Second, there is lots of false information on the internet. The main reason for this is that online information is not usually censored. As a consequence, readers can fall victim to false information and may be deceived.

On the other hand, it is my firm belief that the upsides of storing knowledge on the internet are more significant. To begin with, searching for information on the internet is more convenient than looking for knowledge in books. People just need a phone or laptop with internet connection to access online information whenever they want. Moreover, the price of e-books is generally lower than that of paper books. This is mainly because the price of traditional books includes the cost for paper, transportation and storage. Therefore, it may be more economical for readers to use paper books.

"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession.What factor may have caused this situation and what in your opinion, should be done it.","University graduates are dreaming to get an occupation in line with their chosen profession. They hope by enrolling in university will help their professional career in the future. However, in reality it is hard for them to meet their professional expectations. In this essay, I will describe factors that may lead to this situation.

Firstly, it is because of the limited experiences that they have. Experiences explained here not only talk about work but also others experiences such as organizational, group activities, and all works related to campus. This might happen because in university, scholars tend to have their own choice of education courses. Then, sometimes they choose not to be involved in any other projects or organizations because it might be helpful for them to focus on subject matters only. By doing so, they do not realize that all activities outside campus give them points plus to add into their curriculum vitae which is necessary in time ahead. In my opinion, In order to avoid this situation, it is very crucial for universities to make mandatory program activities not only about working but also organizations such as internship, exchange students so that undergraduates must participate actively. Hence, when they finish their school they definitely have experiences in their resume.

Secondly, getting a job for recent graduates is very competitive. It is simply because every year the universities produce workforces and the company available is limited. Hence, I think it is better for the university to have some entrepreneur programs offered in order to prepare the sophomore to think not only about having employment but also to open business to the public. Indeed, it will create a job market for everyone and to increase economic activities in a country.

Finally, universities need to offer various programs to boost careers for students. Since the graduates lack experience in the working field, they need to prepare for it.","## Task Achievement:

"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.
To what extent do you agree?","childhood at school has been a part of life which everybody cherishes and admires, as it often involves memories of fellow classmates and them having fun and doing all sorts of shenanigans, Although while being a kid your classmates being a boy or a girl does not matter  this can have some issues as the individual grows and in my ,opinion same-sex schools do lead to some disadvantages which are face by both genders irrespectively. 

The main problem that this type of educational institution create is a lack of understanding of the opposite sex and also a lack of confidence, consider an example of a boy studying for 5 recent years of his life in the company of other boys, he shall develop more confidence in talking to another guy but will hesitate if he has to converse with a random girl, as he will be out of practice. It also affects the children in not knowing the preferences of other genders in different situations, such as 

not being aware of being a little gentle and well-behaved while talking to a female . If all these ideas have dwelled into them at a young age it can help both the groups to know the differences and mannerisms of each other and respect those differences.

The major problem shall actually be bigger than having a lack of understanding and low confidence, the low knowledge of the opposite sex may result in bad cooperation in future relationships and may  lead to constant arguments, it may also cause a sense of discomfort to a woman when criticised by  men due to her lack of exposure to this particular feedback. Finally, the whole idea of a singular-sex school does fit   certain age criteria but can cause more problems in the future than resolving them.

In Conclusion, many schools should practice this method up till a certain age and then incorporate another group of sex during the higher education phase, this way children can actually be isolated in the right way and also be prepared when their age is correct, if not so this type of schooling system can sometimes not only take out the most joyful moments from a students life but also leave them socially impaired.","## Task Achievement:

"Experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","In the future, specialists predict that most of the work done by humans will be replaced with robots. Having machines replace humans has both positive and negative aspects, we will discuss these in detail.

The main advantage of using robots to perform a task is its performance and accuracy. A robot can outdo a human in terms of perfection and quality. For example, the aviation industry has zero-tolerance for errors, and so they prefer automation to manual labour. Another important advantage of employing a robot is increased productivity. A robot never takes a vacation nor it requires a break, they can perform their duty round the clock. To illustrate, manufacturing industries can utilize an industrial robot to perform repetitive tasks. 

Although there are positive sides to using robots to perform jobs, there are equally negative sides present for the same. One of the main disadvantages of using robots is their high maintenance cost. For instance, machines tend to wear and tear, run into technical glitches it is often required to maintain and upgrade. Another negative aspect of replacing humans with robots is joblessness. In this age, when the population is growing at a rapid phase the need for a job opportunity is scarce. Adding to the existing job crisis, introducing robots will escalate the joblessness to a new height.

In conclusion, while there are positives of using robots to perform work, there is some significant negative impact. Proper care should be taken to strike a balance on how much work can be replaced with  robots.","## Task Achievement:

Then, for most of the past century houses were filled with people, consequently making them concerned about their condition. Some of the houses have not been maintained for years, so  people may experience some domestic issues, such as water pouring from a rooftop and more. Moreover, these old buildings might be placed in those streets that have not been noisy and crowdy until nowadays, and the people are likely to find out what are those architectural and planning issues that caused such problems and it all leads to buildings history where they can be found.

Secondly, it needs to be found out how and what certain individuals should  look at their house history. Maybe to most ,people the best of research would become the internet.

Some people think  that museum should be an enjoyable places to attract and entertain young people. Others think the purpose of museum is educating not entertaining. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Many people believe that musems are place where every person, especially youngsters, enjoy and can last their time by observing items, while others claim that this place is a centre of education rather than disneyland. This essay will discusses both arguments and then I will give my own perspective.

The main reason why a big number of people visit museums with their children is to expand outlook by demonstrating local history, famous ancestors and old customs. As well as this, young generation only want to enjoy instead of getting knowledge about something. For example, many researches conclude that current generation spend a great deal of time in the social media rather than reading books. In addition, by visiting such kind of places they can be more aware about their country and citizens. If museums are constructed as an antractive place it would catch more attention by adolecents. Furthermore, museums are more likely to be fun and useful for building close relationships between parent and kid. 

On the other hand, there are several strong arguments who sees museums as an educational place. As far as museums are concerned tradisionalists argue with former opinion. The key reason for this lacking of understanding what museum is by teenagers. Moreover, teenagers seek only enjoyment rather than gaining something that they do not know. Also, items which are exhibited in museums are very historical. Thus people ought to visit for educational purposes.

In conclusion,there are merits and drawbacks of two arguments, hence both notions can taken into consideration. However, on balance, I lean to the idea that supervisors of museums try to use advantages of both approaches.","## Task Achievement:

"In some citites and towns all over the world ,the high volume of traffic is a problem.what are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem.","Traffic congestion is an issue in  urban centres.In some parts of urban places around the globe,an increase in traffic cramps is an issue.The causes are people using their own cars and  not working from home.However,solutions like  taking public transportation and telecommuting are actions to curtain the phenomenon.The essay will explain in detail the  causes as well as solutions to tackle the problems in the subsequent paragraphs with examples.

To begin with ,there are several factors for the rise of  traffic jams in the cities.Firstly,the majority of people in the cities prefer to use their own private cars to go to work and most students too travel around the same time.This causes congestion during  peak hours.Although workers will  feel comfortable with their vehicles ,others will suffer.Moreover,most employees are not working from home which leads to an increase in traffic because a lot of them are travelling to work within the same period.If workers work from home,there will be no  jams.For instance,during the covid 19 period ,companies made their staffs   work from home which helped ensure the easy flow of vehicles on the road.Therefore, an increase in private car usage and personnel not working from home are the two factors of  increased cramps in the cities.

Secondly,there are several solutions to tackle the problem of congestion.Individuals should take public transportation so that the number of cars on the road will reduce.It will ensure free flow  on the road.It will help employees and students to reach their destinations on time.For example,in Adiembra , most students and workers take public transport and this has led to ease flow on the highway.Furthermore,telecommuting is when  personnel works from their various houses.The initiative will help tackle the jams problems because employees will be working from home.

"Many university degree holders cannot find a job in their chosen profession.What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it ?","Unfortunately many university students have to choose a different career path.The reasons for the same are mainly due to imbalances in the job sector.In my view, proper planning by the government can bring the situation under control.

Crucial factors contributing for not finding a job in chosen profession are lack of availability and pay disparity. In many countries, jobs available and university offering courses are not aligned properly. For instance, an excerpt from the Stanford mentioned that half of the graduates from United Kingdom have pursued business and one in every three graduates from India is an engineer. This is forcing them to shift to a new industry for a living. Also, salary differences in some of the industries is also leading to change their profession. For example, scientists in many developing countries are paid often very less where they do not have any option but to quit and continue in a different domain.

This inequality can be mitigated by careful planning at individual and government level. Governments should understand how the market is shaping up, focus on increasing the corresponding skill set. Also, ensuring there is a correlation between the no of graduates and the employees for a particular industry. For example, Vietnam focused on improving industrial skills as they knew many industries will be set up because of its economic policies. This helped immensely for the students and resulted in double digit economic growth. Although planning from the congress is required, one must understand the trends at individual level for a better future.

To conclude, many graduates are ending up in a different profession than they wished for, because of the inequalities between the courses offered and industry prevalent. Countries should predict the market trends and focus on providing the necessary skill set for its graduates.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In recent times, several people have had conflicts about whether employers have to obey the dress principles in office or whether the productivity of work is their priority. I strongly believe that people should concentrate on the quality of their work completely instead of their dress, and this essay serves to elaborate on my opinion.

A majority of people argue that employers prioritize the quality of their work. When people pay all their attention to working, their production and performance in a company will be better and bring several benefits for both themselves and this company instead of spending time on resolving the problem related to fashion. Specifically, their company receives more reputation, hence employment's career and position may have a chance to be promoted. For instance,in a prestigious company like Apple, there are no requirements about the employees' dress, Apple's employees spend most time on design, fixing errors, and enhancing their products. These criteria made Apple become a famous and successful brand and community with several electronic devices existing everywhere.

Moreover, the dress restrictions may expand the gap between employment in their working environment. Several companies force their workers to wear impolite clothes with many costume accessories, some staff want to show their wealth to others by their fashion style and only interact with people who have brand clothes like them and avoid working with people wearing simple clothes. Hence, after a long time, these kinds of working environments may become a fashion competition, instead, people have to create ideas, and products to promote and increase the company's profit. Many companies have collapsed for a similar reason that the directors create complicated and unnecessary principles that lead to low-quality working environment, so many employees quit their jobs and these companies lose their customers.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that bosses should not impose dress rules on their staff based on the effect on the productivity and workplace.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so then it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that many individuals believe that reading the news in the press and watching it on television wastes too much time as it does not relate to any aspects of their lives. Personally, I partly agree with this view due to some reasons.

On the one hand, It is considered to be a waste of time  to catch the news through the newspaper or social media as the appearance of numerous fake news every day. This happens because there are some content creators nowadays who make themselves well-known by posting untrue stories online. This leads to the problem that people involved in the stories somehow are not only misunderstood but also misjudged by the readers. For example, a few famous artists in Viet Nam were said to pass away after a long time suffering from cancer, while they are actually fine. 

On the other hand, reading or watching the news is suggested as the best way to keep up with the latest information about things happening around the world. People living far away need the news to catch up with what is occurring in their hometown or country. Besides, news can help us to improve our general knowledge as well. For instance, about 3 years ago when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, everyone had to be isolated from each other and therefore, getting news on some online basis or on TV was the most efficient way to get information about what we had to do to prevent the disease.

"Some think that governments should support retired people financially while others believe they should take care of themselves.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is irrefutable that senior citizens are the most vulnerable members of our society and are often financially supported in enormous developed economies. In numerous nations around the world, elderly people accrue funds for themselves that give them a sense of independence and curtail the financial burden on a province.

In this contemporary era, people prefer to become financially independent by accumulating funds for their golden years. It gives them a sense of independence and self-respect. The government of Canada encourages pupils for financial planning  so that their citizens can lead a stress-free and luxurious old age.

Moreover, this approach is beneficial to curtail the financial budget of a country. Instead of distributing money among senior citizens, the government can invest these funds for development such as infrastructure refurbishment. This would captivate the influx of tourists, hence, a country's economy will boost. A multitude of dollars were invested by the government of Indonesia to restore their historical buildings which attract thousands of visitors every year. As a result, their revenue increased precipitously. 

Financial support to older generations is their fundamental right and the onus of the legitimate agencies. This is because retired people have paid huge tariffs during their working years and contribute toward a country's development to a great extent. Therefore, it is the obligation of the financial ministry to pay them back for their hard-earned money.

Even though elderly people have paid a significant amount of taxes to the government, I firmly believe that becoming financially independent not only gives a sense of freedom and self-respect but also reduces the financial burden on a nation. Thus, they should take care of their monetary needs by themselves and not rely on legal affirms.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is true that popular people are more known for their glamorous lifestyle than what they actually have gained and therefore they might be bad role models for the youth society. However, I partly agree with this statement.

On the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why it is thought that wealthy famous people may badly affect young and ambitious ones. The lives of rich, famous people are presented through social media and teenagers are exposed to the luxurious life of their dreams without accurately understanding their background. For example, they might not figure out how much effort famous people have made into meeting their current life and this appears as something easy to them. Furthermore, following rich people's life may lead to high unrealistic expectations for juveniles and by not reaching such a place, they might feel disappointed.

On the other hand, not all people are famous without their achievements being considered and if so it would not necessarily have negative effects. Firstly, watching a person lead his or her life by achieving their passion, teaches ineexperienced ones that they can possibly make their dreams come true. A young boy for instance, may become interested in playing a guitar under the influence of his famous guitarist. Secondly, by setting wealthy famous people as role models, young ones are becoming tempted to work hard with the ambition of a more luxurious life.

In conclusion, Although following people who are only well-known for their charming life might be a bad example for adolescents, I think it would bring profits for them as well.","## Task Achievement:

"It is generally observed that almost all high level jobs are done by men.Does it mean that the government should encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be observed for women?

In my opinion, I disaggree that a percentage of jobs tobe observed for women, and the reasonsfor my deductionis given below.

The main reason is that, it is step towardsdiscrimination men. In certain countries, such as Sri Lanka, particular Governments post, eg. Secretary of female Affairs is set a side ofr a woman, and men are discourage from applying to the post, this is gender discrimination. Such seggregation should not be allowed as it is unfair to men.

Additionaly, some job can only be performed by men. It is proven by both medical studies and sphycological studies, jobs such as Head of Armed forces can only be sucessfully performed by men only. Therefore, having resstrictions to such positions may become an invalid action.

Furthermore, the best person to the job must be appointed, and it should not be a matter of the gender. For an instance, Heinze Company 'a the current Chief Executive  Officer is a female, a position that was formally held by a man. As such it allows the the company to benefit from the bast leadership. Therefore, gender should not be deciding factor in occupying a senior post.

"In recent years tourists have paid attention to preserving both the culture and environment of the places they visit. However, some people think that it is impossible to be a responsible tourist. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","It is argued that there is no chance for tourists to take responsibility for protecting the environment and culture of host countries. However, I disagree with this view and believe that is a worthy aim  that can be achieved in various ways. 

Firstly, everyone should be informed about cultural heritage and its great impact on the environment. They should be more aware of their and childrens' behaviour. For instance, the  young generation must be properly educated in order to avoid littering public places with a variety of rubbish such as plastic bottles or residue of food, or touching valuable items like statues, special documents, famous pictures and others. 

Moreover, there should not be promoted cultural differences between both local and international humanity. A bright example of this  can be India, where cows are established as sacred animals. Nevertheless, some individuals may bring beef or eat it, breaking Indians' religion. Additionally, there is a rule that people are not allowed to chew gum. Unfortunately, as a result of bad awareness and poor preparation for visiting foreign countries, similar situations occur and the nations change their minds about these individuals. Also, the community of Tangier in Morocco have done a lot of efforts such as recruiting about 70 security agents in all museums of the city and plentiful signs hanging at the main door for giving more details about the story of each building.

"Some people say that to prevent illness and disease, governments should focus more on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems.","It is believed that illness and disease are resulted from external factors related to the environment and housing. The government should make more efforts to mitigate environmental pollution and housing problems. From my perspective, I totally agree that this is a potential way to prevent illness and disease.

 

First of all, the significant reason that explains why reducing environmental pollution is worth protecting people’s health is the speed of spreading viruses. Although viruses are tiny creatures, depending on the variety of substances in the environment, especially the polluted environment, the number of viruses in the atmosphere increases significantly and develop many different variables. Consequently, people are easily attacked by them during the process of absorbing oxygen for survival because they will integrate in the flow of air to pervade the human body. Therefore, if the environmental pollution is reduced, the probability of patients getting disease by virus may go down.

 

Furthermore, housing is also a conscious problem when discussing reducing health problems of people. At present, there are many people who are homeless or poor and living in slum areas leading to low access to medical conditions when getting sick. Moreover, due to the effects of external factors such as lacking foods, not hygienic environment, etc., they usually get diseases related to respiratory, gastrointestinal or skin infections. Hence, this may motivate the government to provide social housing to the homeless or raise funding to help people in slums to afford houses. This step is helpful to mitigate illness and disease in society.

 

In conclusion, I would restate that environmental pollution and housing issues in many regions are the major causes of illness and disease, so the government should pay more attention to reduce these causes.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","There is no doubt that earning while studying has many advantages. There are some people support acquiring a job as long with education, others oppose this due to some reasons. In my opinion, I strongly believe in former view because it has some merits.

On the one side of the argument, it is sometimes thought students would focus only their academics instead of  getting a part- time work. This is because engaging in the other activities might result in poor performance in the examinations. Consequently, these learners would suffer a lot as they could not show an excellent educational background in their adulthood and employability would slim. For instance, in India, rarely, children have been allowed to work by both their parents as well as the teachers.

On the other hand, nevertheless, opponents of the above mentioned argument point that joining as a trainee in some work would give a better job prospects when they become adult. In other word, having an hand on experience in the field of preferrence, could give a chance to successful. For example, nursing students often work as a care giver during their student period. This not only assist to earn money, but also job related skills. Therefore, I, firmly think that joining a small work along with studies is highly essential for the futuristic employees.

"Men and women are different in terms of their characteristics and abilities. For this reason, 
some jobs are better done by men and others by women.
Do you agree or disagree?","Even in this modern stage of mankind's history, there are some people who believe job positions should be divided by gender and men or women have  limited, specified abilities that are not in the other sex. I contend that this cliche needs to be stopped once forever.

Firstly, the various experiences in history showed us that there are so many men ad women that can go through society's dictated rules and become even better than the dominated gender in that occupation. One of the most common instances is how men became great and excellent chefs while the society stereotypes claimed cooking is a female job and men should not take it as an occupation. Moreover, there are great names of women in male-dominated jobs like being a judge, astronaut, etc.

Secondly,limiting people by demonstrating typical rules for them controls the unseen abilities and stops them from exposing. As if Maryam Mirzakhani one of the greatest mathematicians in her times, had accepted society's mindset about women, she would never make that phenomenon in the science of mathematics. So in order to not lose the chance  of having these phenomenons, there should be an equal and unisex perspective on occupations and abilities.

By way of conclusion, I again insist on the miracle of the human's body that is never predictable and should not be generalised. There should be equal chances for both sexes from childhood to find their capabilities and wishes and not be judged for what they decided to do or be in their future life.","**Task Achievement:**

Many students find it harder to study when they are at university or college than when they were at school. Why is this? What can be done to solve the problem?,"It is true that many students tend to meet several challenges due to the differences between studying at school and at college or university. To explain this tendency, I think that the reasons behind this phenomenon are the distinction of subjects and how to learn in these educational environments. My essay also mentions potential solutions relating to the convenience of technologies to solve this.

To begin with, there are many factors contributing to the increased difficulty that students experience in higher education, compared to their time in school. Firstly, the main reason relates to the subjects they have to learn. If there is a plethora of fundamental knowledge that school’s syllabus teaches students can be seen in a variety of aspects such as math, geography or science, it is different for students to level up to university or college. Many classes in the tertiary levels tend to focus on one aspect depending on the majors students follow. To be more understandable, a university student’s specialization is economics and finance, for example, find more difficulties in their academic credits such as microeconomics, even though it is a high-level version of math which she or he had learnt since high school Moreover, acquiring knowledge in university or college is considered as tougher, because of the root of the distinctive learning methods. In Vietnam, for instance, teachers usually prepare diments for each lesson and it is compulsory for students to learn these by heart leading to the insurance of passing the tests. However, the opposite was true in university, professors often teach basic sections in class, thus it is obligatory for students to do more research by compiling materials and preparing lesson plans for their own to fully understand.

There are many solutions that could be implemented to address these challenges. In the contemporary era, it is reckoned that the significant development of technological devices could improve students’ path of intelligence. Firstly, having too many paper materials leads to  difficulty in finding out what students need for each subject. People could take photos of these and upload them to a computer which could rearrange them into separate folders named to each class. As a result, students could open tons of documents with a click without messing around. Secondly, there are websites that enhance doing tasks. For example, Chat GBT, an AI chatbot would be a magic tool giving a variety of ideas whether university students are in a situation of running out of ideas for assignments or even answering tricky math questions.

In conclusion, the transition from school to university or college should pose many pressures due to the difficulty of academic subjects and imparting knowledge. However,  applying several digital technologies would strengthen learning well.","## Task Achievement:

"some people say that to prevent illnesses and diseases, governments should focus more on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","No doubt, people’s health is influenced by the environment and housing conditions. That is why some people opine that governments should focus more on the environment and housing to prevent various ailments. While I do admit that these areas require attention, in my opinion, by simply addressing environmental pollution and housing scarcity, we cannot see much of an improvement in public health.

Indeed, environmental pollution and dirty surroundings cause many health problems. For example, air pollution is a major issue in cities and, consequently many urban residents suffer from respiratory ailments. Lack of access to clean water is another problem that millions of people face in poor countries. Unhygienic surroundings are the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and fleas which spread many diseases. Therefore, if the government looks into environmental pollution and provides basic housing amenities, such problems can be avoided to a great extent.

Nevertheless, simply focusing on the environment and housing will not prevent all diseases. The government has to do much more. It has to allocate a portion of its budget to prevent diseases through vaccinations. It should also spend on screening tests through which serious diseases such as cancer can be detected long before actual symptoms occur. In earlier ,stages most cancers are totally curable through inexpensive treatments. Launching health awareness campaigns is another thing governments can do to improve public health. Even if the government provides housing to all, diseases can still spread if people are ignorant and allow stagnant water to collect in their surroundings.

In conclusion, although giving priority to environmental issues and housing will improve public health, a lot more has to be done to eradicate diseases. The government, for example, has to launch health awareness campaigns, provide free vaccinations and regular health checkups to ensure that people live a healthy and long life.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To What extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people are of the opinion that the stars in current time are popular for their assets and fairness than their work and achievements. I completely disagree, and firmly believe that modern stars are striving hard to improve in all aspects to be a complete person. Firstly, this essay will state about their philanthropic activities then, move on to discuss about significant modern day achievements and how these two factors influence for the good of young people.

To begin with, people with fame be it movie stars, sportsers, politicians etc. in the contemporary world have shown a lot of responsibility and care towards the welfare of their public.

 Their scrupoulusness and dedication to be available to destitute and under-previliged at all times by establishing charitable organizations and other events is a great gesture. Moreover, these are the right ways to inspire young generation so that even they participate in such welfare events. Thus, generalising based on few cases where celebrities have set bad examples is not an approprite way. For instance, during the pandemic where lot of public have suffered without basic medical amenities quiet a few movie stars have donated hefty amounts. In addition to that they also campaigned to raise funds for a good cause to which they received a huge response there by proving that they are not only socially responsible but also take the youth along with them in their great journey.

Furthermore, even if we consider celebrities in their domain, their contribution to that field is invaluable. They have inspired many young talents and even encouraged them to explore their domain of interest. Thus, it shows they do care of the youth. For example, sports stars like Ronaldo, Messi, Fedrer, Sachin have all set a high benchmark for the youngsters to have a crack at it. Their not only known for their talent but also for being an all-rounder. Be it in helping poor or even in their field they have done it all to be perfect role model to any youngster. 

To conclude, generalising all the celebrities and classifying them as a bad symbol to the youth is a pretty hasty conclusion. Thus, people should have a holistic view and not rely on few cases to decide if its good or bad influence. If we comprehend the above cases where majority of celebrities have contributed the greater good of youth by their talents and social activities, it can be firmly asserted that the celebrities now set a good example.","## Task Achievement:

From my point of view, violence in any way has bad effects on person’s mindset and society.

Depends on past events, violent contents has been added to films as the best way to help the viewers understand more and have better vision about realities around the world.

Virtual and reality can be mixed, gamers and viewers will be led to accept these violence and consider it as the truth and legal in the real world. It not only affects the subconscious but also involves unconscious mindset where people can’t control themselves.

Machines Are Taking Over More And More Jobs Previously Done By Humans. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages and give your own opinion.,"In today’s world, there is a growing tendency to use artificial intelligence instead of people in a number of spheres. This essay will first discuss the merits and demerits of this trend and then I will give my own perspective on the issue.

On the one hand, replacing humans with mechanical persons in some industries has several boons. First of all, androids cannot make any mistakes. A slew of factories uses bionic persons in production to avoid human error and to raise the quality of their products. For example, Toyota introduced engine assembly robots in all factories 50 years ago and, as a result, its engines are now considered to be the most reliable ones in the world. Secondly, machines are able to function without breaks and produce more goods for customers than workers do. Usually, when the demand for goods steps up and manufacturers cannot meet it, they have two options – to hire more workers or use robots. The latter is preferable because robots do not need breaks.

On the other hand, employing robots instead of humans also has downsides. The main drawback is that there is a large proportion of employees who are most likely to lose their jobs in a wide range of spheres. Unfortunately, many professions are no longer in demand today and it is extremely difficult for specialists in these areas to find a job. For instance, applicants cannot find well-paid jobs in automotive assembly plants because almost all jobs involve robots. Another negative aspect is that robots do not have creativity. It is impossible to improve a product without humans and mechanical persons can do just what is written in the program. Thus, in this case, companies cannot work without people.

In conclusion, although there are many benefits to using robots instead of humans such as the absence of people’s errors and machines' ability to operate without breaks, it also has a number of shortcomings. Therefore, I contend that replacing humans with modern robots is advantageous because such innovations might bring new product quality standards that will definitely be useful for ultimate customers.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people argue that museums ought to be a place for recreational purposes, while others argue that museums ought to be used solely for educating people. Museums can be used to attract tourists which will benefit the country in the end as it can flourish the economy. In contrast, museums are imperative to educate the public about their art, history and culture. In my opinion, museums should be used for both educational and entertainment purposes.

To begin with, museums attract numerous tourists from all around the globe. From an economic perspective, museums generate job opportunities in the market and contribute to the growth of the local economy because of tourists, which will benefit the nation in the end. A museum where people could enjoy and entertain attracts more people than other museums. There are museums where it is not only about history or art, such as the kimchi museum in South Korea and the chocolate museum in Belgium. Hence, since these museums are quite popular among international tourists, museums should be a place to entertain people. 

On the contrary, museums play a crucial role in educating the public about art, history, science, culture among others. Moreover, it is imperative for educating future generations about their history, culture and roots. Thus, museums are undoubtedly a huge source of knowledge, so it ought to be solely used for educational purposes.

More people decided to have children at a later age than in the past. Why? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In today's society, choosing to have children later in life is becoming more and more common. Despite the fact that a number of reasons contribute to this tendency, the disadvantages of having children later in life likely outweigh the advantages.

One of the reasons for this phenomena is that women may now choose to put off having children by taking medicines or using certain types of contraception thanks to medical development. Additionally, many adults these days tend to invest more time in order to put heavy emphasis on growing their occupations than on having children. Therefore, it is undeniable that both men and women lose time when they have an individualized concentration on their careers. These explanations demonstrate that choosing to have children later in life depends on both personal decision and environmental factors.

One of the main benefits is that kids can develop in financially stable homes, which improves their quality of life by enabling parents to provide them more resources and opportunities. However, older parents could have many difficulties in giving birth and keeping up with their kids.  For parents whose age gap with their children is significant, their enthusiasm and sympathy might not be the same as younger parents’. This means that a child might expect less physical and emotional support than if they were born to youthful parents. 

In conclusion, it is generally more disadvantageous to give birth at a later age, in spite of the reasons and advantages to support this choice by parents. The ideal time to have a family depends on each person's situation and preferences, but it shouldn't be left too late.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that in the morden world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is true that in today’s society people tend to depend on each other. While some people advocate this view, I believe that individuals have become more independent.
On the one hand, there are those who believe that people are likely to rely on others nowadays. Firstly, young people who have just emberked on their career struggle to many things in life. Because they are novices in their company, they are paid meager salary. As a result, they do not enough finances to purchase big assets, which are exorbitant, such as a house and a car, and they need their parrents’ help to solve the problem. Secondly, people have a tendency to count on co-workers at work. Today, work is highly specialised, so it requires people to attain professional skills and knowledge to do well their work. However, It is hard for one person to work alone. They need to collaborate with another to come up with a plan or their work.
On the other hand, I side with those who argue that individuals become increasingly independence. In the morden world, the proliferation of the internet allows people to access information easily, so they could search any things without help. There are a wide range of online courses in diverse fields, such as learning English, cooking, information technology. Therefore, students no longer necessary to attend a in-person class to get knowledge. Take my brother as an example. He is inundated with work so he do not have time participating a English class without flexible time, but by learning online course he might actively get knowledge whenever and wherever he wants.

Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reason for this? What can be done to solve the problem.,"Undoubtedly, education is crucial for the overall development of humanity. However, the academy provides an atmosphere for learners in the simplest way but the new generation is unable to concentrate at school. This essay will  reticulate some of its problems and propose some possible solutions to alleviate this.

Firstly, the modern Era is of educated people; so education is considered the chief concern among parents as well as the government. The scarcity of education leads to unemployment and reduces the growth of the nation to a huge proportion. Youngsters, who are the future of any country, need to be educated for betterment. They are not able to focus on their studies at institutions because of the old teaching methods. for example, in India majority of states are in a developing situation and lack  advanced facilities in all aspects; one of them is the old teaching method of reading books again and again with only theoretical way. old fashion brings Monotony to recruitment.

furthermore, mostly in all schools in India still use an old method of teaching ""beat and teach"". Lack of confidence among students feels anxiety to attend the institution. To tackle this issue and create enthusiasm in toddlers, modernisation in teaching is necessary and it will arouse the productivity of students and teachers as well. Not only the corporate sector but also the regime should provide an exotic experience with up-to-date technology.

To conclude, modern learning and teaching methods are alluring and appealing which creates zeal between learners and teachers and help to reduce the dilemma to focus on studies.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of school subjects. Others people think that it is a waste of valuable school time.,"The importance of global media seems to increase every year, so much so to the point of introducing news channel into the classrooms. I believe this to be dangerous and potentially damaging due to the nature of the media.

Firstly, considering the importance of education in modern society, it is extremely worrisome and dangerous to consider substituting school subjects with international news. This is because there is no correct, balanced, unbiased news source. For example,if a child spent their school days watching FOX NEWS, they would potentially have a skewed opinion of the world due to its unabashed right-wing credentials. Therefore, changing a child’s information diet from a traditional subject such as music or geography to watching a potentially partisan news channel is an extremely risky idea.

Secondly, if international news were to become a new subject it could have a detrimental emotional impact on young minds. In general, the majority of news is negative, hence the expression ‘if it bleeds it leads’. For example, studies by the EFE News Agency show that 85% of headlines are negative in nature, usually referring to natural disasters, war, famine, etc. The logic of having these types of stories beamed into a school, to those of an impressionable age have to be challenged.

To conclude, due to the risk of political influences, and the harsh reality of global news, I am strongly in favour of maintaining the current curriculum.","## Task Achievement:

"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education, so that they can at least read, write and use number.

To what extent do you agree or disagree","Providing free schooling up to six years will enable people how to read, write as well as use number and eventually it will be the foremost procedure to remove poverty from developing nations. I am strongly agree with that statement as this system will develop individuals ethical behaviour to their resources and will help one to establish a new business. Now, I will articulate my point of view in the forthcoming paragraphs.

From an overall perspective, there are several merits of free education. Perhaps the predominant benefit is ethical behaviour to their resources. As those persons who have some basic educational knowledge, they do not make any misuse of their country's wealth. As a result, one region's wealth can be utilized properly. For example, a recent study found that 20% of natural gas is used more by illiterate people as they do not know how to use it properly. That's why I believe that education is required for a certain period of time.

A further point in favour of this free schooling is that it helps people to generate idea of starting modern business. If individuals have some basic knowledge of reading, writing and use numerical data, they can use their thinking ability to process up to date shop. By establishing a modern business, they can not only reduce the unemployment rate but also provide economical benefit for a community. For instance, according to a survey, those human beings who stopped their education at the age of 12 or 13, ended up a successful businessman or a politician and they are helping their nation to a great extent.

In conclusion, free of cost education system not only help one to gather ethical attitudes to the resources of his/her region but also help to stage a new business. And these activities helps a nation to achieve further benefit.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
What is your opinion?","In the era of technology, discussions about whether technology will threaten certain types of occupations. Some claim that most jobs will be invaded by these machines in the near future. In my opinion, robots will play a significant role in the future, but they will not take over the whole job market.

To begin with, each and every machine or robot has been designed and developed by human minds. It is true that these artificial creatures can do a lot of things, but they require someone to program with correct instruction in order for them to operate. No machine can take their own decision because they are not capable of thinking. Therefore, there will always be vacancies for jobs that need intelligence. Moreover, these devices should be designed by someone, always those tasks are done by human beings. For instance, a robot can instruct to repair a car, yet only humans can design a car that is comfortable for users to drive as that needs a higher level of intelligence. Another common fact is that robots cannot process empathy. As a result, they would not be used as judges and doctors who need social skills.

Nonetheless, certain categories of jobs will be taken over by these artificially intelligent machines. Most labour works that only need to repeat some procedures . Hence, those types of work will be replaced by robots in the future. Consequently, people should move away from works that only need physical strength and learn that work requires mental skills. 

To sum up, although jobs that contain repeated procedures are taken over by robots. However, these electronic and mechanical devices will not be able to take over the occupations that need empathy and personal views.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that increasing business and cultural contacts worldwide have 

positive influences on development; others think that they have negative effects on national identities. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about the effects which globalisation exerts. Some believe that globalisation surely benefits most countries in different fields such as the economy, education and politics; others , however, insist that it is diluting national identities. In my view, globalisation not only boosts economic development, but generally has positive effects on national identities.

Business contacts around the world contribute a lot to development. Investments from multinational companies create many job opportunities for local residents, and as a result, improve their living standards. That is the reason why many developing countries enact policies to encourage international businesses and foreign investments.

Moreover, with globalised communication, national cultures and integrity are more easily expressed to the outside world and receive  respect and appreciation. For example, the animated film ""Kungfu Panda"", has become a blockbuster hit in many countries recently. Since Kungfu and Panda are uniquely two Chinese elements, Chinese identity has been enhanced and  has impressed many people around the world through this film.

Those who harbour the view that cultural contacts may threaten national identities may argue that now the younger generations living in Shanghai eat hamburgers, drink coffee, work in skyscrapers and even speak English often, adapting a lifestyle similar to that of their Western counterparts. But, I think this is just a universal modern lifestyle and to protect our national identity does not mean that every Chinese should drink tea every day or use chopsticks every meal. In fact, the essence in our value system such as a moderation mindset still remains unchanged.

In summary, increasing business and cultural contacts does play an important role in a country's development. Meanwhile, a more prosperous economy facilitates the recognition and preservation of national culture and identity worldwide.","## Task Achievement:

Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development,"There is a tremendously controversial perspective heating debate over the significantly ever-increasing advertisement day in day out. Although this problem may have both pros and cons, I believe its advantages may outweigh its disadvantages.

Without a shadow of a doubt, there are several benefits of advertising for the time being. Advertisement can create great opportunities for businesses to sell more products with high quality because more people know about that product on social media. The TH true milk company, which can be cited for certain examples, has sold a great many products and their revenue increased significantly after advertising their products on online social networks such as Facebook, youtube, and google. Compared to other products which are not introduced in social media, the counterpart will bring numerous significant profits for the company. Therefore, advertising plays a very important role for businesses.

While the redeeming features of advertisement are widely acknowledged, its counterpart still lingers. Nowadays, some people are not keen on marketing activities because too many ads are annoying for people using social networks or watching TV. For instance, when they are watching some films on TV, advertising videos appear suddenly and it takes them much time to watch something that they do not have a demand for and they can feel unhappy and uncomfortable. Therefore, it brings a great volume of complications and negative influences on people’s lives.

Many people use social media to keep in touch with other people and for news events. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, using social applications in order to communicate with others or update report events becomes widespread among people. While there are some drawbacks associated with using social media, I believe the main benefits are more substantial. This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the drawbacks.

On the one hand, a primary advantage of using social media is that connections are made effortlessly regardless of the location or time. Hence, it helps many individuals who were immigrated to another country to make a connection with their relatives just by pressing a click. For example, it is so convenient for parents whose children study abroad to make a video call daily. In addition, due to the technological advancements in applications, various information is speared quickly, therefore, anyone can access the latest news. For instance, football fans are able to know the latest live football results on their way home.

On the other hand, a potential disadvantage of the existence of social media may be that each person would waste a lot of time on these social websites while it could be handled by time management. Also, people are maybe influenced by fake news published on such websites which provides some unreal content. For instance, teenagers are in danger of believing the fake lifestyle is presented by bloggers on Instagram. However, there is actually no evidence to support this view.

In conclusion, using social media would indeed seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, it is positive effects in terms of expanding their relationship and getting the up-to-date data is override the downsides.","### Task Achievement:

Some people think that robots are important for human future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is ubiquitously seen these days that the use of robots has been intensified more than ever, given various emerging dynamics. For human future growth, some individuals believe that the use of robots is important. Contrastingly, others believe that robots have a negative impact on the society. However, I find myself standing tall with the latter viewpoint. In the section underneath, this piece of writing shall propagate both the merits and demerits of the use of robots in human lives and society.

Some people believe the use of robots has many downsides for human growth. 

First and foremost, with the increasing use of AI, almost in every field, the work which used to be performed by humans has been overtaken by robots and resulted in a loss of jobs and unemployment. Secondly, a lot of individuals are using it to perform fraud. Nevertheless, over-reliance on robots could suffocate human creativity and critical thinking, as people may become too dependent on AI to solve problems. Recently, a renowned newspaper published a news, with the use of an AI-drive robot, a person was able to hack bank account details to steal money. 

There are advantages to the use of robots. With the use of AI, productivity, and efficiency have increased and human error has exponentially decreased. Furthermore, AI-powered robots can analyze vast amounts of data and make complex decisions For example, the Tesla self-driving car uses vehicle sensors to mimic the human brain resulting in a decrease in accidents and is programmed to ensure human safety. Additionally, in the healthcare sector, robots can perform surgeries with reduced human error.

Employers should give their staff at least a 4-week holiday a year to make employees better at their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the growing fierce competition and the rapid pace of daily life, people in today's society are suffering from heavy physical and psychological pressure without sufficient res. Many people frequently change jobs due to the imbalance between life and job. There is a heated debate about whether staff should be received at least one month holiday to work efficiently. To a certain extent I agree that having rest is more beneficial, but, we cannot ignore the impacts of prolonging rest time. This essay will discuss both viewpoints.

On the one hand, admittedly, companies can have many benefits from prolonging holidays. To begin with, long-time holidays will provide employees with more time for other necessary things, namely enjoying rest, accompanying family members and developing interest. For example, several entrepreneurs offer their staffs some leisure time to stay more with their families. As a consequence, they will adjust themselves to work after rest and improve their work efficiency.

On the other hand, the policy of extending employees' holidays also lead to some drawbacks. Allowing employees to have long vacations can be a great burden for companies in the long term. With few staffs, the company have to delay the deadline of certain projects, resulting in lower efficiency and productivity, for instance. Therefore, it is hardly any firms can carry out a policy of more than 15 days off with salary. Additionally, an extended holiday time will make people less enthusiastic about work and have a feeling of bored when going back to their workplaces.

In conclusion, more emphasis should be placed on providing a vacation  to enhance staff morale. However, The right choice for entrepreneurs is to offer a suitable holiday time period of one or two weeks for manpower.","## Task Achievement:

some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time .This can benefit teenageers and the community as well .to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"A group of public argue that young children should serve a community free of cost in their leisure time, which helps to carry out fruitful results for both of them. I strongly support that view of people because doing social tasks will not only help teenagers and chance to explore skills but also provides helping hands to people.

Being engaed in social working, give mentally and physically satisfation to juveniles. In their busy lifestyle, they don’t have time for extra curriculum activities, get more depressed. But working on community task give a chance to them to divert their energy in a good way which helps to reduce their depression. For example :- a study carried out by a university in the United States in which get results that adolescents who serve for community for 10 hours are less likely to feel depressed as compared to those who do not work  volunteer.

Likewise, doing volunteer work with youngsters give aid to society for a better living environment. Many organizations effort for the improvements of structure and environmental conditions of the society which leads a people to obtain the superior quality of living style. like:-In India a campaign was started by the Indian Prime Minister with unpaid workers in which they sweep roads and planted herbaceous trees on the sides of roads to overcome air pollution which ultimately benefits local crowd.

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people are of the opinion that the best method for a child to learn about cooperation is by playing team sports at school. Therefore, I completely hold the same view. 

Team sports play a vital role in a child’s learning. It helps children to become diverse as it opens the possibility to discover new talents. Say ,for example, a timid and shy child can learn that he or she may possess the ability of a leader and soon can be utilised for better performance not only in school but as well as in life. In addition, they can also learn how to cope with challenges and face failures with their heads up, without any hard feelings. Through proper guidance, and positive and negative feedback, they can whole-heartedly accept whatever criticisms are thrown at them. Moreover, sportsmanship and fair team play can also be enhanced alongside  cooperation because they can come up and achieve a general goal. 

The personal comfort zone can be expanded as well, by encountering  other people and eventually creating a new set of friends. For instance, a friend who is one call or chat away during times of hardships. By that, they can never feel alone and left out. 

In summary, a child’s cooperative behaviour can be learned through participation in team sports as it can open the possibility for diversity to discover new talents, how to deal with failures and challenges, learn how to play fairly and the importance of sportsmanship. Best of all, they widen their circle of friends inside or outside their safe zone. Therefore, in conclusion, I extremely agree with this opinion.","## Task Achievement:

Discuss both views and give youre opinion.,"People have different opinions about playing computer games is bad for children, as opposed to it can be good in some ways. I agree with the latter, and I believe several aspects exist to further this topic. 

It is understandable why people think computer games are harmful to kids. First, it can cause some physical problems, for example, weak eyesight, unhealthy backbones, and leg problems. Second, computers are a new trend for most parents. It is hard for them to accept a new item, opposite to what they are used to playing with in the old time. Finally, indeed, PC plays need more supervision. The internet environment prevents parents from allowing their children to play. 

However, there are several reasons why I think we should not deny computer plays completely. On the one hand, nowadays the technology department is facing the most significant growth ever, our world will depend significantly on it. It is a critical skill for everyone's lives in the future, and offspring should start learning it in their childhood. Besides, these technological development are already happening in our daily life. On the other hand, everything has its drawbacks. We cannot protect kids from these things because of that. More, there are a lot of advantages to playing PC plays. They can face lots of different situations that hardly exist in real life and learn how to cope with them. Similarly, these games provide extra knowledge about this planet.

Some people say that most of the urgent problems can only be solved with international cooperation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Current years, we have realized that so many urgent problems can be solved by multi- national cooperation. Although it can’t be denied that it holds true to some issues, I think this is not the perfect resolution for all urgent troubles.
It’s obvious that cross-border cooperation has recently contributed to improve and reduce some global issues. For example, global warming calls for deeply concern from all nations and requests them to participate to reduce both tree cutting, gas emissions and plastic consumption.
However, governments of every country should be responsible for their own internal issues. Every country understands clearly about what are their urgent problems and how priority level they set aside as their country’s goal. Besides, each nation has own culture and administration system, common global processes sometimes are unable to apply. Each government will revise their multinational agreements in applying progress, subjected to their nation’s conditions. For example same- sex- marriage is opened and legalized in many countries, but it is still banned in others.

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Requirements for having an academic qualification for applicants are debatable. Some people argue that job applicant's social skills are more valuable than their degrees. This essay  will explain why having academic qualifications is far more beneficial than the other.

Academic qualification is one of the prerequisites when searching for a job. These people studied hard to land  their dream job. Education is necessary, due to the fact that this will mould the knowledge and understanding of a person, in the subject or profession that they are aiming for. Having the knowledge is critical in executing a satisfactory result at work. Social skills alone can't bring you anywhere. For instance, some of them are often called ""people pleasers ""at work. They only know how to talk but don't have the capability required to do a job well. That's why companies are hiring employees based on their Educational backgrounds, qualifications and skills.

On the other hand, having  good social skills is also critical for employees to build camaraderie in the workplace. Having a good relationship with your colleagues  makes for a better working environment. In contrast, when there is a barrier among co-workers the quality of work may be affected. However, let's not forget that some people are considered introverts but are good at their jobs.

To conclude, possessing a degree is critical for a smooth flow inside the company  while having  good social skills is also beneficial among the employees. I would say, that it go hand in hand but ,still I believe, that, having the qualification far more outweighs the other.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is a controversy about whether adolescents should get an occupation after secondary school or continuing their study at higher education institution to obtain success. I totally think that studying at tertiary is a better choice.
There is no denying that studying for higher degree is immensely beneficial to teenagers. First of all, should they study at university or college, they can get international-recognized certifications after graduation, which is necessary for some particular jobs. To exemplify, it is claimed that people can not accomplish jobs demanding expertise if they do not have academic degrees such as doctor, teacher and lawyer. What is more, with their in-depth and academic knowledge, they can enhance employment opportunities because employers often recruit those are professional, in addition, they can seize a suitable position as well as get promotion, which can help them to earn more income.
On the other hand, it is undoubted that working after high school is also a good choice for many youngsters. It is an alternative for those getting bored with studying so they can do some manual occupations. They can get more practical experience in actual circumstances, which is helpful as they can apply it and avoid mistakes to work more effectively. Besides, it is believed that adolescents can earn money very soon and become financially independent, which is a sign of maturity. They will learn how to manage their income and use it adequately. Therefore, they will not waste their money in buying unnecessary things. For instance, many teenagers in the Western often leave home to live without their parent’s support.

"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home.

Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","In recent times, it is paramount to recycle plastic bags, bottles etc. To reduce the wastage of natural and man-made resources and to improve its usefulness. Many people argue that children should learn this skill of recycling objects at school, while others insist that parents should teach this to their children.  I admit that parents can act as a guide or mentor, but I firmly believe that in academy students can get practical knowledge also. This essay will discuss both the views by demonstrating facts and points.

To begin with, it is very important to protect the environment from getting polluted. For this, schools can introduce a compulsory subject of waste management in the curriculum. Therefore, children will learn more about it as dedicated time slot will be allocated for exploring this issue. Moreover, children will get hands-on experience and practical knowledge too. It is evident that cognition and intellectual skills are developed more by performing group activities. Peers play a vital role in encouraging and inculcating interest in things which aloof individual finds hard to incur. So, school can act as a channel to motivate its students in reducing the misuse.

On the other hand, kids at home imitate what their parents do. For example, the way parents eat, communicate, etc. Similarly, parents should imbibe the habits of reducing and reusing left over items in themselves, which will be ultimately inherited to the next generation. It has been always stated that home is the first school of the kids. Therefore, parents should indulge their kids in such activities and help then in becoming responsible citizens of the nation. 

 To conclude, parents are the primary source of the knowledge of the kids and what parents can do nobody can do. But, by performing real-time activities with class fellows  can have a long lasting effect on the minds of growing kids.  Thus, they can contribute in a better way in waste management and make this world a better place to live.","## Task Achievement:

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"In this day and age, there are many factors that help people more straightforward to find a profession.It is believed that education is more essential than social skills when looking a job.In my opinion, I strongly support that both social skills and qualifications are equaly necessary. The ideas to clarify these views will be illustrated in this essay below.

To begin with the first reason that why qualification is necessary. Knowledge could be seem as the background and it is easier to train to a person who already have basic insight in certain field to match the job requirment. Therefore, the company can retain money and time on training . Beside, after training course, the company also has more advanced employees.The secondly reason that qualification can evidence that people has spent a long time in training. They have a lot of practice experience and have been trained to have a professional working attitude so it will be easier to work and interact with them.So that, when the boss has an important mission to entrust,they might be the person that boss trusts with tasks without worrying.

In addition, social skills are also necessary when looking a employment . You can not develop completely your caree without social skills . If a person only learns proffesion knowledge without interactions and communication. Good communication can create sympathy for your boss and colleagues. For example, an worker can create sympathy for customers thanks to skillful speaking. From that, people will complete all the assigned orders and may be promoted to higher position in the future.

In conclusion, having considered both views. I think those two factor are both views that will make people look the most outstanding when applying for a job.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Increasing the cost of fuel to decrease environmental pollution is a popular idea in many countries. In my opinion, while higher fuel costs may have certain effects, there are numerous methods to improve the environment. 

On the one hand, there are certain reasons why increasing the cost of fuel is beneficial. First, this may help reduce air pollution from vehicles. This is mainly because if the cost of fuel rises, people will use fewer personal vehicles. As a result, emissions from vehicles may decrease. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, people rarely use vehicles, so air pollution is significantly reduced. Second, the amount of pollution from many factories may fall. The main reason is that when the price of fuels increases, many factories will use different power sources which are environmentally friendly such as solar energy or wind power.

On the other hand, the government should adopt other methods to resolve environmental issues. To begin with, investing in public transport may be an effective way. When the public transport system is developed and modern, more people will use public transport. Therefore, the problem of air pollution may be lessened. Moreover, planting new forests and protecting current ones also help protect the environment. Every year, trees absorb a large amount of carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the environment. Also, the air may be fresh and conditioned by trees. Therefore, people should exploit forests rationally and prevent forest fires. 

In conclusion, although increasing the cost of fuel has a lot of benefits, the government should care about different factors affecting the environment.","### Task Achievement:

Some people think that governments should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"A group of individuals believe that country’s officials have to shed light on minimizing the toxicity of the environment and households and cure citizens from getting sick. I strongly believe that government officials must put their energy into tackling the toxicity on the air and households need because of two reasons which are locally and internationally.

The main reason why I believe that government have to solve the problem of toxicity in the air and their voter’s housing is that they have a local duty toward citizen which means that they are obliged to fdsa these needs. Furthermore, countries should have gone after citizen needs and one of the fundamental needs fds to live in an area where the air is clean and to have a place to sleep. Despite the fact, that government’s officials are citizens at the end.

Another reason why I think that countries need to solve any problem related to the environment and household so because they have an international duty toward their citizens. Obviously, most of the countries are in the United Nations and to be member countries have to agree to the United Nation’s rule. In fact, most of the rules are talking about what are  human needs such – housing, justice, safety, and health -; therefore, all countries must offer these needs to their citizen.

Human activities have negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem. Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Human being has always been abusing the mother earth since the industrial revolution. Almost every kind of environmental problem or animal distinction, are the negative result of human activities. Some people believe that we can still save our planet and immediate actions must be taken. Others think that these actions are just grasping at straws. In my opinion, both approaches are equally reasonable, but personal statements vary.

Some people believe that we can take proactive approaches to save plants and animals. For example, panda has once been taken as dangerous distinctive species, but with the effort of many zoologists, pandas are being transfered to a much safer environment, such as the zoo, witch can insure the conservation of them. Now, we can see pandas in zoos all around the world, the number of pandas are surely secured.

On the other hand, some people say that such actions can never keep up with the damages made by human. Some disruptions are irreversible, like the ozone hole, it takes centuries for it to recover. Before that, animals and plants may suffer from drought and forest fire. Moreover, according to Darwin’s Natural Selection, it is quite natural for animals to die out. Dinosaurs become extinct because of the volcano explosion, and it is unnatural to preserve them or even bring them back to life. We surely don’t want to see such horrible nightmares like the movie Jurassic Park to happen in real life.

In conclusion, some people nowadays engage in environmental events, and devoted themselves to protect the living creatures on earth. While some only take passive actions. I believe that although there are chances that these protective actions are useless, we should’t give up on doing so. If we don’t give it a try, we will never know what we can accomplish.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that watching television is bad for children. Other people believe that watching television is educational for children. Which opinion do you agree with and why? Give specific details and examples in your answer.,"In the contemporary era, opinions diverge on whether television is suitable for children. While some argue its educational value, I firmly believe that excessive TV viewing can be detrimental to a child's well-being, and I'll elucidate my stance with rationale and examples.

Firstly, the pervasive use of television and technology exposes children to potential health issues. Extended screen time strains young eyes, potentially leading to vision problems and various health ailments. Moreover, excessive TV consumption can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, increasing the risk of obesity and related health concerns.

Additionally, studies highlight the addictive nature of television, potentially impacting children's self-regulation and academic performance. Excessive viewing habits can lead to addiction, disrupting their focus on studies and negatively impacting their educational outcomes.

While television might offer some educational content, the adverse effects on health and academic performance outweigh these benefits. Although it can provide information, the risks of addiction and health concerns demand prudent limitations on screen time for children.

"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old. Discuss both views and give your opinion","In return to people’s devotion during the labour age comes opinion that government should subsidize them after retirement. Nevertheless, many support individuals self-charged to avoid burden to society. Although both views appear reasonable, I honestly believe governors must take care of old people

Those who assert that it is individuals charged to take care of themselves indicate the mitigation of financial burden. In simple words, as the life expectancy escalated gradually, countries with rapidly aging populations must allocate more money and resources to their health care systems. Consequently, this disproportionate amount of money substantially increased the burden on governments' budgets, which resulted in the collapse of existing funding to tackle pressing issues like the housing crisis or disease pandemic. A well-known example includes India, where a surge in welfare and publicly funded programs hinder existing systems from handling the growing prevalence of chronic diseases while also addressing the needs of large and expanding senior populations. 

Nevertheless, a leading cause to deny this argument is the reimbursement for retirees' perseverance during their labor age. Norway's high welfare payments are a salient example of high taxation returns in generous public assistance. At this place, people enrich the national budget by devoting their time and effort to the country's development, meaning that citizens contribute to taxes raised. The authorities can distribute these taxes further to develop their country, such as building hospitals, upgrading infrastructure, and paying for officials. The result is that by way of compensation for old contributors' devotion in their youth, money-related assistance and care services are introduced to the elderly, for example, free-of-charge health checkups or retirements home. It implies that governments’ subsidies provision appears acutely pivotal as recompense for labor’s dedication.

In recapitulation, even though the personal accumulation alleviates the strain on public funding, it cannot disclaim the urge to equipped senior civilians with proper welfare programs in response to their determination. Thus, it is necessary to grant elderly an expense to meet demands on leisure and healthcare systems at their retirements","## Task Achievement:

"Employers should give their staff at least a 4-week holiday a year to make employees
better at their jobs. To what extend do you agree or disagree?","It is suggested that employees should be given at least a 4-week annual leave to imporve their working efficiency. While I understand the importance of having regular breaks, I disagree that the holiday should be as long as 4 weeks.

On the one hand, knowing that after a long time of dedication rewarding will be awaiting, employees will have motivations to work harder and put more efforts into their jobs. It can also be mentally beneficial for people. For example, an employees nowadays are always under tremendous pressure for they have to work overtime frequently. They spend almost all of their time on their jobs that they do not have time for their family and friends. Giving them a certain days of vacation would help them balance work and life better and therefore release their stress and tension. It can hence be argued that providing employees holiday is beneficial.

On the other hand, a 4-week holiday is too long for the company that it may affect the normal operation of the company, and even the whole society. For instance, the modern society is moving so fast that every second a new idea could be launched. Employers are competing with one another on a timely basis. With the position being vacant for a minimum of one month will definetely be harmful for the productivity and efficiency of the coroption. Moreover, it may also arise contradictions between colleagues. If the team members have to cover tasks left by the person who is on long vacation, it will increase the already heavy workloads of these members and result in low efficiency.

"Some people say that increasing business and cultural contacts between countries is a positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","There is no doubt that these days countries are increasing their trade and cultural connections. Some believe that it is a positive thing while others disagree with this idea. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and I will share my personal opinion.

In terms of advantages, countries opening up to each other has many benefits. First, it made people understand and care for each other more. To illustrate, many recent reports showed an increase in tolerance among people in open societies. Secondly, multiple goods are now freely traded between the east and the west. This made those goods cheaper in price and more affordable. Gadgets and technology innovations spread immediately to be used all over the world.

On the other hand, while increasing connections between counties have its benefits, it also carries its own downsides. It turned the world into a global village. people can hardly differentiate between cities since most of them almost look and feel the same. In other words, travelling has lost most of its appeal. On top of that, small local businesses could not compete with large factories that are producing in China. Many of them could not maintain their businesses and had to close. In the long term, this is damaging to local economies.

In conclusion, although increasing cultural contact and opening up trade between countries is beneficial, it has its side effects. I believe that it is useful to increase business contact with some limits. I also believe that culture should be unique to each country and should be protected.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Metropoles has been suffering from  traffic for a long time. Despite the known causes, the number of  precautions taken is not sufficient.  

Unlike the past,  numerous vehicles are producing in order to ensure  public transportation and carrying goods. To begin with, the needs of trucks surged due to provide unlimited human desires such as foods, raw materials, finished industrial materials, technological devices, and clothes. For example, the population of the world was low in contrast to the now, therefore more foods and products were produced in the past. In this context, there are fewer vehicles were needed to use. However, the type of the products are variated, and more goods are manufactured, and a huge amount of the plants is cultivated, hence the vessels are needed more than before.  Secondly, the population of the urban were raised because of the movement from rural areas. Consequently, the number of cars, busses and trains went up to carry the people between the places.

Significantly,  overusing vessels can cause myriad problems like air pollution, contamination of water resources, and the quality of foods. The published researches indicate that the main reason for  pollution is the producing greenhouse gases and the crucial source of the gases are using petroleum and its derivatives. Particularly, the trucks use petroleum products, produce more gases, and have severe effects on the environment.

Even if the precautions are more costly to eliminate the causes, it is easy to implement. First, the time of the engine can be reduced. For instance, the engines can be stopped out of working times. Second, environmentally friendly trucks can be manufactured like hybrid cars. Finally, the emigration from rural areas to the cities can be minimized.

İn conclusion, the overusing of vessels have the ability to damage the environment. İf the communities desire to decline negative effects, they should take precautions.","## Task Achievement:

People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"In the modern world a community show a tendency to become parents in middle age. This essay will argue that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. The essay will argue that the background received to mature ages makes the process of growing children more conscious and uncomplicated which is more beneficial for families than weak sides that are related to declining a health condition in that age.

It is commonly known that in their 30s people usually accumulate sufficient experience, have a stable job and some properties.  That's all can be considered as bright sides for planning pregnancy, because families in most cases don't have big financial difficulties anymore, they are more prepared to be parents than in younger ages when probably they would be busy building a career or finishing education. A recent British survey showed that women who started their motherhood after 30 years old feel happier and more confident having offspring than those who did it earlier. Another point might be the ability to take responsibility for such important decisions which make planning children more conscious and morally prepared. As a result, children in such families are growing up in more favourable conditions getting enough attention and appropriate upbringing.

Despite so many advantages, having children at older ages may be challenging due to some health issues. Possibly, older parents don't have so much energy as youngsters and after 30 years people more often face chronic diseases which make parenting time slightly more complicated compared to young parents. However, a lot of personal examples prove that this drawback can be solved easily by taking care of a health and preventing some predictable conditions with a family doctor.

To conclude, the fact that older parents are more prepared mentally and physically to have children clearly outweighs the potential health issues which can be prevented in advance.","## Task Achievement:

"Studies show that many criminals have a low level of education. For this reason, people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they can get a job when leave prison.

Do you agree or disagree?","People frequently discuss how education and bad behaviour are linked. Several studies suggest that if someone lacks education, they might be more likely to do incorrect things. This has led people to believe that teaching those in prison can prevent them from committing crimes again after they are released. However, I disagree with this idea. This upcoming article will share my viewpoint prior to reaching a conclusion. 

Primarily, one main reason for the belief that education can reduce lawlessness is that getting a good education can lead to better job opportunities. Nevertheless, things do not always go as planned. Let us consider John as an example, a fictional person who spent time in prison. He learned a lot while behind bars, even earning a certificate in computer programming. Consequently, when he tried to find a job after his release, people still saw him as someone who caused trouble because of his past. Hence, education alone may not change how people view those who have been in trouble previously, making it hard for them to fit back into regular life. 

Moreover, while education can help with several issues, it cannot solve everything. Research shows that misdemeanour has numerous reasons, like not having an abundance of money, growing up in a difficult family, or struggling with personal problems. For instance, a study from the National Institute of Justice found that numerous people who go back to committing crimes after jail have problems with drugs or their emotions. Thus, only teaching them might not be enough to stop them from going back to felonies. We need to consider the bigger picture and provide help with other things too. 

To sum up, although teaching people behind bars might sound like a good idea, it might not be the only solution. Education can offer opportunities; on the contrary, it cannot promise success for those who have had problems previously. Therefore, in my opinion, providing education might not be helpful since crime has various reasons, like money, family, and feelings, beyond merely.","## Task Achievement:

Task 2: Some people think that young people should be required to do unpaid work helping people in the community. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, the young should volunteer to help people in the community. Despite some drawbacks of this decision. I think that the benefits are more significant.

On the one hand, there are a number of major disadvantages of working in the community without salary. One evident strength is that it would make the young discouraged. In other words, when they work in the society without salary, they will feel discouraged and they also do not have the effort to continue working. Another reason is that they will not focus on their studies. The young who are too focused on their work, they will not concentrate on their studies at university. This leads to they can not being able to graduate because of bad academic result.

On the other hand, I argue that there are some obvious advantages that would make it better not to volunteer to help people in the community. Firstly, this allows the young to see the various aspects of life when they realize that many people around them do not have the basic necessities of life, they will learn to count their blessings. These activities help them gain insight into the lives of the poor, realize how fortunate they are. Consequently, they will have a higher sense of responsibility with the community. Secondly, volunteering is a great opportunity to acquire valuable work experience. They can mention these stents in their resume when it is time to apply for a job. In addition, the young who have done some kind of community work are more likely to get hired than someone who has absolutely no experience of volunteering.

In conclusion, although the young might find it difficult to work in the community without being unpaid. I believe that the merits of this trend do outweigh those drawbacks.","### Task Achievement:

Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"Many people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial for both individuals and society as a whole. Personally, I disagree with this opinion.
Working as a volunteer has become increasingly popular among teenagers. I agree that this can help them to fulfill their free time. On the other hand, studying is more important than doing unpaid work and most of them find it extremely hard as a compulsory studying. If individual teenagers had free time, they would do sports instead of doing unpaid work. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies. 
On the other hand, those who think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work, they pressure on them and it can cause resentment amongst teenagers and society. Furthermore, I do not agree that society would benefit from unpaid work as a whole. To force young people to work as a volunteer could be counterproductive and parents would be dissatisfied how to rise their children. Encorcement on teenagers can gain nothing for the young and society. For example, recent survey on how enforcement can be devastating effect on children states that roughly over 50 percent of teenagers leave home to escape their parents' pressure. It shows us that doing unpaid work under pressure is not optional for both.
In conclusion, despite the requirement that some people think about unpaid work, I do believe that studying is also as unpaid work for teenagers and to avoid pressure is more important than making this compulsory.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Ageing is one of the inevitable difficult parts of life which must be experienced by every human being in the world. Due to the advancement of the medical field, life expectancy has been raised gradually in many countries in the world including developing countries. But unfortunately, caring for the elderly population is becoming a huge problem in every corner of the globe. 

when people are getting old, they tend to develop non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Moreover, ageing will lead to memory impairment and they become dependent on others not only for their physical needs but also for psychological support as well as finance. Actually, the young generation of each family should care about the senior citizens of their family. However, in this modern world, most seniors are neglected by their offspring due to several reasons. 

Many decades ago, there was a thick bond among blood relations which connected each member in many aspects. people lived in extended families rather than nuclear households. This strong bond protected the geriatric population very well. 

In contrast, nowadays, households are scattered and each member acts individually. Parents and grandparents are not spending adequate time with their children and grandchildren due to the busy schedules of their jobs. Therefore, the relationship is split which pushes the senior citizens to a bizarre living in the latter part of life. Most of the ageing population is looked after by elders' homes or community centres. 

Some people still believe that the youngsters of each generation should take responsibility to look after their seniors and legislation should be made to ensure the safety of seniors. However, it carries a lot of pros and cons. 

But I believe that  making  good relationships among family members will teach the younger generation how to care for their parents and grandparents rather than making rules.","## Task Achievement:

Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action improve situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. ?,"There are tremendously controversial perspectives heating up a debate over what human’s next move is after bringing immense influence on flora and fauna species. While some people hold a strong claim that nothing we can do in this day and age because it is too late, the opposite makes a statement that with a view to revamping the situation, some efficient activities should be implemented.

Without a shadow of a doubt, there is an eclectic mix of convincing reasons which contributes to a notion that it is too late to treat those pressing consequences rooted by humans on plants and animals. They account for those irresponsible and selfish actions ranging from urban sprawl to overgrazing, especially deforestation. For the time being, there is an ever-growing demand for lands to live as well as woods to consume, which breeds abundant species on the verge of extinction and some may have died out already. Pandas in China which are on the brink of extinction nowadays can be cited as a suitable instance. Pupils had set fire to the forests, chopped down a majority of trees on their own purpose, by doing so, those poor pandas consequently lost their home to where they used to settle. Hence, due to a great many persuading roots, it is fairly late for humans to fix what they have done to flora and fauna.

Whilst the negative effects which are bred by humans are widely acknowledged, some effective approaches in order to redress that urgent matter still lingers. There are plentiful reserves that have been put up in order to provide a safe environment for those endangered faunas. Under the government’s observation, Cuc Phuong reserve has been built and become a home for a considerable species ranging from common to rare ones. Thus, proper tactics to cope with these dire issues always exist, however, it depends on how much pupils want to make it come true.

In conclusion, it has never been too late for humans to try to repair their mistakes in the past even with the simplest action, the most pivotal thing is people’s awareness.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.

Additionally, when the firms have more mechanical person, they don't have to worry about the office space hereby minimizing the expenditures.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Should teenagers be required to unpaid work in time, when they are not studying? Should they do any community work for no money? In my opinion the answer is absolutely clear and it is – no. I strongly believe that unpaid job does more harm than benefits.

Each job must be paid. It does not matter whether it was done by adult or by a teenager or child. The job that is paid well is always done more accurate and clear. Some may argue that children can do this unpaid work for some reasons but I totally disagree with those statements. Paid job is a good way for teenagers to learn some aspects of adult life. If they learn it in childhood it would be easier for them when they grow up.

Of course job for community benefits both teenagers and community. But it does not cancel the fact that unpaid job is wrong. For example parents can give some money for children who do any community work. So teenagers would be able to help the community and at the same time they will earn their own money. It will help them in their future, when they would not underestimate their capabilities. They will also learn that money are not so easy to earn as they may think. I have no doubt that it will improve relationships between parents and their children.

In conclusion I would like to say that parents should pay their children’s unpaid community work if they want their children to grow mentally health and hardworking.","## Task Achievement:

To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Nowadays, some people think that technology is complicating our lives. They also think we should lead a basic lifestyle with no technology. Personally, I completely disagree with this view.

For a variety of reasons, firstly, the advancement in technology makes our work easier. When we need a meeting to coordinate the work, we just need to sit in a place and join a meeting room online. This helps us save time to move. Secondly, modern technology helps us communicate with everyone in the world. Take Facebook as an example, we can talk with our families and friends who are distant apart from us with a video sharing option. Thirdly, innovations in aviation sector has made our travel time much shorter and more relaxed

More and more people are becoming serious overweight. Some people think that a solution can be to increase the price of fattening food. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, a considerable number of people are gaining weight significantly. It is thought by some that a surge in the cost of food items that cause obesity, is the possible way to takle this problem. In my opinion, I consider that overweight issue of people can not be mitigated by price increase of products because people's yearning for those food products is difficult to control.

To begin, these days people enticed by junk fast food and various other products that are responsible for tremendous weight gain. Some people believe that rise in the price of these junk food could dissuade people to buy these things but I disagree due to several reasons. People, who love to eat junk food, purchase these food regardless of their cost. For example, if someone is addicted to drink fizzy soft drink that contain high sugar such as, Coke, Pepsi and several others, then person could not stop drinking of these drinks evenafter surge in their prices.

Moreover, these days, people are leading highly paced extremely busy life with hectic schedule and they are having considerable less time to cook, therefore, they love to order food items from fast food outlets that adversely affect their health. For instance, due to shortage of time, people generally buy Pizza, Burger etc, from resturants and this habit of regularly having these meals, has a deterimental impact on physical and mental well being.

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"In recent years, an increase in the manufacture of consumer goods has been seen. While this is connected to population growth, it has resulted in an increase in a detrimental effect to the environment. In this essay I will look at 2 possible causes for this as well as suggest some solutions. 

Due to the extreme high volumes of manufacturers in order to meet the increasing demand of products, there has been an increase in factory produced CO2 gases. This is because the manufacturing processes have not become more efficient as quantities have risen. In China for example, many new factories have sprung up over the last few decades resulting in huge quantities of pollution being fed into the air. If factories were to spend funding on researching more efficient manufacturing processes, the amount of polluted air would be decreased. Manufacturers in their numbers, should concentrate on reducing CO2 production. 

With the increase of factory workers, there has been a matching increase in the transportation of these workers to the facilities. In addition to this, there is an obvious rise in the transportation of products, all of which has resulted in higher Carbon gas emissions form vehicles involved in the process. The number of busses and trucks carrying labourers to and products from the factories in China have added to the already polluted atmosphere in the country. Improved and more efficient vehicles using no fossil fuels, such as in electric vehicles, or less fuel will improve this situation. Transportation accounts for a large percentage of the worlds total carbon gas production.

While it is understandable that we need more manufacturing facilities for the ever-increasing world population, we need factories who take environmental issues seriously. Factory management need to ask themselves the question, ""are we doing enough to minimize our carbon footprint?","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Youngsters should spend quality time on the volunteer work during their leisure time.

While few argue that,spending time in social work is not feasible one ,however, I strongly believe that involving social activities  makes them responsible citizens and they could contribute more to society.

To begin with,Contributing the social work which makes them more responsible person to their future growth.This is because it proliferates  social skills such as respecting elder people and assisting the injured person.For example,recently students collected the welfare funds and donated that money to the education of  Africa and other developing countries.In addition,team skills might be developed while working in social activities that should be optimally beneficial to their growth.As a consequence,while preparing for their job interview ,they could highlight their contribution to the community 

and utilize their team skills which help them to  acquire the job.

However,sometimes social activities build  boring thoughts with youngsters.The reason is interesting factors are not included in the social activities and they did not pursue any direct benefits from those work.For instance,youngsters spend the whole day collecting the funds without any appreciation for their efforts which leads to  a lack of interest in that one.As a result, the population started showing interest in browsing social websites and gaming videos which keep them engaged in other activities.

In conclusion,although some people have a low tolerance for boredom,volunteer work should be necessary for  every individual which constructs a healthy and accountable society across the world.Government should create more awareness programs for the people to participate the social activity program to help  society.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career; while other believe that, it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give y0ur opinion","Some people think University or College is one of the important sector for a student which help them to make their future bright while other believe that after finishing the school student should involve in work directly rather than going to university. This essay will discuss on both views and explain why university education plays a crucial role in achieving career goal rather than going for job after school level.
In one hand, studying at university will make learner more responsible as they become more mature after school life, which fascinate them to achieve their career goal. Furthermore, the student will get more opportunity to learn more about the subject in which they are keen. For instance, student who wants to persuade their career in the engineering field can learn more about the math and physics subject. Therefore, it will be easier for them to work practically if they have theoretical knowledge. Moreover, they will become more serious about their goal so for the successful life they will study hard. Hence, university study is importance for their goal achievement for prosperous and success career.
In other hand, many people believe that they should indulge in a fieldwork after finishing their school life. Many people think this because they believe it will aid younger people to learn practically. Moreover, they will earn money to feed themselves and the family burden can be decrease. Furthermore, they use to analyse theoretical study is not imperative if they got jog with good salary. For instance, a recent study concluded most of the people want their children to finish their school and search for employment to make them independent rather than admitting them in university.
However, in mine opinion education always make humankind generous and successful. So more we study, we get more knowledge especially in case of children. If they choose college after school study, they can make a choice of the subject according to their interest and can motivated to grab more information in related field. Hence, they can easily achieve their goal if they do their further study in college.

Some people think that illegal Internet downloads are having a negative effect on the music industry. Others feel that they have little or no impact on artists. Discuss both views and give your own opinion,"Nowadays, it is a very common to download from the internet and it is becoming a topic of debate whether it is legal or not. However, while many advocates that music piracy doesn’t effect on the music industry, I side with those who believe that it does affect the music industry as a whole.
On one hand, it could be argued that download music from the internet is not illegal and it doesn’t affect the music industry because they have multiple sources of income. Many artists create videos or songs just as a hobby. Likewise, many artists do live shows or advertisements, their main income sources are not just music. Hence, supporters of this claim that download from the internet doesn’t affect much to them.

On the other hand, I hold the opinion that download music from the internet is illegal and it significantly affects the music industry because to make any song is expensive. Many people work behind to make an album and artists needs to pay for the staff, advertisement fees and rent. If people do not buy their album legally, artists will not able to pay them and in the end artists will get bankrupt. In other words, they will stop making music albums and people might lose great artists.  Thus, in my opinion, people should not download music from the internet illegally.

To conclude, although some musical artists make albums as a hobby or they do not rely on one source of income, Music downloading from the internet without paying for, it causes the whole industry will not survive in the future.

Some people find advertisements amusing or annoying and they are not influenced by this when they shop. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Advertising and its influences have long been a topic of numerous debates, especially in recent years. In this regard, some people argue that the impact of advertisements on shoppers is neglectable. However, in contrast, the majority number of people including me hold the view that advertisements could channel the shoppers' choices in an effective way. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will support this point of view with likely explanations.

To begin with, it is widely accepted that the modern human is leading a consumerism lifestyle due to indulging in social media platforms and being bombarded with commercials offering an excessive range of products. This means that huge enterprises meticulously target individuals, particularly younger consumers, with impressive adverts on social media platforms such as Instagram and Telegram. As a result, this level of omnipresence of new products with gimmick options makes it inevitable for young people who spend most of their time surfing the internet. The latest statistics in the UK, for instance, have demonstrated that nearly 60% of people who spend a certain time on the internet buy at least one or two items every month under the direct influence of online advertisements. 

Furthermore, the fact advertisements could be functional in terms of making customers aware of various features, options and models of available products in the market. Thanks to the informative form of adverts, people have an opportunity to compare different items they need in terms of prices and features to make the best decision, which would have not been possible otherwise. This trend is quite beneficial for both individuals and companies as it increases sale figures and boost the economy in society. Apart from that, driven by advertisements, the time devoted to shopping sprees has diminished substantially due to the fact that before attending the malls or shops people exactly know which items and brands they want to purchase. For example, when I have to buy a mobile phone I  do not waste my time in the shop since, thanks to the adverts and pops on the Internet, I am already familiar with the exact features, costs and quality of every available smartphone in the market which makes the process of buying in the shop significantly lower.

To sum up, despite the fact that a minority group of people do not trust adverts anyway, in my opinion, most people, especially younger ones are affected by advertisements since not only it could enhance their knowledge about different goods but also  can stimulate demand and interest to newly produced items.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. 
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","People’s opinions differ as to whether students should continue to study higher education or obtain a job right after school when they completed high school. While there are benefits to have a job straight after graduating school, there are also good reasons why it might be beneficial to study further. 
On the one hand, the option to gain a job after completing school is attractive for several reasons. Firstly, it is one of the best ways to train students to become mature people. For instance, they have to think more critically about each decision and have responsibility with the consequence without the support from family or teachers. Secondly, having a job could give the students a whale of opportunities to expand the relationships, earn practical experiences, knowledge from the reality that is extremely useful for them in the near future.  Thirdly, students will appreciate the value of money, so they will change the mindset and understand the challenges that their parents suffered. 
On the other hand, there are a variety of reasons why keeping on studying further is also necessary. First, students could obtain the academic degree which is important to apply for a job with a high salary in the future. For example, according to the statistics of the Viet nam ministry of education, 40 percentages of graduated students gain at least 500 dollars at the starting wage for a job straight after school. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that study in higher education provides more job opportunities, career progression, and therefore an improved quality of life . Finally, the students could have a chance to acquaint themselves with many experts in some specific fields, so they could learn more knowledge, acquirements which are very useful for them in the future.

"5.6. Some people think that robots are very important for humans' future development. Others, however, think that robots are a dangerous invention that could have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Over the last two or three decades, the way people live and work has changed dramatically due to major advances in technology. As a result, it is believed by many that robots play a significant role in the development of the nation whereas others think that it is a negative advancement and has adverse impacts on humanity. In this essay, I will look at both sides of the argument and give my opinion.

To start with, why do individuals consider the development of machines beneficial for society is the advancement of lifestyle because they have made life easy and time-saving. In addition, robots have the ability to do error-free tasks which results in the productivity and efficiency of the task. For example, automatic machines are used in all industries to fasten the work and reduce the labour force. As a result, companies can increase their productivity and growth. 

On the other hand, using robots in every field can have detrimental effects on people's lives because they do not have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong and work on emotional intelligence only which can result in the loss of lives. Moreover, the unemployment rate will increase with the growth of robots in every field which is harmful to the public because they will take the place of human forces and people will no longer be required in industries to perform various tasks.

Government spends a lot of money on education. More money should be spent on free time activities. To what extent do agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that the government need to invest money in education, whereas others believe that more money should be spent on leisure activities. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my opinion. 

On the one hand, there are two main reasons to explain why government funding is necessary.First of all, it will help children have equal education opportunities, especially in mountainous areas. Many parents do not have enough conditions to pay for the school fees of their children as a lot of children do not know how to write and read. In addition, investing in education means investing in the future because it helps young people have more and more opportunities to improve their knowledge. 

On the other hand, funding leisure activities will help citizens release from overstress or depression. In modern society, young people are stressed by many factors such as relationships and peerpressure, especially when they struggle with many exams and hard homework. The government needs to provide some entertainment channels and other facilities. school can build a place thathas a cafe for students during break time. They can relax and spend time with their peers due to having more energy for study. From that, learning will become easier and more effective.

 In conclusion, the government should spend money on education as well as entertainment, both of which will help children develop wisdom and mental health.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find

a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many years have seen a change in climate and few people believe that they have to look for other alternatives to living with climate change rather than restricting it. I strongly oppose this view and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, restraining climate from changing is basically the only way we can have a chance to save the world  since it causes weather changes in the future. This will stop the human race from extinction due to harsh weather caused by climate change. For instance, if we try by all means to avoid air pollution this can actually help to prevent the climate from changing which will cause drought due to too much radiation from the sun. Furthermore, we can limit climate change by helping stop the ozone layer from continues breaking and causing deadly direct sunlight. For example, human beings can do programs for planting trees everywhere which  will assist in avoiding the destruction of the ozone layer.

On the other hand, we can learn to survive  the changing in the climate since beings are created in a way that adapts to change. Thus when there are extreme weather conditions caused by the change of climate we can always find means to survive these dangerous atmospheres, when it is too cold we put on warm clothes.

In conclusion, I believe that preventing the changing of the weather bears more weight than devising ways to survive in the conditions due to the reason that people can plant more trees and avoid polluting the air this will stop the climate from changing. However, we can learn to survive harsh weather.","## Task Achievement:

Children today have more responsibilities than the past. Some people think it has positive effects than negative ones while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"In the past children used to have more responsibilities in comparison with the current situations. Some have the idea that it has more benefits than what is occurring nowadays. From my point of view, the given responsibilities should be limited to what a child can handle.

Having more responsibilities can prepare children for life. Due to the numerous duties that kids may be in charge of, life skills are encouraged and developed in a more effective way. Being influenced by the experience gained, the children are wiser to take appropriate measures to solve any issue imposed . In Japan, the education system promotes being responsible by encouraging the students to clean their school as part of their daily routines. Children who are used to taking more responsibilities can act more accurately in life.

On the other hand, the reduction in the number of duties may provide more time for children to play which is fundamental to their mental health. We need to consider more time to play for children, if we want to have healthier children. Having numerous duties is harmful to their mental health as their capacity to handle and deal with many tasks is limited. In Africa, there are many kids deprived of childhood as they have to work like  grown-up adults. Play is vital for every child as it brings satisfaction and happiness.

In conclusion, although some have the notion that preparing children for life by giving them different responsibilities is crucial, I think the need to play should considered as the first priority for any child.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay tax to the state.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Tax is the important source of government’s revenue. It is said by some individuals that they should not pay tax  to government and keep their money with themselves. I strongly disagree with the statement and my viewpoints on this  issue will be elaborated in the aforementioned paragraphs.

To begin with,  tax is fixed according to the income of the people if they will not pay the tax then  rich will  become more richer and poor will become more poorer and it will definitely create the problem of inequality of income and  wealth.For instance  a survey was conducted in India in 2017 and its result was that India  faced the problem of tax evasion  in which usually people do not pay tax and find the way to hide their income and this problem had given birth to several problems such as hoarding of black money in foreign countries and exploitation of  poor by rich people.

Furthermore, there are some advantages of  collecting tax for  the government.Firstly, it is the  source of government’s income and regime can utilise this money for the welfare purpose of people  and this money can be used to built public parks, amusement parks , building bridges.Secondly , taxes are compulsory to make balance between the rich and poor otherwise rich will become more rich and poor will become more poor.

The only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"Road safety has become a pipe dream for most individuals living on Earth. Every day a significant number of people become victims of accidents thus making it a global concern. Although a plethora of steps has been taken to alleviate these mishaps, the number of casualties has not declined yet. Some people hold the view that punishing drivers is the only way to ameliorate road safety, while I believe that it is necessarily not the only solution. This essay tends to explain the reasoning behind my viewpoint.

To begin with, drivers are not the only persons to be blamed for these casualties, highway conditions are also responsible. Nowadays, streets are constructed with substandard materials, accordingly, potholes are formed during the rainy season. Similarly, ongoing maintenance of streets leaves behind dug-up roadways without any proper barricades. The unavailability of street lights also exacerbates the problem. For instance, recently an Indian girl died when her scooter slipped into a hole because of the darkness around. 

Additionally, inferior vehicle conditions contribute to accidents. For example, in Bangladesh, most public buses are 10 to 20 years old. Despite severe technical issue, they are still running on the highways. So, in times of emergency, it is impossible for the operators to stop the vehicle. In worst scenarios the buses can collide with another automobile, killing all the passengers on board. Moreover, there are no organised  traffic regulations and highway patrol in most cities hence no security. Due to dysfunctional traffic lights, the crossing of pedestrians and cars coincide resulting in misfortunes. Considering all these, the government should be held blameworthy as it is the authority's responsibility to provide safer public transportation and systematic traffic rules.

To conclude, mishaps are caused not only by reckless driving but by several other factors. Improved roadways, vehicles and laws are indispensable to enhance the safety of our roads. Therefore, I disagree with the given statement.","## Task Achievement:

Admittedly, part of urgent problems only can be trackled by cooperation with other countries. The assistance of internation is more powerful and immidated.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In recent times, people from many nations across the globe have become more intrigued by the former events of their residences. Concerns of safety and means to maintain household facilities are the primary reasons that trigger the growing curiosity. This essay will elucidate the intentions as well as outline the mediums to successful research.

The main reason why individuals are interested in the background of their property is to feel a sense of security. To further explain, the house or the apartment could have been a place where a criminal resided or where a terrifying crime took place. Hence, to avoid unnecessary doubts and attain clarity, the new tenants investigate the history. The second factor would be to supplement the management of the facilities since the previous owners may have blueprints of the water, electricity, and heating systems. For instance, if something were to break and the layout of the system is available, it can be troubleshot and get fixed easily.

In turns of research methods to acquire the history of the residence, the internet is probably the most convenient platform. There are multiple websites and blogs where one can find the record of ownership or what the location used to be before the residential area was built. An inquiry to the neighbours would be another simplistic way in researching. For instance, some probably have lived in the community or the building for decades, therefore, they are likely to have all the answers. Lastly, the local property authorities can also provide accurate and detailed information to the requestors since they are accountable to keep the records and data.

To conclude, individuals are more curious about the place that they are residing in to feel secured and for the smoother maintenance of the household facilities. In order to acquire those facts, they can rely on the world wide web, converse with their neighbours and request to respective authorities.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people argue that we should do research into their family history. Others, agree with the view that we should focus on the present and future generations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There are two controversial perspectives heating up a debate over history. While some people claim that it is essential for individuals to conduct studies into the history of their family, others make a statement that concentrating the present and next generations is necessary. From my viewpoint, each has its own redeeming features, so it is optimal to combine those.

Without a shadow of a doubt, we should pay attention to the history of our ancestors. Because it allows people to have a firm grasp of their cultural identity and some traditional customs of their family. For example, in Vietnam, when Lunar new year comes, a steady stream of adults regularly take their toddlers to some churches adjacent to their houses in order to offer incense and provide children with the family historical background. Hence, having a good understanding of the family history is of paramount essence. 

While the imperativeness of taking notice of the history of family is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if the importance of focusing on the present and posterities. Since the offspring will follow in their ancestors’ footsteps and have job orientations. For instance, in Vietnam’s society, there are myriads of families having a private corporation and lucrative businesses. Hence, their descendants can inherit this legacy and continue conducting the traditional career of the family. Hence, laying stress on the younger generations is quite necessary in this day and age.

In my conclusion, while some assume that investigating the family history is crucial, other people say that specialising in the youngsters is of necessity.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.","Perhaps, the greatest threat in the world today is not the nuclear bombs, Terrorism, political instability, population outbreak or regional conflicts but it is the climate shifts and environmental degradation. According to me, The last thing a human should do is find a way to live with this and do nothing about it.

To begin with, The frequently occurring storms, Rising temperature in the Arctic, Ozone layer degradation, rising sea level and El-Nino effects in some coastal areas are leading to the one major climate change and if not prevented, it would cause animal extinction one day. We have already harmed the environment to a great extent, but now it's time to come together and solve this crisis in order to secure the future of animals on this planet earth. The sudden flood in U.S regions, rising droughts in African countries and frequent storms in Asian areas are increasing than ever before. According to the 2001 report, Global warming would cause the sea level rise up to 4 feet by 2025 which can cause major Tsunamis in many areas and would likely to cause the extinction of many regions.

Furthermore, extinction caused crisis are maybe little farther for now, but there are so many other issues to which we have to deal with right now. Deforestation and use of some coal, fuels are one of the major issues today. We cannot ignore these concerns and just live with it. These are the major factors which are responsible for Environmental pollution and temperature rising.

In addition to control this crisis, Countries should work together. Establishment of panels and setting some ground rules against deforestation and usage of some harmful materials globally, can reduce damage. Industries have to take strict actions against not using any chemicals and waste materials should not go into water sources.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","There is a growing trend whereby residents are researching the history of their homes. This is due to a natural curiosity and practical concerns and should be done through official channels.

Many are interested in the past of their home because they desire to link with history and are worried about potential structural faults. The first reason is analogous to exhaustively studying family genealogy. By researching one’s ancestors or place of residence, it is possible to understand and establish a connection with the past. Moreover, there is a pragmatic reason related to historic construction methods. Older homes, in particular, may have employed unsafe techniques or materials that will degrade, creating the risk of structural damage and, in the worst cases, collapses. By learning about the house and the period when it was built, residents can take the necessary steps to ensure the house is structurally sound.

The method for carrying out such specialized research involves requesting local records. It is possible to do initial research through “word of mouth” and collecting relevant stories in a community. However, this information may be unreliable, and therefore an individual should endeavour to contact their local building authorities. In most countries, it is possible to register  freedom of information requests and receive the required documents from municipal offices. Governments have little incentive to protect such information and are likely to be receptive and helpful in offering assistance. Residents can then be assured they have the most trustworthy information possible in order to better understand the history of their home and any possible defects in its construction.

To conclude, some today gather information concerning the history of their home to understand the past and guarantee their safety. This development is advisable and the authorities should comply and encourage such fact-finding.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Presently, the planet is suffering from a number of environmental issues, namely climate change. Thus, some suggest that it is better for people to adopt to this circumstance and live with it, rather than preventing environmental problems. To certain extent, I am inclined to agree with this statement. 

Some people believe that certain measures can be taken, the effects of which may prevent the climate change. Precisely, people should be encouraged to be eco-friendly consumers. For instance, individuals can use public transport or electric cars, and avoid using motor cars, which pollute the air. Besides, large companies and factories, which its operation highly depends on fuels, can sue renewable energy sources. For example, Intel, famous manufacturing computer processors, has now become one of the largest companies that use green energy. Therefore, individuals should take actions to stop the climate change. 

Meanwhile, it is though that people should fine a lotion to live with this situation. In other words, scientific developments and technologies can assist people to live these environmental issues, such as soil contamination and heat wave. To illustrate, if farmers cannot harvest crops because of poor quality of soil, scientists will produce them in the advanced laboratories. Furthermore, in order not to suffer from heat wave during summer months, governments can construct underground motorways and pathways for drivers and pedestrians. The suggested methods can serve people to live with climate change. 

In conclusion, although it is suggested several ways that may help people to live with climate issues, it is widely believed that individuals and governments should tackle the problems by taking certain effective measures. On balance, I think both people and governments collaborate, it is will be possible to improve the current situation of climate as well as to find ways to live with certain environmental issues, like heat wave, which takes much time and effort to be solved.","### Task Achievement:

Some people think that robots are important for humankind's future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In this age of technocracy, among many wonderous inventions, robots have proven to be the most promising of them all. Many deem it to be a worthy addition to our lives, but contrarians to this notion believe that, it can prove detrimental to our society. In this essay, I will ruminate on both sides, before making my statement.

Those  who consider robotics to be vital for the advancement of civilization, do so by observing several quality-of-life changes brought by it. Such as, the integration of rudimentary assembly line machines used for product manufacturing. Moreover, there exist self-driving cars, waiting to revolutionize methods of transportation. Additionally, there have been major strides in the development of life-like androids. All in all, the future seems bright indeed according to these supporters.

However, trepidatious ones vouching against this technological progress, do so by witnessing drawbacks brought by these gizmos. Like, mass lay-offs caused by the introduction of automatic tools in many factories around the world. Furthermore, these people do not look favourably at the idea of automation in vehicles, as they are wary of hazards associated with it. Also, they hold fast to the belief that, there will come a day when automatons will completely render human talent superficial. As an example, the advent of artificial intelligence art (AI art) has filled artists around the globe with dread, as they think that they will soon be replaced by their man-made counterparts.

In many places women are taking jobs which are traditionally done by men. What do you think make these changes happen? What is your opinion about it?,"Traditionally, Men and Women were trusted with a certain list of tasks based on their capabilities during the start of the human race. But we have come across thousand years of evolution and yet, we still have more reservations to make jobs to be gender-neutral . We will discuss  the facts of how the trend is changing and what are the factors contributing to the change.

The first and the most important feature impacting point in  today's world is money. Because of that, In ,families it is presumed that whoever earns will be assumed as leader of the family and due to that there are considered invincible and independent. Most of the oppression against women were staged pointing to them that they were not the breadwinner of the family. To be freed from this vicious cycle, the workforce in every other industry has been boosted by female employees. It empowers them with independence and helps make their own decisions rather than being dependent on men,

Second, the individuality of the people is often perceived based on the nature of their employment. Feminine was always considered as the weakest of all in terms of physical and mental strength. Because of this perception of communities around us, they were never allowed to pursue their dreams. On the contrary, this thinking has motivated females of all ages to prove everyone wrong and change the status quo.

In conclusion to the points listed, the jobs should never be based on  gender, it should rely on the abilities which should be tested rather than assumed. Our generation has kicked off this transition of breaking women into industries to support them and also reap the benefits out of it.","### Task Achievement:

"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Being interested by researching the history of the home where people lives is a unsual trend in some countries. At first let’s see the reasons that push them to find out about history of their home. 

Some people lives in old towns where the history was very important, like old capitals. They can discover important things about others families, they could be politician, writers, kings, or simple farmers. It’s a way to obtain souvenirs from the past, to give to their house a personality and a spirit. IF people discover that their house used to be a house of a famous person or of an important person the value of the house will change and they can sell it and earn lot of money. The house could be given to the government like a heritage for the citizens. Some people are unhappy in their life in their house, they think about mysterious things, they hear voices and they belive that their own house is habitated by gosts and spirits, they try to know a soul it history for solving their problems. 

Now we can speak about the way that can help them to research into this subject. The first way to help people to know about things nowadays is internet. It is the easiest way to begin a research. They can try to have information on the town, then on the neibourhood and at least on their own house. The other way and the best way for obtaining serious informations is to go to the council of the town and do a requiest. Normally, each town or each region has his archieve, They can try to go there and to read about their town maybe they will discover that their own house was something important. In my opinion it is very hard to have information about our own house mostly about it history, but if it was built on a archeological site it could be a good idea to do research on it. Trying to find information on internet, by our council, in the archieves, or with the help of a notary can be useful to them and to the country.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is believed by certain people that in spite of reversing climatic effects,individuals should learn to get used to it.In my opinion,I completely disagree with this perspective as it can lead to detrimental effects upon ,both the environment and  society.

The predominant reason why folks need to work for the rejuvenation of  nature and prevent further damage is that it will not only safeguard the flora and fauna from the adverse effects of global warming but also ensure the safety of humans. In other words,living with the same conditions without making any efforts to reverse the damage that has been already done ,can significantly disturb the whole life cycle.For example, it is stated by Einstein that if bees die due to ever-increasing pollution, the survival of human beings is also not possible within the next five years ;therefore, the government has formulated various policies and intervented techniques to protect bees numbers from declining ;as a result, pollination has increased tremendously which help in lowering the earth's temperature.

Another reason why masses should not learn to adjust to the depleted environment conditions as it raises the risks of health ailments.According to the studies, cases of skin cancer has been inclined from the past due to depletion of the ozone layer and easier access to UV rays on the earth surface.In this context, resisting the use of fossil fuels and preventing deforestation cannot deteriorate conditions in the future.However, it is difficult for people to come out of their comfort zone and take responsibilities for the damage they had caused but working together to make the world a better place can have positive outcomes for them and for the coming generations.

Some people think that climate change could have a negative effect on business. Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views give your own opinion.,"Recently the Global Warming issue has been one of the most discussed topics and divided people into two groups based on their opinion about the damage done to the business by worldwide problems. Some individuals believe that global problems have a harmful impact on business and economics in general, while others think that they provide new opportunities for companies' development.

 

On the one hand, negative effects on the agriculture sector from atmosphere fluctuation can be observed nowadays. Heavy rain or no rain for any specific crop caused a bad effect on farming which results in a farmer being poorer. In addition to this, it also affects the nation where the demand is high for the food and the supply becomes low because of damage. For example, shortage of seafood in food malls. As a consequence, switching of weather affects business majorly.

On the other hand, such sector as tourism has beneficial consequences for global warming. Due to the fast climate change and melting glaciers in cold parts of the planet, people try to catch their last opportunities to visit cold countries hence it develops business. For example, travelling to Antarctica seemed to be an unaffordable vacation for the majority; however, its popularity had  significant growth in the last years with the help of people who are ready to give their last money to see ice blocks.

In conclusion, I believe that global issues have more cause a big loss to companies than bring positive effect to their evolvement, except for some specific sectors.","### Task Achievement:

Some believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically  financially and mentally unable to look after themselves.To what extent do you agree or disagree,"Legally some experts argue that ,young people are obligated to care for the older folks when they are financially,physically and psychologically having challenges and cannot look after themselves.In this write up I strongly disagree with this position .

To begin with,those who are not in support of this argument believed that the Elderly should have an insurance policy against their old   age ,so that they can depend on this insurance each time they need it ,instead of the younger people using their expenses for that .For instance, as one get older they are prone to a lot of disease so this insurance can cater for them.

Moreover,the government is responsible in supporting the aged.This is because the burden of the aged if put on the younger members of the family will make it difficult for them to be financially free.The governments would raise fund to support the aged and employ people to cater for them. For example, Building of a geriatric home for the aged will relieve the burden from young family members.

Despite the fact that it is the responsibility of the young people to care for the aged those in support of this argue that,the elderly have invested in the younger people ,so showing love and support is what they need from the younger ones.This point is not sustainable because there are elderly ones who do not care or invested in their children and expect them to do so as they are physically psychologically and financially unable .

"Many people today are choosing to travel to other countries.
Why is this happening?
Is this a positive or negative development?","Nowadays, people show more tendency to have a tour to other lands around the world. From my perspective, this advance has both positive and negative aspects.

Firstly, by virtue of airplane improvement and development, any destination abroad is accessible with affordable cost and lowest time. In addition, these days, holiday destinations have many advertisements and promotions to attract tourist globally; is that, the number of people choosing foreign countries has been increased significantly instead of local ones.  

Another reason for travel tendency to other countries is the people’s high demand of studying, working and living overseas these days generally. Not only there are many parents taking peril to support their children to study abroad, but also there are many teachers encouraging students to pursue their targets in other lands. Thanks to the global process, many hurdles such as culture, language and frontier have been narrowed and leads to society’s enthusiasm in travelling to other countries.

In my opinion, the reasons described above should be seen as a process with both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, holidaymaking provide high rate of wealth which promotes tourism industry dramatically. Furthermore, it boosts competition in jobs, culture adoption and conventions homogenization, which raise development in many social aspects.

"In some contries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","As we can see that people are fond of the story behind the place they live in. There were numerous effects of learning history, such as rising one’s awareness, knowing one’s origin and so on. This essay will examine the rationale and the method of a proposal with a wide range of perspectives and provide logical conclusions.

On the one hand, nowadays, history is not only a subject taught at school but also inside  buildings or  houses. People must learn about history otherwise they do not know their origin as well as the victorious past of their ancestors. For example, some people are heiresses, if they are curious about the history of the house they live in, they will understand how their ancestors set up with untiring efforts. Moreover, history drives people to an action that protects their house, their loved ones or even their nation. 

On the other hand, citizens live in the fourth industrial revolution thus it is easy to access  technology such as online websites, Facebook, online newspapers or watch videos on Youtube. As a result, people just need a mobile phone with the wifi connected then they can find out the knowledge that they want to absorb. In addition, if citizens did not use technology devices, local people will tell them a wonderful narrative story. Another source to discover history is to go to the museum which persuades dwellers to be proud of their culture and liberty.

For instance, a medical director who wants to employ a doctor in a hospital will accept only those that graduated with a medical diploma.

On the other hand, opponents think that it is better to get a job after secondary school because it increases the years of experience. The earlier someone starts working the more the get accustomed to their profession. For example, some professions such as drivers and nail technicians require years of practice and experience in order to do well in their field. 

I am of the opinion that it is preferable to have a higher education so that one can earn an attractive salary. Most skilled workers earn more than the unskilled labourers. It is known that those who gets a higher education spends a huge sum of money in school. Therefore, it is reasonable that they should be paid well. To illustrate this, in developed countries, a banker's income is greater as opposed to a cleaner.

In conclusion, even though there are arguments on if people should get a certificate from an educational institution or start working after high school,  I reiterate my opinion that it is better to earn a degree because it gives better jobs and salaries. Therefore, people are advised to start considering entering college.","## Task Achievement:

"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to sent their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extend do you agree?","Single-sex education is an aproach that is gaining popularity these days. Although there is no unified verdict on wheter it is beneficial or disadvantagtous to children today, I think, students being in same-gander schools may have difficulties later in life. In this essay I will explain my opinion.

      Some parents believe that by eliminating the distractions it becomes easier to retain the knowledge that teachers offer. That is why they do not want their children to be in co-educational schools, because, espesially at pubert period, students of the opossite sex can be a distraction. In addition, these students tend to not feel the preassures of gender roles and learn to pursue areas that interested them no matter what is considered socially acceptable for their biological sex. Despite this, I consider,  the average workspace does not make men and women work in separate corners. There is an expectation for everyone to work together.

   From my point of view,  the school environment is a place where young generation learns what life will be like when thay enter the the real world. Having both men and women in classes allow students of both sex to interact with a wider range of people and learn how to work with and talk to people of the opposite sex.  Same-gander classes limit this opportunitu.

  Taking everything into consideration, I cannot agree with the idea that one gander education is better for children, because they do not have an opportunity to learn communication skills with opposite sex.  Although, it may be easier for students to participate actively and do well academically at a one-sex institution, the real life is not single-sex.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In the present age, many people believe that art plays a vital role in children's lives and should be mandatorily included in their subject at educational institutions while others think it's not necessary to include it as a subject. This essay will highlight the merits and demerits of art subject in kids life at school. In my opinion, I support the former statement.

On the one hand, individuals think that  art is an essential subject for teenagers as it helps them to express their views and emotions through colours and pencils. Moreover, art also helps them in improving their learning methodology. Meanwhile, with the help of sketching and paintings juveniles can show their creativity to the world. For example, Artist Tahsin Akhtar, painting got selected in the U.K animal welfare art gallery for showing the cruelty towards the animals.

On the other hand, the community think that children nowadays are fully loaded with their studies, and should more concentrate on subjects which will help them in future thus, wasting time on arts subjects. Eventually, making drawings and paintings consume a lot of time and kids gets tired and as a ,result teenagers are not able to focus more on studies. Such as, my nephew takes 5-6 hours in completing a drawing which not only makes him tired but after a time inactive also as as a result, he scored fewer marks in other subjects.

In conclusion, Art plays an important role in one's life, as they can share their emotions and unsaid words through paintings but on the other ,hand it takes a lot of time which impact juvenile study. In my opinion, art should be a necessary subject for children at school as it helps them to open up in a society with their art style.","**Task Achievement:**
