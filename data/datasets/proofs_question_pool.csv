"14. How many positive integers $n$ are there for which $\left(2022+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}+\left(25+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}$ is an integer?

A three-digit number, with distinct and non-zero digits (say $a b c$), is called petaloid if there exists an integer $n \geq 1$ such that the number $c b a \underbrace{00 \cdots 0}_{n \text { zeros }}$ is a multiple of $a b c$. The smallest $n$ that makes this divisibility true is called the flower of $a b c$.

Example. The number 132 is petaloid, as 132 divides 23100. Since 23100/132 = 175 is an integer but $2310 / 132=17.5$ is not, the flower of 132 is 2.

(a) Let $a b c$ be a three-digit number (with distinct and non-zero digits) of the form $2^{x} \cdot 3^{y} \cdot 5^{z}$ with $x, y, z$ non-negative integers and $y \leq 2$. Prove that $a b c$ is petaloid.

(b) What is the maximum value of the flower of a petaloid number (of three digits)?

(c) Let $a b c$ be a petaloid number. Prove that $a b c$ is not divisible by 13.

## PROOF PROBLEM

Let $A B C$ be a triangle, $r$ the internal angle bisector of the acute angle $\widehat{B A C}$, and $K$ the projection of $B$ onto $r$, $L$ the projection of $K$ onto $A B$, and $D$ the reflection of $B$ with respect to $L$. Finally, let $H$ be the foot of the altitude of triangle $A B C$ from $B$. Prove that:

(a) $B H=2 L K$;

(b) $K A$ bisects the angle $\widehat{H K D}$;

(c) the triangle $A D H$ is isosceles.

"4. Consider some intermediate step in Kuzia's movement. If she is at point $A$ at this step, the probability of being in $A$ on the next step is zero. If, however, she is at any of the remaining points, $B, C$ or $D$, the probability of being in $A$ on the next step is $1 / 3$, since from each such point there are three equally likely paths, only one of which leads to $A$. Let $p_{k}$ be the probability that the flea is at point $A$ on the $k$-th step. Accordingly, the probability that she is not at point $A$ is $\left(1-p_{k}\right)$. Then on the next step, she will be in $A$ with the probability

$$
p_{k+1}=\left(1-p_{k}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{3}+p_{k} \cdot 0=\left(1-p_{k}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{3}
$$

Thus, $p_{0}=1, \quad p_{1}=0, \quad p_{2}=\frac{1}{3}$, and further we get

$$
p_{3}=\left(1-\frac{1}{3}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{9}, \ldots, p_{n}=\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{27} \cdots+\frac{(-1)^{n}}{3^{n-1}}
$$

The formula for $p_{n}$ when $n \geq 2$ can be proven by mathematical induction.

Base case: $p_{2}=\frac{(-1)^{2}}{3^{2-1}}=\frac{1}{3}$ - true.

Inductive step: Suppose the formula is true for $n=k$, that is, $p_{k}=\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{27} \cdots+\frac{(-1)^{k}}{3^{k-1}}$. Then

$$
p_{k+1}=\left(1-p_{k}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{3}=\left(1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{27}+\cdots-\frac{(-1)^{k}}{3^{k-1}}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{3}=
$$

$$
=\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{3 \cdot 3}+\frac{1}{9 \cdot 3}-\frac{1}{27 \cdot 3}+\cdots+\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{3^{k-1} \cdot 3}=\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{27} \cdots+\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{3^{k}}
$$

Thus, the formula is also true for $n=k+1$. Therefore, it is true for any $n \geq 2$. We see that $p_{n}$ represents the sum of the terms of a geometric progression with a common ratio of $-1 / 3$. Consequently, $P(A)=p_{2020}=\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1-(-1 / 3)^{2019}}{1-(-1 / 3)}=\frac{1+(1 / 3)^{2019}}{4}=\frac{3^{2019}+1}{4 \cdot 3^{2019}} \simeq \frac{1}{4}$.",1a7a2d5f-bbcb-5da1-8849-fcd592af9ea4,Algebra,proof,olympiads,\frac{3^{2019}+1}{4\cdot3^{2019}}

"5. Let $D$ be the set of real numbers excluding -1 . Find all functions $f: D \rightarrow D$ such that for all $x, y \in D$ satisfying $x \neq 0$ and $y \neq-x$, the equality

$$
(f(f(x))+y) f\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)+f(f(y))=x
$$

holds.

Solution: Plugging in $x=y \neq 0$ yields $f(f(x))=\alpha x$ for some constant $\alpha$. This holds for all $x \neq 0,-1$. If $\alpha$ was any real number different from 0 or 1 , we would get $f(f(-1 / \alpha))=-1$, which is a contradiction. Hence, only $\alpha=0$ or $\alpha=1$ are possible. In the former case $x=1, y=0$ gives a contradiction, so $f(f(x))=x$ for all $x \in D, x \neq 0$. Letting $x=1, y=f(1)$ gives $f(1)=0$ and so $f(0)=1$. Now, for all other $x$, we can plug in $\frac{1}{x}$ instead of $x$ and $y=1$ to obtain $f(x)=\frac{1-x}{1+x}$ (this formula now also works for $x=0$ ), and we can verify that this is indeed a solution:

$$
f(f(x))=\frac{1-\frac{1-x}{1+x}}{1+\frac{1-x}{1+x}}=\frac{1-x-(1-x)}{1+x+1-x}=x

Let \(a\) be a given positive real number.

For a function \(f\) defined for all real numbers \(x\), it is assumed that it satisfies the following conditions (1) and (2):

(1) For every real number \(x\), \(f(x) + f(x + a) = 1\).

(2) There exists a real number \(c\) such that for all real numbers \(x\) that satisfy \(c < x < c + \frac{1}{2}\), \(f(x) < \frac{1}{2}\) holds.

Prove that from these assumptions it always follows:

The function \(f\) is periodic; there is a smallest possible period of \(f\).

Determine this smallest possible period of \(f\).

Hint:

A function \(f\) is called periodic if and only if there exists a positive real number \(p\) such that for all real numbers \(x\), the equation \(f(x + p) = f(x)\) holds.

If this is the case, then any positive real number \(p\) for which this holds is called a period of \(f\).",8dcdc926-878b-5d40-8708-6369aeb59a9d,Algebra,proof,olympiads,2a

Let's proceed step by step to prove this.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Circles $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ touch internally at point $A$.
   - Circle $O_{1}$ has diameter $AB$.
   - Circle $O_{2}$ has diameter $AC$.

2. **Understand the concept of external similarity:**
   - The point of external similarity of two circles is the point where the external tangents to the circles intersect.
   - For circles with diameters $O_{1}O_{2}$ and $BC$, we need to show that this point is $A$.

3. **Analyze the geometry:**
   - Since $A$ is the point of internal tangency, the line segment $O_{1}O_{2}$ passes through $A$.
   - The diameters $AB$ and $AC$ are such that $A$ is a common point on both circles.

4. **Consider the homothety:**
   - The homothety centered at $A$ that maps circle $O_{1}$ to circle $O_{2}$ will map point $B$ to point $C$.
   - This homothety also maps the line segment $O_{1}O_{2}$ to itself, as $A$ is the center of homothety.

5. **Determine the external similarity point:**
   - The external similarity point of the circles with diameters $O_{1}O_{2}$ and $BC$ is the point where the external tangents to these circles intersect.
   - Since $A$ is the point of internal tangency and the homothety maps $B$ to $C$, the external tangents at $B$ and $C$ will intersect at $A$.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the point of external similarity of the circles corresponding to the diameters $O_{1}O_{2}$ and $BC$ is indeed $A$.

Thus, we have shown that the point of external similarity of the circles corresponding to the diameters $O_{1}O_{2}$ and $BC$ is $A$.

For example, consider the identity $(1+x)^{2n}=(1+x)^{n}(1+x)^{n}(n\in N^{*})$, the coefficient of $x^{n}$ on the left side is $C_{2n}^{n}$. On the right side, $(1+x)^{n}(1+x)^{n}=(C_{n}^{0}+C_{n}^{1}x+\ldots+C_{n}^{n}x^{n})(C_{n}^{0}+C_{n}^{1}x+\ldots+C_{n}^{n}x^{n})$,

"\section*{Problem 2 - 290922}

The fields in the diagram are to be filled with three white and three black stones, one stone per field. Furthermore, a natural number \(a \geq 1\) is given.

Starting from the colored field, counting clockwise, the stones are to be counted from 1 to \(a\).

The stone that receives the number \(a\) is removed.

Then, the counting starts again with 1 at the next stone in the clockwise direction, and again, the stone that receives the number \(a\) is removed.

This process of counting and removing is repeated a third time. It is important to note that empty fields are not counted but skipped.

a) Let \(a=4\). How should the stones be initially distributed so that the three white stones remain at the end?

b) Someone conjectures: ""If \(a\) is replaced by \(a+6\), the same initial distribution of stones will also result in the three white stones remaining.""

Disprove the conjecture by verifying it for \(a=4\)!

c) Prove that there exists a number \(z\) such that for any \(a \geq 1\), the following statement is true: ""If \(a\) is replaced by \(a+z\), the same initial distribution of stones - also starting the count from the colored field - will also result in the three white stones remaining.""",d72ab71d-b5b5-5618-a487-25dadb2c9d8f,Combinatorics,proof,olympiads,60
