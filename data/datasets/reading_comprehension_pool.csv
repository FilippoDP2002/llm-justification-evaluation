RCQ1,RCP1,"According to the passage, theory B states that which of the following is a factor that enables a schooling fish to escape predators?
(A) The tendency of fish to form compact groups
(B) The movement of other fish within the school
(C) The inability of predators to detect schools
(D) The ability of fish to hide behind one another in a school
(E) The great speed with which a school can disperse",B,"Supporting idea

This question depends on understanding what the passage states about theory B, the “confusion effect.” One element of theory B is that predators may experience sensory confusion created by large numbers of moving fish in a school.

A The compactness of groups of schooling fish is an element of theory A, not theory B.
B Correct. It is the movement of schooling fish around a predator that creates sensory confusion in the predator; this movement may distract the predator and help protect individual fish in the school.
C According to the passage’s description of theory A, predators are actually slightly more likely to detect schools than they are to detect individual fish.
D Theory B does not involve fish hiding behind one another but rather moving around the predator.
E The passage does not discuss the speed of dispersal of schools of fish.

The correct answer is B.","Biologists have advanced two theories to explain
 why schooling of fish occurs in so many fish species.
 Because schooling is particularly widespread among
 species of small fish, both theories assume that
 schooling offers the advantage of some protection
 from predators.
 Proponents of theory A dispute the assumption that
 a school of thousands of fish is highly visible.
 Experiments have shown that any fish can be seen,
 even in very clear water, only within a sphere of 200
 meters in diameter. When fish are in a compact group,
 the spheres of visibility overlap. Thus the chance of a
 predator finding the school is only slightly greater
 than the chance of the predator finding a single fish
 swimming alone. Schooling is advantageous to the
 individual fish because a predator’s chance of finding
 any particular fish swimming in the school is much
 smaller than its chance of finding at least one of the
 same group of fish if the fish were dispersed
 throughout an area.
 However, critics of theory A point out that some
 fish form schools even in areas where predators are
 abundant and thus little possibility of escaping
 detection exists. They argue that the school continues
 to be of value to its members even after detection.
 They advocate theory B, the “confusion effect,” which
 can be explained in two different ways.
 Sometimes, proponents argue, predators simply
 cannot decide which fish to attack. This indecision
 supposedly results from a predator’s preference for
 striking prey that is distinct from the rest of the
 school in appearance. In many schools the fish are
 almost identical in appearance, making it difficult for a
 predator to select one. The second explanation for
 the “confusion effect” has to do with the sensory
 confusion caused by a large number of prey moving
 around the predator. Even if the predator
 makes the decision to attack a particular fish,
 the movement of other prey in the school can
 be distracting. The predator’s difficulty can be
 compared to that of a tennis player trying to
 hit a tennis ball when two are approaching
 simultaneously."
RCQ2,RCP1,"According to the passage, both theory A and theory B have been developed to explain how
(A) fish hide from predators by forming schools
(B) forming schools functions to protect fish from predators
(C) schooling among fish differs from other protective behaviors
(D) small fish are able to make rapid decisions
(E) small fish are able to survive in an environment densely populated by large predators",B,"Supporting idea

The passage states in its first paragraph that two theories were developed to explain why schooling occurs in so many fish species and that they both assume that schooling helps protect fish from predators.

A While theory A involves an explanation of how schooling makes an individual fish less likely to be found by predators, theory B explains how schooling protects fish even when they are detected by predators.
B Correct. Both theory A and theory B begin with the assumption that schooling provides protection from predators, and each theory offers a different explanation for how that protection occurs.
C The passage does not discuss protective behaviors other than schooling.
D The decision-making ability of predators, not schooling fish, is discussed in the passage; schooling is presented as an instinctive behavior.
E The passage suggests that only theory B helps explain schooling behavior in environments where many predators, large or otherwise, are found, and that theory A explains schooling in areas where predators are not as abundant.

RCQ3,RCP1,"According to one explanation of the “confusion effect,” a fish that swims in a school will have greater advantages for survival if it
(A) tends to be visible for no more than 200 meters
(B) stays near either the front or the rear of a school
(C) is part of a small school rather than a large school
(D) is very similar in appearance to the other fish in the school
(E) is medium-sized",D,"Inference

The “confusion effect” is discussed in the third and fourth paragraphs. The first explanation of the “confusion effect” proposes that because predators prefer to select distinctive prey, they find it difficult to select one fish from among many that look the same.

A The 200-meter visibility of fish is part of the explanation for theory A, not theory B (the “confusion effect”).
B The location of an individual fish within a school is not discussed in the passage as being important to the “confusion effect.”
C The size of a school of fish is not discussed as an element of the “confusion effect.”
D Correct. Because predators, according to the “confusion effect,” prefer to select prey that is distinct from the rest of the school, a fish that is similar in appearance to the other fish in its school would most likely enjoy a survival advantage.
E The size of a fish relative to the other fish in its school would most likely contribute to its ability to survive: that is, if it resembled other fish in size, it would be safer, based on what the passage says about the “confusion effect.” Furthermore, the passage gives no reason to think that merely being medium-sized would confer any advantage (unless the other fish were medium-sized as well).

Determining the author’s primary concern depends on understanding the focus of the passage as a whole. The author presents two theories that purport to account for why fish, particularly small fish, tend to school and explains the arguments of proponents of each theory.

A Correct. The author discusses two theories—identified as theory A and theory B—that account for the tendency of fish to school.
B The author is not concerned with different techniques in the passage.
C The two theories of why fish school could be referred to as hypotheses, but the author is not primarily concerned with defending them; rather, the passage explains how each attempts to account for the phenomenon in question.
D The author presents, rather than refutes, beliefs about why fish tend to school.
E The author reveals no evidence, new or otherwise, in the passage. The passage is a general discussion of scientific opinions based on existing evidence.

RCQ5,RCP2,"The primary purpose of the passage is to
(A) explain why a particular business strategy has been less successful than was once anticipated
(B) propose an alternative to a particular business strategy that has inadvertently caused ecological damage
(C) present a concern about the possible consequences of pursuing a particular business strategy
(D) make a case for applying a particular business strategy on a larger scale than is currently practiced
(E) suggest several possible outcomes of companies’ failure to understand the economic impact of a particular business strategy",C,"Main idea

This question requires understanding the passage as a whole. The passage starts out defining a goal—ecoefficiency—that has become popular among companies throughout the world and that would be expected to bring overall ecological benefits. It then immediately introduces Senge and Carstedt, who have concerns about this idea. The rest of the passage is devoted to explaining their concerns, though the passage does not present a particular alternative strategy.

A The passage never discusses whether ecoefficiency is or is not successful but only the possible consequences of it.
B Lines 26–28 state that Senge and Carstedt believe that a new systemic approach must be found, but a particular alternative strategy is never offered.
C Correct. After defining ecoefficiency, the rest of the passage is devoted to describing the concerns Senge and Carstedt have about it as a goal for companies.
D The passage reports on particular concerns about the strategy and does not advocate expanding its adoption.
E The passage is concerned with environmental impact, not economic impact.

The correct answer is C.","Ecoefficiency (measures to minimize environmental
 impact through the reduction or elimination of waste
 from production processes) has become a goal for
 companies worldwide, with many realizing significant
 cost savings from such innovations. Peter Senge and
 Goran Carstedt see this development as laudable but
 suggest that simply adopting ecoefficiency
 innovations could actually worsen environmental
 stresses in the future. Such innovations reduce
 production waste but do not alter the number of
 products manufactured nor the waste generated
 from their use and discard; indeed, most companies
 invest in ecoefficiency improvements in order to
 increase profits and growth. Moreover, there is no
 guarantee that increased economic growth from
 ecoefficiency will come in similarly ecoefficient ways,
 since in today’s global markets, greater profits may
 be turned into investment capital that could easily be
 reinvested in old-style eco-inefficient industries. Even
 a vastly more ecoefficient industrial system could,
 were it to grow much larger, generate more total
 waste and destroy more habitat and species than
 would a smaller, less ecoefficient economy. Senge
 and Carstedt argue that to preserve the global
 environment and sustain economic growth,
 businesses must develop a new systemic approach
 that reduces total material use and total accumulated
 waste. Focusing exclusively on ecoefficiency, which
 offers a compelling business case according to

 pursuing radically different products and business
 models."
RCQ6,RCP2,"The passage mentions which of the following as a possible consequence of companies’ realization of greater profits through ecoefficiency?
(A) The companies may be able to sell a greater number of products by lowering prices.
(B) The companies may be better able to attract investment capital in the global market.
(C) The profits may be reinvested to increase economic growth through ecoefficiency.
(D) The profits may be used as investment capital for industries that are not ecoefficient.
(E) The profits may encourage companies to make further innovations in reducing production waste.",D,"Supporting ideas

This question asks for identification of an example given in the passage of what could result from the greater profits that may come with ecoefficiency. Such profits are specifically mentioned only in lines 14 and 17. The increased growth and profits referred to in line 14 are associated with increased waste generated indirectly by ecoefficient companies. The growth and profits referred to in line 17 are associated with investment of this capital in industries that may not be ecoefficient.

A The prices of companies’ products are not mentioned in the passage.
B Greater investment in ecoefficient companies by outside sources is not mentioned in the passage.
C The passage mentions increased profits from ecoefficiency but not the use of these profits to then increase growth through further ecoefficiency.
D Correct. Lines 14–19 state explicitly that company profits from ecoefficiency may be invested in eco-inefficient industries.
E The passage does not discuss whether companies will use increased profits from ecoefficiency to become more ecoefficient.

The correct answer is D.","Ecoefficiency (measures to minimize environmental

RCQ7,RCP2,"The passage implies that which of the following is a possible consequence of a company’s adoption of innovations that increase its ecoefficiency?
(A) Company profits resulting from such innovations may be reinvested in that company with no guarantee that the company will continue to make further improvements in ecoefficiency.
(B) Company growth fostered by cost savings from such innovations may allow that company to manufacture a greater number of products that will be used and discarded, thus worsening environmental stress.
(C) A company that fails to realize significant cost savings from such innovations may have little incentive to continue to minimize the environmental impact of its production processes.
(D) A company that comes to depend on such innovations to increase its profits and growth may be vulnerable in the global market to competition from old-style eco-inefficient industries.
(E) A company that meets its ecoefficiency goals is unlikely to invest its increased profits in the development of new and innovative ecoefficiency measures.",B,"Inference

The answer to this question will be an inference about what may result from a company’s increased ecoefficiency. The passage suggests several outcomes from such an increase: a general worsening of the environment; a tendency for companies to manufacture more of particular products, which will then be thrown away by consumers; the possibility that increased profits will result in greater investment in industries that are not ecoefficient; and even the possibility that ecoefficiency might allow so much growth that more total waste will be produced and more overall wildlife habitat destroyed.

A The passage suggests generally that ecoefficiency will increase companies’ profits, but there is no suggestion that these companies will therefore then abandon ecoefficiency as a goal.
B Correct. Lines 6–12 strongly suggest that it is possible that the increased growth that may come from ecoefficiency may result in more products being manufactured, which may result in more waste as those products are discarded by consumers.
C The passage does not suggest that ecoefficiency may fail to increase a company’s profits.
D The passage suggests that ecoefficiency has allowed many companies to increase profits, but it does not suggest that eco-inefficient companies are more profitable or competitive in the global marketplace.
E As with answer choice (A), there is no suggestion that companies are likely to abandon ecoefficient strategies once they have realized increased profits from such strategies.

(E) attempt to explain a commonly misunderstood biological phenomenon",D,"Main idea

This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole. The passage begins by describing a long-held belief regarding humans’ circadian rhythms: that the SCN control them. It then goes on to explain that new findings have led scientists to believe that other organs and tissues may be involved in regulating the body’s circadian rhythms as well.

A The passage does not challenge the more-recent findings. Furthermore, the recent findings that the passage recounts do not contradict earlier findings; rather, when placed alongside those earlier findings, they have led scientists to reach additional conclusions.
B The passage does not discuss a two-sided debate; no findings or conclusions are disputed by any figures in the passages.
C There is only one question at issue in the passage: whether the SCN alone control human circadian rhythms. Furthermore, nothing in the passage suggests that researchers have been puzzled for a long time about this.
D Correct. The new evidence regarding circadian rhythm–related gene activity in all the body’s tissue has led scientists to revise their long-standing belief that the SCN alone control circadian rhythms.
E The biological phenomenon of circadian rhythms is not, at least as far as the passage is concerned, misunderstood. Its causes are being investigated and refined.

The correct answer is D.","Scientists long believed that two nerve clusters in
 the human hypothalamus, called suprachiasmatic
 nuclei (SCNs), were what controlled our circadian
 rhythms. Those rhythms are the biological cycles
 that recur approximately every 24 hours in
 synchronization with the cycle of sunlight and

 demonstrated that in some animals, the SCNs
 control daily fluctuations in blood pressure, body
 temperature, activity level, and alertness, as well as
 the nighttime release of the sleep-promoting agent
 melatonin. Furthermore, cells in the human retina

 levels to the SCNs have recently been discovered.

This question asks about what is NOT specifically mentioned in the passage with regard to functions regulated by the SCN. Those functions, as identified in the passage, are blood pressure, body temperature, activity level, alertness, and the release of melatonin.

The author of the passage discusses the SCN in the passage in order to explain that they are most likely not, as long believed, solely responsible for the control of our circadian rhythms.

A The author states that the SCN are nerve clusters in the hypothalamus, and nothing in the passage contradicts or undermines the supposition that they are only in the hypothalamus.
B Correct. The author points out in the second paragraph that the SCN control core circadian function, but that circadian clocks found elsewhere in the body have an effect as well.
C The evidence offered in the second paragraph about the activity of the clock gene in rat livers suggests that these clock genes are not under the SCN’s control. The passage does not suggest that the SCN control any of the non-SCN controllers of circadian rhythms.
D The author states in the second paragraph that scientists do not dispute the idea that the SCN regulate blood pressure.
E The first paragraph indicates that the SCN respond to light levels; clock genes in other tissues are the ones that may respond to other external cues.

RCQ11,RCP4,"According to the passage, the difference in the amount of cratering on Callisto’s and Io’s respective surfaces can probably be explained by the difference between these two moons with respect to which of the following factors?
(A) Size
(B) Ice content
(C) The rate of bombardment by comets and asteroids
(D) The influence of Jupiter’s other moons
(E) The level of geological activity",E,"Supporting idea

Cratering is discussed in the second paragraph. The passage states that Callisto is heavily cratered, while Io has no detectable craters. Io is the moon closest to Jupiter, and Callisto is the farthest away. Their relative positions are accompanied by a corresponding difference in geological activity: Io is very geologically active, while Callisto is not active at all. Io’s geological activity means that it is being regularly resurfaced, so it is unlikely to retain any evidence of cratering—unlike Callisto, which experiences no resurfacing, leaving its craters intact.

A While the passage makes clear that Callisto is larger than Io, it does not address whether their relative size explains the difference in their respective amounts of cratering.
B According to the passage, Callisto and Io differ in terms of their ice content, but nothing in the passage indicates that that content affects the cratering on their surfaces.
C The passage states that Io experiences a higher rate of bombardment than Callisto does, but while that bombardment most likely causes cratering on Io, its surface does not retain those craters. Thus, the rate of bombardment does not, in itself, explain the difference in cratering on the surface of the two moons.
D The only other moons of Jupiter discussed in the passage are Ganymede and Europa, and the passage does not consider their effect on the cratering of Callisto and Io.
E Correct. Because Io experiences a high degree of geological activity, its surface is continuously resurfaced, which means that the surface shows no craters. Callisto, on the other hand, is not geologically active and thus is not resurfaced regularly, which explains why its surface is heavily cratered.

The correct answer is E.","Io and Europa, the inner two of Jupiter’s four
 largest moons, are about the size of Earth’s moon
 and are composed mostly or entirely of rock and
 metal. Ganymede and Callisto are larger and roughly
 half ice. Thus, these four moons are somewhat
 analogous to the planets of the solar system, in which
 the rock- and metal-rich inner planets are distinct from
 the much larger gas- and ice-rich outer planets.
 Jupiter’s moons are, however, more “systematic”:
 many of their properties vary continuously with
 distance from Jupiter. For example, Io is ice-free,
 Europa has a surface shell of ice, and while
 Ganymede and Callisto are both ice-rich, outermost
 Callisto has more.
 This compositional gradient has geological
 parallels. Io is extremely geologically active, Europa
 seems to be active on a more modest scale, and
 Ganymede has undergone bouts of activity in its
 geological past. Only Callisto reveals no geological
 activity. In similar fashion, Callisto’s surface is very
 heavily cratered from the impact of comets and
 asteroids; Ganymede, like Earth’s moon, is heavily
 cratered in parts; Europa is very lightly cratered; and
 no craters have been detected on Io, even though
 Jupiter’s gravity attracts comets and asteroids
 passing near it, substantially increasing the
 bombardment rate of the inner moons compared to
 that of the outer ones. But because of Io’s high
 degree of geological activity, its surface undergoes
 more-or-less continuous volcanic resurfacing."
RCQ12,RCP4,"Which of the following best describes the purpose of the second paragraph of the passage?

(E) To contrast the characteristics of Jupiter’s four largest moons with the characteristics of the planets of the solar system",A,"Evaluation

This question depends on understanding how the second paragraph functions in the context of the passage as a whole. The first paragraph discusses the way in which the composition of Jupiter’s four largest moons varies with distance from Jupiter, and the second paragraph extends the idea of distance-based variation to geological activity and surface appearance.

A Correct. The second paragraph presents evidence related to the amount of geological activity and surface cratering in order to extend the first paragraph’s suggestion that the characteristics of Jupiter’s four largest moons vary systematically based on their distance from Jupiter.
B The passage does not offer a theory to account for the systematic variation in the characteristics of Jupiter’s largest moons; it merely describes several instances of that variation.
C The second paragraph provides more examples of the systematic variation in the characteristics of Jupiter’s largest moons rather than explaining that variation’s significance.
D The passage describes Jupiter’s moons but does not identify any conventional assumptions about those moons that are contradicted by facts introduced in the passage.
E The first paragraph suggests that Jupiter’s moons exhibit differences in characteristics that are more “systematic” than are those of the planets in the solar system, but the characteristics are not themselves contrasted; in fact, the first paragraph suggests that they are similar. The second paragraph does not discuss the planets of the solar system at all.

The correct answer is A.","Io and Europa, the inner two of Jupiter’s four
 largest moons, are about the size of Earth’s moon
 and are composed mostly or entirely of rock and
 metal. Ganymede and Callisto are larger and roughly
 half ice. Thus, these four moons are somewhat
 analogous to the planets of the solar system, in which
 the rock- and metal-rich inner planets are distinct from
 the much larger gas- and ice-rich outer planets.
 Jupiter’s moons are, however, more “systematic”:
 many of their properties vary continuously with
 distance from Jupiter. For example, Io is ice-free,
 Europa has a surface shell of ice, and while
 Ganymede and Callisto are both ice-rich, outermost
 Callisto has more.
 This compositional gradient has geological
 parallels. Io is extremely geologically active, Europa
 seems to be active on a more modest scale, and
 Ganymede has undergone bouts of activity in its
 geological past. Only Callisto reveals no geological
 activity. In similar fashion, Callisto’s surface is very
 heavily cratered from the impact of comets and
 asteroids; Ganymede, like Earth’s moon, is heavily
 cratered in parts; Europa is very lightly cratered; and
 no craters have been detected on Io, even though
 Jupiter’s gravity attracts comets and asteroids
 passing near it, substantially increasing the
 bombardment rate of the inner moons compared to
 that of the outer ones. But because of Io’s high
 degree of geological activity, its surface undergoes
 more-or-less continuous volcanic resurfacing."

(A) indicate why the absence of craters on Io’s surface is surprising

(D) contrast Jupiter’s characteristics with the characteristics of its four largest moons
(E) illustrate the similarity between Jupiter’s four largest moons and the planets of the solar system",A,"Evaluation

The reference to Jupiter’s gravity is part of the author’s discussion of cratering on Jupiter’s moons; Jupiter’s gravity is strong enough to attract comets and asteroids that then bombard its inner moons. A high bombardment rate would seem to indicate that a great deal of cratering would occur on those inner moons, and yet the passage reports that, unexpectedly, on the innermost moon, Io, no craters have been detected.

A Correct. Jupiter’s gravity attracts comets and asteroids, which increases the bombardment rate of its inner moons, including Io. This bombardment makes it surprising that Io’s surface shows no cratering.
B The passage discusses the likely effect of Jupiter’s gravity on its inner moons but not its outer moons; two of the large moons the passage discusses are outer moons.
C According to the passage, Callisto, an outer moon, lacks geological activity because of its distance from Jupiter; Jupiter’s gravity is not offered as a contributing factor to this inactivity.
D The passage does not contrast Jupiter with its moons; rather, it compares the moons to one another.
E The first paragraph of the passage suggests that Jupiter’s moons vary in a way similar to that of the planets of the solar system, but the author does not refer to Jupiter’s gravity to illustrate the similarity in this variation.

The correct answer is A.","Io and Europa, the inner two of Jupiter’s four

RCQ14,RCP5,"According to the passage, which of the following contributed to Marcus Garvey’s success?
(A) He introduced cultural and historical consciousness to the African American community.
(B) He believed enthusiastically in the traditional American success ethos.
(C) His audience had already formed a consciousness that made it receptive to his message.
(D) His message appealed to critics of African American support for United States military involvement in the First World War.
(E) He supported the movement to protest segregation that had emerged prior to his arrival in the United States.",C,"Supporting idea

To answer this question, find what the passage states explicitly about how Marcus Garvey achieved his success. The passage begins by stating that Garvey arrived at the right time: that returning African American soldiers were primed to receive what he had to say about the African American community. These soldiers already held strong beliefs about their rights to opportunities for success; the passage concludes that the divide between the soldiers’ expectations and their experiences led to Garvey’s success.

A The passage states that African American people were in possession of a strong cultural and historical consciousness prior to Garvey’s arrival in the United States.
B The passage attributes belief in the traditional American success ethos to African American people who joined the armed forces; it does not mention Garvey’s beliefs on this subject.
C Correct. African American soldiers who had experienced segregation during the First World War were ready to hear what Garvey had to say.
D Critics of African American support for United States involvement in the First World War are not mentioned in the passage.
E While Garvey most likely would have supported a movement to protest segregation, such a movement is not discussed in the passage.

The correct answer is C.","When Jamaican-born social activist Marcus
 Garvey came to the United States in 1916, he
 arrived at precisely the right historical moment.
 What made the moment right was the return of
 African American soldiers from the First World War
 in 1918, which created an ideal constituency for
 someone with Garvey’s message of unity, pride,
 and improved conditions for African American
 communities.
 Hoping to participate in the traditional American
 ethos of individual success, many African American
 people entered the armed forces with enthusiasm,
 only to find themselves segregated from white
 troops and subjected to numerous indignities. They
 returned to a United States that was as segregated
 as it had been before the war. Considering similar
 experiences, anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace

(D) They became aware of the gap between their expectations and the realities of American culture.
(E) They repudiated Garvey’s message of pride and unity.",D,"Inference

According to the passage, African Americans enthusiastically joined the armed services but were confronted with continued segregation, both in the military and when they returned home. The passage does not explicitly state their response to these experiences, but a response can be inferred. The second paragraph, refers to anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace, who argued that a revitalization movement may be brought about by the perception of a gap between expectations and reality, and such a revitalization did occur in African American communities following the First World War; thus, many African American people may have become aware of a gap such as Wallace described.

A The passage states that African American troops experienced segregation and other indignities while in the military; these experiences could reasonably be inferred to have dampened their enthusiasm for the armed forces. Regardless, the passage does not suggest an enthusiastic allegiance.
B The passage describes African American people’s enthusiasm about joining the military. Although they experienced segregation and other indignities while in the military, the passage does not suggest that their opinion about involvement in the war changed.
C While African American troops may have joined political organizations, the passage does not provide any actual evidence of this having occurred.
D Correct. The fact that, as the passage states, a revitalization movement occurred in the African American community following the First World War suggests that the returning soldiers did become aware of the gap between their expectations of an improved situation with regard to segregation and the reality of continued segregation in the United States.
E The passage does not suggest that African American troops repudiated Garvey’s message. On the contrary, it states that Garvey built the largest revitalization movement in African American history . This suggests that the members of the African American community, including the returning soldiers, were extremely receptive to Garvey’s message.

(E) The goal of the mass movement that Marcus Garvey helped bring into being was to build on the pride and unity among African Americans.",B,"Inference

To determine what it is logical to infer regarding the scholars discussed in the third paragraph, look at the context in which they are mentioned. According to the passage, these scholars argue that Garvey was responsible for creating a particular consciousness within the African American community, a consciousness that the passage identifies as
identity, strength, and
[a]
sense of history.
Unlike the passage author, these scholars believe strongly in Garvey’s responsibility for this consciousness, so they would most likely reject any suggestion that it existed prior to his arrival and activism.

A According to the passage, the scholars believe that Garvey was responsible for the creation of the consciousness that led to revitalization, which suggests that revitalization resulted from Garvey’s activism, not soldiers’ activism.
B Correct. According to the passage, the scholars believe that Garvey created the consciousness that led to his revitalization movement. This suggests that he had to change prevailing attitudes in order to foster this new consciousness.
C According to the passage, the scholars believe that Garvey created a new consciousness in the African American community; thus, the prevailing sensibility could not have provided a foundation for his appeal.
D According to the passage, the scholars believe that Garvey built his revitalization movement on a new consciousness of cultural and historical identity, not a previously existing one.
E According to the passage, the scholars’ position is that Garvey’s movement was built on a new sense of pride and unity that he provided, and that that sense did not precede Garvey’s work.

This question depends on identifying what the passage states directly about African American people’s reasons for joining the armed forces. The reason offered by the passage is that the African American people who entered the armed forces did so because they were

A Although this is a plausible reason for entering the armed forces, the passage does not discuss economic conditions.
B Correct. The passage states that African American people who joined the armed forces during the First World War wanted to achieve individual success.

(E) Different species of organisms living in the same environment will seldom adapt to features of that environment in the same way.",B,"Application

This question requires recognizing a principle underlying the passage’s overall discussion. The passage makes a general claim about terrestrial animals’ need to overcome the effect of gravity on their blood circulation systems, and it then uses the specific example of terrestrial snakes to illustrate this claim. To help identify the adaptations used by terrestrial snakes, the passage describes what happens to sea snakes, which are aquatic and less affected by gravity’s influence, when they are subjected to a terrestrial environment. The specific problems faced by these snakes strongly suggest that terrestrial snakes have developed ways to overcome these problems. The passage then identifies specific physiological differences between sea snakes and terrestrial snakes that demonstrate how terrestrial snakes overcome gravity’s influence.

A The passage discusses how species have successfully adapted to their specific environments and does not mention that these adaptations create disadvantages in that environment.
B Correct. The passage discusses the problems faced by sea snakes when they are subjected to a terrestrial environment and then examines terrestrial snakes to illustrate how certain adaptations solved these problems.
C The passage is not concerned with evaluating the effectiveness of species’ adaptations to their environments; it takes for granted that these adaptations are effective.
D The passage is concerned with how species adapt differently to different environments and not with how adaptations to different environments are similar.
E The passage discusses how different environments affect how species have adapted, not how different species adapt to a similar environment.

The correct answer is B.","In terrestrial environments, gravity places
 special demands on the cardiovascular systems of
 animals. Gravitational pressure can cause blood to
 pool in the lower regions of the body, making it
 difficult to circulate blood to critical organs such as
 the brain. Terrestrial snakes, in particular, exhibit
 adaptations that aid in circulating blood against the
 force of gravity.
 The problem confronting terrestrial snakes is best
 illustrated by what happens to sea snakes when
 removed from their supportive medium. Because the
 vertical pressure gradients within the blood vessels
 are counteracted by similar pressure gradients in the
 surrounding water, the distribution of blood
 throughout the body of sea snakes remains about
 the same regardless of their orientation in space,
 provided they remain in the ocean. When removed
 from the water and tilted at various angles with the
 head up, however, blood pressure at their midpoint
 drops significantly, and at brain level falls to zero.
 That many terrestrial snakes in similar spatial
 orientations do not experience this kind of circulatory
 failure suggests that certain adaptations enable them
 to regulate blood pressure more effectively in those
 orientations.
 One such adaptation is the closer proximity of the
 terrestrial snake’s heart to its head, which helps to
 ensure circulation to the brain, regardless of the
 snake’s orientation in space. The heart of sea snakes
 can be located near the middle of the body, a
 position that minimizes the work entailed in
 circulating blood to both extremities. In arboreal
 snakes, however, which dwell in trees and often
 assume a vertical posture, the average distance
 from the heart to the head can be as little as
 15 percent of overall body length. Such a location
 requires that blood circulated to the tail of the
 snake travel a greater distance back to the heart,
 a problem solved by another adaptation. When
 climbing, arboreal snakes often pause
 momentarily to wiggle their bodies, causing waves
 of muscle contraction that advance from the lower
 torso to the head. By compressing the veins and
 forcing blood forward, these contractions
 apparently improve the flow of venous blood
 returning to the heart."
RCQ19,RCP6,"According to the passage, one reason that the distribution of blood in the sea snake changes little while the creature remains in the ocean is that

(C) the sea snake assumes a vertical posture less frequently than do the terrestrial and the arboreal snake
(D) the sea snake often relies on waves of muscle contractions to help move blood from the torso to the head
(E) the force of pressure gradients in the water surrounding the sea snake exceeds that of vertical pressure gradients within its circulatory system",B,"Supporting ideas

This question asks for an identification of factual information in the passage. Given that the contrast between sea snakes and terrestrial snakes is being used to identify adaptations used by terrestrial animals to overcome the effect of gravity on their circulation systems, the passage needs initially to illustrate why it is that sea snakes are not confronted with the same problems that gravity causes for terrestrial snakes. This information therefore needs to come fairly early in the passage.

A The passage identifies the location of a sea snake’s heart as a factor that minimizes the effort required to pump blood to both extremities but not as a cause of the even distribution of blood in sea snakes.
B Correct. The passage states explicitly in lines 11–17 that while sea snakes are in the ocean, the vertical pressure gradients in their blood vessels are counteracted by the pressure gradients in the water.
C The passage does not discuss the frequency with which any snakes assume certain postures.
D The passage discusses muscle contractions only in relation to arboreal snakes.
E The passage states that the vertical pressures within sea snakes’ blood vessels are counteracted (line 13) by the water’s pressure, which suggests that the pressures are equalized, not that one force exceeds the other.

RCQ20,RCP6,"It can be inferred from the passage that which of the following is true of species of terrestrial snakes that often need to assume a vertical posture?

(C) They cannot counteract the pooling of blood in lower regions of their bodies as effectively as sea snakes can.
(D) The blood pressure at their midpoint decreases significantly when they are tilted with their heads up.
(E) They are unable to rely on muscle contractions to move venous blood from the lower torso to the head.",B,"Inference

This question requires using information given about how arboreal snakes, which are frequently in vertical postures, have adapted to gravity’s influence to make an assumption that other terrestrial snakes that are frequently in these postures are likely to have similar adaptations. The passage implies that sea snakes have hearts at the midpoint of their bodies because the water’s pressure gradients help distribute blood evenly. It then illustrates that arboreal snakes have hearts closer to their heads to help keep blood flowing to their brain when they are in vertical postures.

A The passage does not suggest that any of the snakes mentioned are ill-adapted to their particular environments.
B Correct. The passage states that arboreal snakes have hearts close to their heads and not at the midpoints of their bodies, so it is reasonable to conclude that any terrestrial snake that frequently assumes vertical postures would be unlikely to have hearts at their bodies’ midpoint.
C As with answer choice (A), the passage does not suggest that any species of snake is ill-adapted to its environment.
D The passage states that sea snakes lose pressure at their midpoints when they are tilted on land with heads up but that terrestrial snakes do not have this problem.
E Because arboreal snakes use muscle contractions to circulate blood when they are vertical, it is likely that most terrestrial snakes that frequently assume vertical postures also have this capability.

Answering this question requires understanding why sea snakes have been brought into the passage’s overall discussion about how terrestrial animals have overcome the influence of gravity on their blood circulation. The passage uses the effects that gravity has on sea snakes when they are taken out of water to identify problems that terrestrial snakes must have adapted to in order to survive.

A Correct. The passage uses the problems sea snakes have when taken out of water to illustrate that without certain adaptations, terrestrial snakes would likely have similar problems.
B The passage discusses sea snakes to illustrate problems faced by terrestrial snakes, not to explain how terrestrial snakes have adapted to gravity’s influence.
C The passage does not discuss the effects of circulatory failure on arboreal snakes.
D The passage does not compare or contrast the effectiveness of the various adaptations used by different snakes.

 from the heart to the head can be as little as

 requires that blood circulated to the tail of the

RCQ22,RCP6,"It can be inferred from the passage that which of the following is a true statement about sea snakes?
(A) They frequently rely on waves of muscle contractions from the lower torso to the head to supplement the work of the heart.
(B) They cannot effectively regulate their blood pressure when placed in seawater and tilted at an angle with the head pointed downward.
(C) They are more likely to have a heart located in close proximity to their heads than are arboreal snakes.
(D) They become acutely vulnerable to the effects of gravitational pressure on their circulatory system when they are placed in a terrestrial environment.
(E) Their cardiovascular system is not as complicated as that of arboreal snakes.",D,"Inference

Answering this question requires understanding why sea snakes are discussed in the passage and what happens to them when they are taken out of water and subjected to the force of gravity. The second paragraph implies strongly that sea snakes will not survive certain terrestrial situations for which they are not adapted.

A The passage associates muscle contractions to circulate blood with arboreal snakes only.
B According to the passage, sea snakes’ inability to regulate blood pressure occurs only when they are taken out of water.
C The passage states clearly that arboreal snakes have hearts closer to their heads than do sea snakes.
D Correct. The passage states that in certain postures, sea snakes placed in a terrestrial environment will lose all blood pressure at their brains, which is an acute vulnerability.
E The passage does not provide the information needed to compare the complexity of the various snakes discussed.

The correct answer is D.","In terrestrial environments, gravity places
 special demands on the cardiovascular systems of
 animals. Gravitational pressure can cause blood to
 pool in the lower regions of the body, making it
 difficult to circulate blood to critical organs such as
 the brain. Terrestrial snakes, in particular, exhibit
 adaptations that aid in circulating blood against the
 force of gravity.
 The problem confronting terrestrial snakes is best
 illustrated by what happens to sea snakes when
 removed from their supportive medium. Because the
 vertical pressure gradients within the blood vessels
 are counteracted by similar pressure gradients in the
 surrounding water, the distribution of blood
 throughout the body of sea snakes remains about
 the same regardless of their orientation in space,
 provided they remain in the ocean. When removed
 from the water and tilted at various angles with the
 head up, however, blood pressure at their midpoint
 drops significantly, and at brain level falls to zero.
 That many terrestrial snakes in similar spatial
 orientations do not experience this kind of circulatory
 failure suggests that certain adaptations enable them
 to regulate blood pressure more effectively in those
 orientations.
 One such adaptation is the closer proximity of the
 terrestrial snake’s heart to its head, which helps to
 ensure circulation to the brain, regardless of the
 snake’s orientation in space. The heart of sea snakes
 can be located near the middle of the body, a
 position that minimizes the work entailed in
 circulating blood to both extremities. In arboreal
 snakes, however, which dwell in trees and often
 assume a vertical posture, the average distance
 from the heart to the head can be as little as
 15 percent of overall body length. Such a location

RCQ23,RCP6,"The author suggests that which of the following is a disadvantage that results from the location of a snake’s heart in close proximity to its head?
(A) A decrease in the efficiency with which the snake regulates the flow of blood to the brain
(B) A decrease in the number of orientations in space that a snake can assume without loss of blood flow to the brain
(C) A decrease in blood pressure at the snake’s midpoint when it is tilted at various angles with its head up
(D) An increase in the tendency of blood to pool at the snake’s head when the snake is tilted at various angles with its head down
(E) An increase in the amount of effort required to distribute blood to and from the snake’s tail",E,"Inference

This question asks for an inference about the location of a snake’s heart being closer to the brain than to the midpoint of its body. In the third paragraph, the passage states that in terrestrial snakes, which must fight the influence of gravity, the closer proximity of the heart to the head ensures blood circulation to the brain. The passage notes, however, that this makes it more difficult for such snakes to maintain blood circulation to the tail.

A The passage states that snakes have brains closer to their heads to more efficiently circulate blood to the brain.
B The passage suggests that having the heart close to the head increases the spatial orientations a snake can assume without losing blood flow to the brain, rather than decreases the number of orientations.
C The passage indicates that this is true only of sea snakes with hearts near their body’s midpoint.
D The passage mentions blood pooling in the lower portions of a terrestrial organism’s body but does not imply that blood can pool at a snake’s head.
E Correct. Because, as the passage states, it is more difficult for a snake with its heart close to its head to circulate blood to the tail, and therefore its body is likely to put more effort into circulating blood to the tail.

The correct answer is E.","In terrestrial environments, gravity places

(D) discuss two specific examples of phenomena mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph
(E) introduce evidence that undermines a view reported earlier in the passage",D,"Evaluation

Answering this question requires recognizing how the passage develops its main point. The first paragraph sets up a general claim about gravity’s influence on terrestrial organisms. The second paragraph then describes the ill effects that gravity has on sea snakes to identify problems that terrestrial snakes have had to adapt to. The third paragraph then uses examples to illustrate how terrestrial snakes have adapted to gravity’s influence.

A The topic of the third paragraph is the adaptations developed by terrestrial snakes to survive gravity’s influence, which is part of the discussion in both the first and second paragraphs.
B There is no comparison in the passage of the efficiency of the different methods used by snakes to adapt to gravity’s influence.
C The third paragraph is concerned with illustrating certain adaptations used by snakes and offers no conclusions about the problems terrestrial snakes have had to adapt to, which is the topic of the second paragraph.
D Correct. The end of the second paragraph refers to certain adaptations (line 23) that the third paragraph then goes on to identify and discuss.
E The third paragraph supports the main idea of the passage and is not used to counter any claim made earlier.

Answering this question involves assessing what the passage as a whole is attempting to do. While the passage begins by making a general claim about gravity’s influence on the cardiovascular systems of terrestrial animals, it immediately points to terrestrial snakes as a good example supporting this claim. The rest of the passage is then devoted to illustrating, using the observations involving sea snakes, how gravity’s influence has shaped the cardiovascular systems of terrestrial snakes.

A Correct. The entire passage is devoted to an explanation of how terrestrial snakes have adapted to gravity’s influence.
B While the passage does compare the systems of the two snakes, it does so for the larger purpose of demonstrating gravity’s influence on terrestrial snakes.
C The passage is more concerned with how the systems of the two snakes are different, rather than why , in order to identify how terrestrial snakes have adapted to gravity’s influence.
D There is no judgment in the passage as to the superiority of one snake’s system over the other.
E While the passage does explain how sea snakes do this, it does so only for the larger purpose of identifying how terrestrial snakes have adapted to gravity’s influence.

(D) comparing the advantages of several definitions
(E) clarifying some ambiguous definitions",C,"Main idea

The author’s primary concern is found by considering the passage as a whole. In the first paragraph, the author raises the central question regarding the meaning of
services
and then examines two definitions. The second paragraph analyzes the United States government’s definition of
services
in more detail. The author is primarily interested in exploring different definitions of
services
.

A No research data are presented.
B The author points out the weakness of several definitions rather than giving reasons to adopt a particular one.
C Correct. The author considers several definitions of services .
D The author largely analyzes the disadvantages of the definitions.
E The author points out problems in the definitions rather than providing clarifications of the definitions themselves.

The correct answer is C.","In 1988 services moved ahead of
 manufacturing as the main product of the United
 States economy. But what is meant by “services”?
 Some economists define a service as something
 that is produced and consumed simultaneously, for
 example, a haircut. The broader, classical definition
 is that a service is an intangible something that
 cannot be touched or stored. Yet electric utilities
 can store energy, and computer programmers
 save information electronically. Thus, the classical
 definition is hard to sustain.
 The United States government’s definition is
 more practical: services are the residual category
 that includes everything that is not agriculture or
 industry. Under this definition, services includes
 activities as diverse as engineering and driving a
 bus. However, besides lacking a strong conceptual
 framework, this definition fails to recognize the
 distinction between service industries and service
 occupations. It categorizes workers based on their
 company’s final product rather than on the actual
 work the employees perform. Thus, the many
 service workers employed by manufacturers—
 bookkeepers or janitors, for example—would
 fall under the industrial rather than the services
 category. Such ambiguities reveal the arbitrariness
 of this definition and suggest that, although
 practical for government purposes, it does not
 accurately reflect the composition of the current

This question asks the reader to find information that is suggested but not directly stated in the passage. The author discusses the classical definition at the end of the first paragraph, pointing out two examples in which it does not apply and concluding that this definition is
hard to sustain
. By comparison, the government’s definition is
more practical
because it is easy to apply; everything that is not agriculture or industry is defined as a service. An examination of the analysis of both definitions reveals that, according to the author, the classical definition is harder to apply.

A The author describes the United States government’s definition as more practical or pragmatic.
B Correct. Citing two cases in which the classical definition does not apply, the author implies that this definition is harder to apply than the government’s.
C Although the United States government’s definition is said to lead to ambiguities , the examples given to suggest difficulties with the classical definition indicate that it may be at least as ambiguous.
D The author does not say that the classical definition is more widely used.

(E) Most service workers are employed in occupations where they provide services that do not fall under the classical definition of services.",A,"Inference

The question’s use of the word
suggests
means that the answer depends on making an inference. According to the author, one of the failures of the government’s definition of services is that
the many service workers employed by manufacturers—bookkeepers or janitors, for example—would fall under the industrial rather than the services category
(lines 22–26). This example shows that the number of service workers is likely to be underestimated.

A Correct. Because some service workers are included in the industrial category, it is possible that the total number of service workers may be underestimated.
B The passage does not provide the information to support this statement.
C The author says that services moved ahead of manufacturing as the main product in 1988 but does not discuss the number of workers in either area.

This question is based on specific information explicitly stated in the passage. According to the author, the government’s definition fails because
it categorizes workers based on their company’s final product rather than on the actual work the employees perform
(lines 20–22).

A The author calls this definition practical for government purposes , so for the government it is more useful than other definitions.
B The definition includes everything that is not agriculture or industry , while the classical definition does not include occupations that are clearly services; the government’s definition is thus not narrower.
C Correct. Workers are categorized by the final product of their company rather than by the type of work they perform at that company.
D Diversity of occupations within the service industries is not discussed.

The author discusses
the many service workers employed by manufacturers
to illustrate the failure of the government’s definition to distinguish between service industries and service occupations. The resulting ambiguities, in the author’s view, reveal the

This question asks for an abstract view of what the passage as a whole is primarily doing. The passage introduces a particular methodology that scholars of women’s history have been encouraged to employ, explaining why the use of the methodology is supported. The passage then goes on to raise some concerns about the use of the methodology and cites one example in which caution is needed.

A The passage is primarily concerned with only one methodology.
B The passage mentions why the methodology had been encouraged but does not give the history of its origins; while it cautions historians to employ the methodology carefully, it is not concerned with drawbacks of its proper use.

Answering this question involves recognizing what the author believes about oral narratives and then applying this belief to a hypothetical situation in which the author makes recommendations to scholars of women’s history. While acknowledging the appeal of oral narratives to these scholars, in the second paragraph the author urges caution when using these narratives as sources of
disinterested commentary
(line 16). The passage then states that people’s oral narratives are shaped by
cultural and historical factors
(line 20), which presumably relate to the cultural and historical context within which the narratives are spoken.

A The passage does not mention the personal life experiences of scholars.
B The passage does not mention the intended audiences of oral narratives.
C The passage mentions standard histories (line 7) only as a reference to scholarly works that often have shortcomings.
D Correct. The passage cautions that oral narratives may be biased due to cultural and historical factors, and it is therefore reasonable to suppose that the author would recommend that scholars consider this when using such information.
E The passage does not refer to oral narratives as being valuable only for filling a gap in the available historical record.

The correct answer is D.","Current feminist theory, in validating women’s own
 stories of their experience, has encouraged scholars

political rhetoric

RCQ37,RCP9,"The passage suggests that in order for a manufacturer in a capital-intensive industry to have a decisive advantage over competitors making similar products, the manufacturer must
(A) be the first in the industry to build production facilities of theoretically optimal size
(B) make every effort to keep fixed and sunk costs as low as possible
(C) be one of the first to operate its manufacturing plants at minimum efficient scale
(D) produce goods of higher quality than those produced by direct competitors
(E) stockpile raw materials at production sites in order to ensure a steady flow of such materials",C,"Inference

This question asks for an inference about what a manufacturer in a capital-intensive industry must do to have an advantage over competitors making similar products. The passage addresses this question by stating that advantage accrues to those firms that are the first to exploit the full potential of optimally sized, technologically sophisticated plants. In this context, exploiting the full potential of such plants means operating them at
minimum efficient scale
. Based on the definition in the first paragraph, this means that the plant must have an output of such a size that the cost per unit of output is at a minimum.

A The passage says that for new capital-intensive firms to dominate the market, it is not enough for them to have optimally sized plants; the plants must also be operated in a way that fully exploits their potential.
B While keeping fixed and sunk costs low would obviously help keep overall costs low, the passage does not suggest that this is decisive in enabling a firm to have an advantage over competitors.
C Correct. Being among the first manufacturers to operate plants at minimum efficient scale means that those plants are being exploited to their full potential. This strategy would most likely give such manufacturers a decisive advantage over new firms hoping to compete effectively.
D The passage does not discuss the quality of goods made by manufacturers.
E The passage does not suggest that stockpiling raw materials is the most efficient way to ensure a steady flow of raw materials into the manufacturing process, though the passage states that such a steady flow is a factor in achieving minimum efficient scale.

The correct answer is C.","Manufacturers have to do more than build large
 manufacturing plants to realize economies of scale.
 It is true that as the capacity of a manufacturing
 operation rises, costs per unit of output fall as plant
 size approaches “minimum efficient scale,” where the
 cost per unit of output reaches a minimum,
 determined roughly by the state of existing technology
 and size of the potential market. However, minimum
 efficient scale cannot be fully realized unless a steady
 “throughput” (the flow of materials through a plant) is
 attained. The throughput needed to maintain the
 optimal scale of production requires careful
 coordination not only of the flow of goods through the
 production process, but also of the flow of input from
 suppliers and the flow of output to wholesalers and
 final consumers. If throughput falls below a critical
 point, unit costs rise sharply and profits disappear. A
 manufacturer’s fixed costs and “sunk costs” (original
 capital investment in the physical plant) do not
 decrease when production declines due to inadequate
 supplies of raw materials, problems on the factory
 floor, or inefficient sales networks. Consequently,
 potential economies of scale are based on the
 physical and engineering characteristics of the
 production facilities—that is, on tangible capital—but
 realized economies of scale are operational and
 organizational, and depend on knowledge, skills,
 experience, and teamwork—that is, on organized
 human capabilities, or intangible capital.
 The importance of investing in intangible capital
 becomes obvious when one looks at what happens in
 new capital-intensive manufacturing industries. Such
 industries are quickly dominated, not by the first firms
 to acquire technologically sophisticated plants of
 theoretically optimal size, but rather by the first to
 exploit the full potential of such plants. Once some
 firms achieve this, a market becomes extremely hard
 to enter. Challengers must construct comparable
 plants and do so after the first movers have already
 worked out problems with suppliers or with new
 production processes. Challengers must create
 distribution networks and marketing systems in
 markets where first movers have all the contacts and
 know-how. And challengers must recruit management
 teams to compete with those that have already
 mastered these functional and strategic activities."
RCQ38,RCP9,"The passage suggests that which of the following is true of a manufacturer’s fixed and sunk costs?
(A) The extent to which they are determined by market conditions for the goods being manufactured is frequently underestimated.
(B) If they are kept as low as possible, the manufacturer is very likely to realize significant profits.
(C) They are the primary factor that determines whether a manufacturer will realize economies of scale.
(D) They should be on a par with the fixed and sunk costs of the manufacturer’s competitors.
(E) They are not affected by fluctuations in a manufacturing plant’s throughput.",E,"Inference

This question asks about what the passage implies about fixed and sunk costs. The passage states that when production declines due to certain factors, such costs remain at the same level (which may be high), and the cost per unit produced (
unit costs
) rises sharply.

A The passage discusses the impact of market conditions on determining what the optimal size of a manufacturing plant is (which affects fixed and sunk costs). But it makes no claim about the frequency with which such an impact is “underestimated.”
B The passage emphasizes that failing to keep throughput at an efficiently high level reduces profitability because that failure results in increased cost per unit (to which, of course, the plant’s fixed and sunk costs contribute). But the passage does not claim that keeping aggregate fixed and sunk costs very low is necessary in order to have the most competitive production operation.
C The passage emphasizes that the crucial factor in achieving economies of scale is efficient operation of the production facilities, not the size of the firm’s fixed and sunk costs (even though such costs are clearly in part determined by the size and design of the production facilities).
D While a manufacturer’s fixed and sunk costs may be on a par with those of the manufacturer’s competitors, the passage provides no grounds for inferring that there is any need for them to be (for example, physical plants that employ different technologies may have different price tags).
E Correct. According to the passage, “throughput” refers to the flow of materials through a plant. This flow can vary as a result of various factors, but fixed and sunk costs—financial resources already committed—remain the same regardless of such variation.

The correct answer is E.","Manufacturers have to do more than build large

(E) demonstrate the potential dangers of a commonly used strategy",A,"Evaluation

This question asks about the rhetorical function of the second paragraph. While the first paragraph argues that a crucial factor in achieving economies of scale is intangible capital, or organized human capabilities, the second paragraph uses the example of new capital-intensive manufacturing industries to help show that this is indeed the case.

A Correct. The second paragraph provides an example that illustrates the claims made in the first paragraph. It discusses the way in which intangible capital—e.g., distribution networks, marketing systems, smooth production processes, and qualified management teams—enables manufacturers in new capital-intensive manufacturing industries to realize economies of scale and achieve market dominance.
B The second paragraph does, in a sense, “evaluate” investment in intangible capital: it suggests that such investment is necessary. However, investment in intangible capital is the only strategy it discusses.
C The second paragraph supports rather than undermines the first paragraph’s argument.
D Nothing in the second paragraph suggests that there are, or could be, any objections to the first paragraph’s argument.
E The second paragraph discusses the potential positive outcomes of investing in intangible capital. It suggests that there might be negative consequences to not making such investments, but it does not indicate that avoiding such investments is a commonly used strategy.

The correct answer is A.","Manufacturers have to do more than build large

RCQ40,RCP9,"The passage LEAST supports the inference that a manufacturer’s throughput could be adversely affected by
(A) a mistake in judgment regarding the selection of a wholesaler
(B) a breakdown in the factory’s machinery
(C) a labor dispute on the factory floor
(D) an increase in the cost per unit of output
(E) a drop in the efficiency of the sales network",D,"Application

This question may be best approached by using an elimination strategy—first finding the four choices that can reasonably be inferred from the passage, and then checking to make sure that the remaining choice cannot reasonably be inferred. This requires understanding the information the passage gives about throughput, then making inferences about what can cause throughput to drop. The passage defines throughput generally as
the flow of materials through a plant
and goes on to explain that it involves coordination of the production process itself, as well as obtaining materials from suppliers and marketing and distributing the manufactured products. Anything that damages this flow of materials and products would be said to have an adverse effect on throughput.

A Making a poor judgment about a wholesaler would most likely have an adverse effect on throughput, in that it could affect the flow of output to wholesalers and final consumers .
B A breakdown in machinery would likely fall into the category of problems on the factory floor mentioned in the passage and would likely prove damaging to throughput because of its effect on the production process itself.
C A labor dispute would also likely fall into the category of problems on the factory floor mentioned in the passage and would probably cause a decline in production and thus adversely affect throughput.
D Correct. The passage emphasizes that changes in throughput can cause increases or decreases in costs per unit. But the passage is not committed to any claims about how changes in costs per unit might affect throughput.
E The passage suggests that inefficient sales networks could cause a decline in production. Thus a decrease in sales efficiency would most likely adversely affect a manufacturer’s ability to provide goods to consumers, and thus would create problems with throughput.

The correct answer is D.","Manufacturers have to do more than build large

This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole. In general, it makes an argument for investing in intangible capital as a way for manufacturers to realize economies of scale, and it supports its argument with an example.

A Correct. The passage focuses on intangible capital as a crucial factor in realizing economies of scale.
B According to the passage, manufacturers gain competitive advantage by building plants of optimal size that they then fully exploit; nothing in the passage suggests that large plants are frequently optimal.

D The passage states that new capital-intensive manufacturing industries are dominated not by firms that are the first to build large plants, but by firms that exploit the full potential of their plants.
E The passage indicates that economies of scale can be achieved in plants of optimal size. The passage does not suggest that large plants cannot be optimal.

(D) describe the fluctuating patterns of population cycles in lepidoptera
(E) question the idea that a single driving force is behind population cycles in lepidoptera",C,"Main idea

This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole in order to identify its purpose. The first paragraph defines population cycles of lepidoptera and discusses some ways those cycles have been studied. It suggests that a particular agent may regulate these cycles. The second paragraph describes a candidate for this agent: nuclear polyhedrosis viruses. The third paragraph explains why this hypothesis is compelling.

A The passage mentions new techniques in molecular biology, but it does so in order to explain why a particular candidate for the agent behind population cycles has come to light.
B The theory the passage presents is that there is a driving force behind lepidoptera population cycles. It does not refute this theory; rather, it offers a convincing case for nuclear polyhedrosis viruses as that force. It also discusses some previous approaches to seeking plausible hypotheses but does not focus on refuting any particular hypothesis.
C Correct. The passage is primarily concerned with presenting the hypothesis that nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are the driving force behind lepidoptera population cycles.
D The first paragraph describes the fluctuating patterns of lepidoptera population cycles, but it does so to explain what population cycles are, so that it can then go on to attempt to account for those cycles.
E The passage is concerned with making a case for nuclear polyhedrosis viruses as the driving force behind at least some lepidoptera population cycles, not with questioning the idea that there is a driving force.

The correct answer is C.","A small number of the forest species of
 lepidoptera (moths and butterflies, which exist as
 caterpillars during most of their life cycle) exhibit
 regularly recurring patterns of population growth
 and decline—such fluctuations in population are
 known as population cycles. Although many different
 variables influence population levels, a regular
 pattern such as a population cycle seems to imply a
 dominant, driving force. Identification of that driving
 force, however, has proved surprisingly elusive
 despite considerable research. The common
 approach of studying causes of population cycles by
 measuring the mortality caused by different agents,
 such as predatory birds or parasites, has been
 unproductive in the case of lepidoptera. Moreover,
 population ecologists’ attempts to alter cycles by
 changing the caterpillars’ habitat and by reducing
 caterpillar populations have not succeeded. In short,
 the evidence implies that these insect populations, if
 not self-regulating, may at least be regulated by an
 agent more intimately connected with the insect
 than are predatory birds or parasites.

(D) provide evidence that lepidoptera populations are self-regulating
(E) determine the life stages of lepidoptera at which mortality rates are highest",A,"Inference

The passage states that mortality caused by various agents, birds and parasites among them, was measured because this was the common approach to studying causes of population cycles. This in turn suggests that those scientists engaged in such measuring in the case of lepidoptera were attempting to come up with a definitive explanation for why those lepidoptera population cycles occurred.

A Correct. Measuring mortality caused by various agents was part of the attempt to determine the driving force behind lepidoptera population cycles.
B The passage does not indicate that behavioral factors in lepidoptera are related to their mortality as caused by agents such as predatory birds or parasites.
C The passage is concerned not with controlling lepidoptera population growth, but rather with determining why population cycles occur.
D According to the information in the passage, scientists sought to measure mortality caused by particular agents in order to determine the driving force behind lepidoptera population cycles. In suggesting that mortality caused by these agents is not that force, the measurements may have indicated that the cycles could be self-regulating, but they were not undertaken in order to provide such evidence.
E The passage discusses mortality primarily in the caterpillar stage and does not suggest that any research was directed toward comparing caterpillar mortality rates with mortality rates in other life stages of the insects.

The correct answer is A.","A small number of the forest species of
 lepidoptera (moths and butterflies, which exist as
 caterpillars during most of their life cycle) exhibit
 regularly recurring patterns of population growth

 pattern such as a population cycle seems to imply a
 dominant, driving force. Identification of that driving
 force, however, has proved surprisingly elusive
 despite considerable research. The common
 approach of studying causes of population cycles by
 measuring the mortality caused by different agents,
 such as predatory birds or parasites, has been
 unproductive in the case of lepidoptera. Moreover,
 population ecologists’ attempts to alter cycles by
 changing the caterpillars’ habitat and by reducing
 caterpillar populations have not succeeded. In short,

(C) Recent experiments have revealed that the nuclear polyhedrosis virus is present in a number of predators and parasites of lepidoptera.
(D) Differences among the habitats of lepidoptera species make it difficult to assess the effects of weather on lepidoptera population cycles.
(E) Viral disease is typically observed in a large proportion of the lepidoptera population.",B,"Evaluation

The sentence in question presents the author’s conclusion that lepidoptera populations may be self-regulating or regulated by something more closely connected to the insects than predatory birds or parasites are. To weaken that conclusion requires weakening its support, namely, that mortality caused by predators and parasites seems not to affect population cycles, and that changing habitats and reducing populations has not altered population cycles either.

A A drop in birds and parasites preying on lepidoptera would not weaken the author’s conclusion; mortality caused by these predators has not affected population cycles.
B Correct. New experiments involving changes in habitat that did succeed in altering population cycles would suggest that the populations are not in fact self-regulating, and that the search for another cycle-altering agent may be unnecessary.
C This finding would support the idea that the nuclear polyhedrosis virus is responsible for population cycles—that is, that the virus is the closely connected agent the author concludes is responsible.
D The suggestion that the effects of weather may not have been adequately assessed is remotely relevant to the author’s conclusion, but the mere difficulty of assessing the effects provides no positive reason to suppose that weather may be the cause of the cycles. On the other hand, answer choice B does offer evidence for an alternative explanation.
E Viral disease is what the author ultimately suggests is the agent that drives the lepidoptera population cycles in question. The wide presence of viruses in lepidoptera could help support the author’s conclusion.

This question addresses what the passage states directly about population ecologists’ beliefs regarding viral diseases prior to the discovery of new viral DNA–detection techniques. The second paragraph of the passage states that these ecologists believed viral disease contributed to population decline that was already underway rather than initiating it.

A The second paragraph states that viral disease had been reported; thus, population ecologists were aware of its existence in insect populations. The passage is consistent with ecologists having believed that it was prevalent.
B The passage focuses mainly on the caterpillar life stage of lepidoptera, but there is nothing to suggest that scientists held particular beliefs regarding viral diseases’ restriction to that life stage.
C It is after, not before, the discovery of new techniques for detecting viral DNA when populations ecologists came to believe that such diseases were the driving force behind the population cycles.

The passage states in the second paragraph that these viruses remain virulent for many years if they are protected from direct sunlight. They are embedded in crystals of polyhedrin protein.

The passage indicates that the polyhedrin protein crystals protect the nuclear polyhedrosis virus when it is in the environment. When a caterpillar ingests those crystals, they dissolve. That releases the virus, whereupon it infects the caterpillar’s cells. Thus it is reasonable to infer that the virus must be released from the crystals before it can infect the caterpillar.

A The passage states that nuclear polyhedrosis viruses remain embedded in polyhedrin protein crystals if protected from direct sunlight, not that the virus is exposed to light when it is in the protein crystals.
B Nothing in the passage indicates that any organism preys on the virus itself or that it attracts predators to caterpillars that it infects.
C Correct. The virus must be released from the crystals before it can infect caterpillars’ cells.
D The passage states that caterpillars ingest the polyhedrin protein crystals.
E According to the passage, new techniques of molecular biology enable the detection of viral DNA in the environment. The nuclear polyhedrosis virus persists in the environment inside protein crystals.

Since the word
suggests
is used in the question, the answer is probably not directly stated in the passage and therefore has to be inferred. The author believes that the rise in temporary employment during the 1980s can be explained by two factors affecting employers:
product demand
and
labor’s reduced bargaining strength
. Temporary employment allows employers to adapt their workforce to the fluctuating demand for their product. At this time,
labor’s reduced bargaining strength
left employers, not workers, in greater control of the terms of employment.

A This goes too far beyond the information provided in the passage. The passage neither says nor implies anything about efficiency levels before the 1980s.

In its context in this passage, the word
excessive
indicates a value-judgment by the author. The author recommends that firms be
discouraged from creating excessive numbers of temporary positions
on the basis of the statistical analyses, which show that the rise in temporary employment
now far exceeds the level explainable by recent workforce entry rates of groups said to prefer temporary jobs
. In the context of lines 23–29, it is clear that the author believes that the large expansion in temporary employment exclusively serves employer interests at the expense of employee interests (including their preferences), and is, for that reason, excessive.

A Correct. An expansion of temporary employment that serves employer interests more than it serves employee interests (such as preferences) is considered by the author to be excessive .
B It is not because the expansion in temporary employment allows employers to respond to fluctuations in product demand that the author regards the expansion as excessive .
C The relation of temporary employment to the success of firms is not discussed.
D The relation of temporary employment to an expanding economy is not discussed.
E The author does not consider the issue of overall increases in the workforce as a whole, only the issue of increases in temporary employment.

RCQ55,RCP12,"It can be inferred from the passage that a large plant might have to spend more than a similar but smaller plant on environmental compliance because the larger plant is
(A) more likely to attract attention from local regulators
(B) less likely to be exempt from permit and reporting requirements
(C) less likely to have regulatory costs passed on to it by companies that supply its raw materials
(D) more likely to employ older production technologies
(E) more likely to generate wastes that are more environmentally damaging than those generated by smaller plants",B,"Inference

This item depends on understanding the implications of the passage’s discussion of differences between large and small plants. It asks what might be true of a larger plant that would compel it to spend more than a smaller plant on environmental compliance. The passage addresses this issue by stating that smaller plants are often not subject to the same permit or reporting requirements that larger plants are.

A The likelihood of attracting regulatory attention is discussed only in the context of comparing plants that are isolated with small plants that are near large noncompliant ones. The passage does not suggest that size is generally the crucial determining factor in attracting regulatory attention.
B Correct. According to the passage, certain permit or reporting requirements may not apply to smaller plants; this suggests that larger plants are less likely than smaller plants to be exempt from these requirements, and thus that the larger plants would have to spend more to comply.
C The passage does not discuss the passing on of regulatory costs from suppliers to plants.
D The passage does not suggest that larger plants are any more likely than smaller plants to employ older production technologies.
E The passage does not distinguish between the types of wastes emitted by larger plants and those emitted by smaller plants.

The correct answer is B.","Among the myths taken as fact by the
 environmental managers of most corporations is
 the belief that environmental regulations affect all
 competitors in a given industry uniformly. In reality,
 regulatory costs—and therefore compliance—fall
 unevenly, economically disadvantaging some
 companies and benefiting others. For example, a
 plant situated near a number of larger
 noncompliant competitors is less likely to attract
 the attention of local regulators than is an isolated
 plant, and less attention means lower costs.
 Additionally, large plants can spread compliance
 costs such as waste treatment across a larger
 revenue base; on the other hand, some smaller
 plants may not even be subject to certain
 provisions such as permit or reporting
 requirements by virtue of their size. Finally, older
 production technologies often continue to generate
 toxic wastes that were not regulated when the
 technology was first adopted. New regulations
 have imposed extensive compliance costs on
 companies still using older industrial coal-fired
 burners that generate high sulfur dioxide and
 nitrogen oxide outputs, for example, whereas new

This item depends on identifying what the passage states explicitly about outputs of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. The passage says that plants that produce these outputs are those that use older industrial coal-fired burners, and that such plants are subject to extensive compliance costs imposed by new regulations.

A The passage does not address the question of whether older production technologies might be adapted to reduce outputs of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.
B The passage states that new regulations have imposed high compliance costs on companies that produce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs, not that these outputs are prohibited.
C Correct. The passage states that some companies are still using the older kinds of burners that generate sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs, and that new regulations have imposed high compliance costs on these companies.
D The passage does not address the question of whether older plants have developed new processes to reduce the amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide they produce.
E Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs, the passage suggests, are produced only by older industrial coal-fired burners; newer facilities (using alternative processes) do not employ this technology, the expense of which is not mentioned in the passage.

This question asks about the role played in the passage by the following statement:
Additionally, large plants can spread compliance costs such as waste treatment across a larger revenue base; on the other hand, some smaller plants may not even be subject to certain provisions such as permit or reporting requirements by virtue of their size
. This statement describes situations in which compliance costs for plants of different sizes may differ, which serve as evidence in support of the passage’s main claim: that environmental regulations do
not
affect all competitors in a given industry uniformly.

A The statement in question is not a hypothesis; rather, it reports factors that are known to affect the varying impact of environmental regulations.
B This is too vague to be a good description of the kind of relationship the question asks about. The highlighted statement does present a contrast—it suggests that larger plants’ compliance costs are lower under some circumstances, while smaller plants’ compliance costs are lower under other circumstances. But this purports to state two facts rather than mere ideas ; they are contrasting facts but not in any meaningful sense opposed , since they can easily coexist.
C Correct. The statement provides examples to support the initial claim made in the passage that regulatory costs fall unevenly on competitors in an industry: large plants can spread compliance costs around, and smaller plants may not even have to pay certain costs.
D This statement helps to dispel, not exemplify, a misconception mentioned earlier in the passage—i.e., the myth that environmental regulations affect all companies in an industry the same way.
E The statement does not suggest that the situation of larger and smaller plants is similar (or analogous) to any other situation mentioned in the passage.

This question depends on understanding the passage as a whole. Its first sentence indicates its main purpose: to dispel a myth about environmental regulations that is often taken as fact.

B The passage refers to variations in firms’ levels of compliance with environmental regulations, but its primary purpose is not to illustrate those varying levels, nor does it do so.
C The passage suggests that most environmental managers are mistaken about a key concept; its primary purpose is not to describe traditional methods of environmental management or alternatives to those traditional methods, nor does it do so.

(B) It was rescinded by the federal government, an action that gave rise to the Winters case.
(C) It cited American Indians’ traditional use of the land’s resources.
(D) It failed to mention water rights to be enjoyed by the reservation’s inhabitants.
(E) It was modified by the Supreme Court in Arizona v. California.",D,"Supporting ideas

This question requires recognizing information that is explicitly stated in the passage. In the first sentence, the passage states that the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation was established by treaty. The following sentence begins by stating that this treaty
did not mention water rights
(lines 5–6); in other words, the right to use the water flowing through the reservation was not established by treaty.

A Although the Supreme Court ruled on water rights for the reservation established by the treaty, there is no evidence in the passage that the treaty itself was ever challenged in the Supreme Court.
B Although the Winters case resulted in water rights for the reservation established by the treaty, there is no evidence in the passage that the treaty was ever rescinded.
C The passage does not mention American Indians’ traditional resource use as being tied to the treaty establishing the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation.
D Correct. The passage states explicitly that the treaty establishing the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation did not mention the right to use water flowing through the reservation.
E The passage does not mention the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation or the treaty that established it in relation to Arizona v. California .

The correct answer is D.","In Winters v. United States , the Supreme
 Court held that the right to use waters flowing through
 or adjacent to the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation
 was reserved to American Indians by the treaty
 establishing the reservation. Although this treaty did
 not mention water rights, the Court ruled that the
 federal government, when it created the reservation,
 intended to deal fairly with American Indians by
 reserving for them the waters without which their
 lands would have been useless. Later decisions, citing
 Winters, established that courts can find federal rights
 to reserve water for particular purposes if the land
 in question lies within an enclave under exclusive
 federal jurisdiction, the land has been formally
 withdrawn from federal public lands—i.e., withdrawn
 from the stock of federal lands available for private
 use under federal land use laws—and set aside or
 reserved, and the circumstances reveal the
 government intended to reserve water as well as land
 when establishing the reservation.
 Some American Indian tribes have also established
 water rights through the courts based on their
 traditional diversion and use of certain waters prior to
 the United States’ acquisition of sovereignty. For
 example, the Rio Grande pueblos already existed
 when the United States acquired sovereignty over
 New Mexico in 1848. Although they at that time
 became part of the United States, the pueblo lands
 never formally constituted a part of federal public
 lands; in any event, no treaty, statute, or executive
 order has ever designated or withdrawn the pueblos
 from public lands as American Indian reservations.
 This fact, however, has not barred application of the
 Winters doctrine. What constitutes an American Indian
 reservation is a question of practice, not of legal
 definition, and the pueblos have always been treated
 as reservations by the United States. This pragmatic

 in which any type of federal reservation is created

 rights as of 1848, the year in which pueblos must be
 considered to have become reservations."
RCQ60,RCP13,"The passage suggests that, if the criteria discussed in lines 10–20 were the only criteria for establishing a reservation’s water rights, which of the following would be true?
(A) The water rights of the inhabitants of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation would not take precedence over those of other citizens.
(B) Reservations established before 1848 would be judged to have no water rights.
(C) There would be no legal basis for the water rights of the Rio Grande pueblos.
(D) Reservations other than American Indian reservations could not be created with reserved water rights.
(E) Treaties establishing reservations would have to mention water rights explicitly in order to reserve water for a particular purpose.",C,"Inference

Answering this question requires making an inference based on information given in the passage. The question focuses on lines 10–20, where the passage provides a summary of the criteria used by the U.S. courts to establish water rights. The passage then explains that the Rio Grande pueblos used other means to establish water rights, noting that what
constitutes an American Indian reservation is a question of practice, not of legal definition
(lines 34–36). This strongly implies that establishing water rights for the Rio Grande pueblos required reference to legal language not contained in the criteria described in lines 10–20.

A Since the passage says that decisions setting the criteria in lines 10–20 cited the Winters case—which gave water rights to the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation—one can infer that the Fort Belknap reservation met all of those criteria.
B The criteria in lines 10–20 do not touch on specific dates of the transfer of sovereignty over particular lands.
C Correct. The passage demonstrates that for the Rio Grande pueblos, it was necessary to establish water rights based on criteria not contained in lines 10–20.
D The criteria described in lines 10–20 are not specific only to lands reserved for American Indians.
E The passage illustrates that Winters established water rights in the absence of any explicit mention of water rights in the treaty.

(B) Arizona v. California establishes that the Winters doctrine applies to a broader range of situations than those defined by these criteria.
(C) Arizona v. California represents the sole example of an exception to the criteria as they were set forth in the Winters doctrine.
(D) Arizona v. California does not refer to the Winters doctrine to justify water rights, whereas these criteria do rely on the Winters doctrine.
(E) Arizona v. California applies the criteria derived from the Winters doctrine only to federal lands other than American Indian reservations.",B,"Inference

This question requires inferring how one part of the passage bears on another part of the passage. The two parts referred to are the criteria described in lines 10–20 and
Arizona v. California
, which is referred to in lines 38–45.
Arizona v. California
shows that the establishment of water rights need not be tied to any previous legal definition of reservation lands but may be tied to the U.S. government’s practice merely of treating the land as reserved for American Indians. The criteria described in lines 10–20 apply to situations in which the land in question has been legally identified as reservation land. So
Arizona v. California
broadened the scope of
Winters
in establishing water rights.

A The passage illustrates that Arizona v. California does not supersede or deny any of the criteria in lines 10–20.
B Correct. The passage suggests that practice and not legal definition (lines 34–36) allows Winters to be applied to situations not covered by the criteria in lines 10–20.
C In stating that some American Indian tribes have also established water rights by means other than the criteria in lines 10–20, the first sentence of the second paragraph makes clear that Arizona v. California is not the sole exception to the criteria.
D The passage states that Arizona v. California does refer to Winters .
E The passage illustrates that Arizona v. California was directly relevant to the Pueblo Indians’ water rights.

This question requires recognizing what a particular phrase in the passage is referring to. The pragmatic approach the question refers to is introduced by the passage as
this

(E) Suggest that federal courts cannot claim jurisdiction over cases disputing the traditional diversion and use of water by Pueblo Indians",A,"Evaluation

Answering this question involves recognizing how a particular part of the passage functions within the passage as a whole. The passage illustrates in the first paragraph that
Winters
was cited in the establishment of water rights based on a set of criteria that included the formal withdrawal of lands by the government. In the second paragraph, the case of the Rio Grande pueblos is introduced as an example of lands that had never been formally withdrawn by the government, raising the question of whether
Winters
would still be applicable in such situations. The passage then asserts that the situation of the pueblos
has not barred
(line 33) the application of
Winters
.

A Correct. While the passage affirms the application of Winters to the situation with the pueblos, it recognizes that it may initially appear that Winters does not apply.
B The passage states explicitly that the United States did gain official sovereignty over pueblo lands in 1848, when they became part of the United States (lines 27–28).
C The passage states explicitly that the pueblo lands never formally constituted a part of federal public lands (lines 28–30) and takes no stand on the issue of whether particular lands ought to be considered public lands.
D While one can infer that the rights of other citizens to use water could be limited by reserving water rights for residents of American Indian lands according to the Winters doctrine, the passage takes no stand on this issue.
E The passage does not mention the rights of federal courts to claim jurisdiction over particular water rights cases.

The correct answer is A.","In Winters v. United States , the Supreme
 Court held that the right to use waters flowing through
 or adjacent to the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation
 was reserved to American Indians by the treaty
 establishing the reservation. Although this treaty did
 not mention water rights, the Court ruled that the
 federal government, when it created the reservation,
 intended to deal fairly with American Indians by
 reserving for them the waters without which their
 lands would have been useless. Later decisions, citing
 Winters, established that courts can find federal rights
 to reserve water for particular purposes if the land
 in question lies within an enclave under exclusive
 federal jurisdiction, the land has been formally
 withdrawn from federal public lands—i.e., withdrawn
 from the stock of federal lands available for private
 use under federal land use laws—and set aside or
 reserved, and the circumstances reveal the
 government intended to reserve water as well as land
 when establishing the reservation.
 Some American Indian tribes have also established
 water rights through the courts based on their
 traditional diversion and use of certain waters prior to
 the United States’ acquisition of sovereignty. For
 example, the Rio Grande pueblos already existed
 when the United States acquired sovereignty over
 New Mexico in 1848. Although they at that time
 became part of the United States, the pueblo lands
 never formally constituted a part of federal public
 lands; in any event, no treaty, statute, or executive
 order has ever designated or withdrawn the pueblos
 from public lands as American Indian reservations.
 This fact, however, has not barred application of the
 Winters doctrine. What constitutes an American Indian

This question requires recognizing the main topic of the passage, which is about the establishment of water rights on American Indian lands. Its intent is to explain or describe, and it does not take sides on any issue.

C The passage describes legal criteria used to establish water rights on American Indian lands but does not take issue with them.
D The passage does not discuss the earliest date for water rights on American Indian lands.
E The passage is primarily about establishing water rights, not about types of reservations.

Answering this question requires recognizing what the passage implies. The passage illustrates at the beginning of the second paragraph that water rights were granted to Pueblo Indians based on their use of the water in the Rio Grande pueblos prior to U.S. sovereignty. The passage also later states that since the
Winters
doctrine applies, the water rights of Pueblo Indians
have priority over other citizens’ water rights as of 1848
(lines 42–44), which implies that the water rights of citizens other than Pueblo Indians are limited.

A The passage illustrates that Arizona v. California reinforced the water rights of citizens residing on American Indian reservations; it does not imply a precedent ensuring water rights for other citizens.
B The passage states that the water rights of citizens other than Pueblo Indians are lower in priority, not abolished altogether.
C The passage does not mention that different water rights have been defined by different treaties.
D The passage does not mention that the water rights of citizens other than Pueblo Indians are guaranteed on pueblo lands.
E Correct. The passage states that the water rights of Pueblo Indians have priority over other citizens’ water rights, which thereby limits the rights of those citizens.

RCQ66,RCP14,"In the passage, the author is primarily interested in
(A) suggesting an alternative to an outdated research method
(B) introducing a new research method that calls an accepted theory into question
(C) emphasizing the instability of data gathered from the application of a new scientific method
(D) presenting a theory and describing a new method to test that theory
(E) initiating a debate about a widely accepted theory",D,"Main idea

This question concerns the main point of the passage. A careful examination of the overall structure of the passage will reveal the main point. In the first paragraph, the author briefly presents Milankovitch’s theory and explains why it could not be tested early on. In the second and third paragraphs, the author describes how a new method allows testing of the theory and shows how evidence from the testing supports the theory. While the final paragraph acknowledges that other factors should be considered, the author’s primary interest in this passage is in presenting Milankovitch’s theory and the recently discovered method for testing it.

A A new research method is described, but no previous method is discussed.
B As described in the passage, the new method tests and confirms the theory; there is no mention that the theory is accepted or that the method casts doubt on it.
C Nothing in the passage suggests that “instability of data” is an issue.
D Correct. The author presents Milankovitch’s theory and describes the oxygen isotope method of testing it.
E The theory is nowhere said to be “widely accepted” and the author does not debate the theory.

The correct answer is D.","Milankovitch proposed in the early twentieth
 century that the ice ages were caused by variations
 in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. For some time
 this theory was considered untestable, largely
 because there was no sufficiently precise
 chronology of the ice ages with which the orbital
 variations could be matched.
 To establish such a chronology it is necessary to
 determine the relative amounts of land ice that
 existed at various times in the Earth’s past. A
 recent discovery makes such a determination
 possible: relative land-ice volume for a given period
 can be deduced from the ratio of two oxygen
 isotopes, 16 and 18, found in ocean sediments.
 Almost all the oxygen in water is oxygen 16, but a
 few molecules out of every thousand incorporate
 the heavier isotope 18. When an ice age begins, the
 continental ice sheets grow, steadily reducing the
 amount of water evaporated from the ocean that
 will eventually return to it. Because heavier
 isotopes tend to be left behind when water
 evaporates from the ocean surfaces, the remaining
 ocean water becomes progressively enriched in
 oxygen 18. The degree of enrichment can be
 determined by analyzing ocean sediments of the
 period, because these sediments are composed of
 calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms,
 shells that were constructed with oxygen atoms
 drawn from the surrounding ocean. The higher the
 ratio of oxygen 18 to oxygen 16 in a sedimentary
 specimen, the more land ice there was when the
 sediment was laid down.
 As an indicator of shifts in the Earth’s climate,
 the isotope record has two advantages. First, it is a
 global record: there is remarkably little variation in
 isotope ratios in sedimentary specimens taken
 from different continental locations. Second, it is a
 more continuous record than that taken from rocks
 on land. Because of these advantages, sedimentary
 evidence can be dated with sufficient accuracy by
 radiometric methods to establish a precise
 chronology of the ice ages. The dated isotope
 record shows that the fluctuations in global ice
 volume over the past several hundred thousand
 years have a pattern: an ice age occurs roughly
 once every 100,000 years. These data have
 established a strong connection between variations
 in the Earth’s orbit and the periodicity of the ice ages.
 However, it is important to note that other
 factors, such as volcanic particulates or variations
 in the amount of sunlight received by the Earth,
 could potentially have affected the climate. The
 advantage of the Milankovitch theory is that it is
 testable; changes in the Earth’s orbit can be
 calculated and dated by applying Newton’s laws of
 gravity to progressively earlier configurations of the
 bodies in the solar system. Yet the lack of
 information about other possible factors affecting
 global climate does not make them unimportant."
RCQ67,RCP14,"The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements about the Milankovitch theory?
(A) It is the only possible explanation for the ice ages.
(B) It is too limited to provide a plausible explanation for the ice ages, despite recent research findings.
(C) It cannot be tested and confirmed until further research on volcanic activity is done.
(D) It is one plausible explanation, though not the only one, for the ice ages.
(E) It is not a plausible explanation for the ice ages, although it has opened up promising possibilities for future research.",D,"Application

The author’s reaction to the statements about the Milankovitch theory must be based on how the author treats the theory in the passage. The first, second, and third paragraphs describe the theory and the use of a new research method to test the theory. The passage states that data from these tests
have established a strong connection between variations in the Earth’s orbit and the periodicity of the ice ages
, suggesting that the author of the passage believes the theory is plausible. In the final paragraph, the author points to other factors that might be involved, suggesting that the theory might not provide a complete explanation.

A In the last paragraph, the author suggests that because there are still other untested factors that may have effects on climate, other explanations are possible.
B Though in the last paragraph the author points to other factors that may be involved, these are not presented by the author as indicating limitations that diminish the plausibility of the theory—they are acknowledged merely as possibilities that are not now understood—and nothing else in the passage suggests that the theory is “too limited.”
C The author shows how the theory has been tested; volcanic activity is not part of this theory.
D Correct. The author’s presentation of the theory and the tests of the theory show that the author finds the theory plausible; the mention of other factors shows the author does not think that all other explanations have been ruled out, even if they are as yet untested.
E The theory was a plausible explanation from its beginning, but it was not testable until recently; scientists would be unlikely to try to devise means to test a theory that did not strike them as antecedently plausible.

To make an inference about the isotope record from ocean sediments, examine what the passage says about that record. The third paragraph discusses that record and lists its two advantages. First, it is a global record with
remarkably little variation
in samples from varied locations. Second, it is
more continuous
than the record from rocks. If either of these advantages were not true, then it is logical to infer that the record would be less useful.

A According to lines 14–16, the lighter isotope does predominate; this is part of the record and does not affect its usefulness.
B Correct. In lines 37–42, the author states that an advantage of the ocean record is that it is a more continuous record than that taken from rocks on land . If this were not true, the ocean record would be less useful.
C If the record were to show that the shifts did not occur every 100,000 years, Milankovitch’s theory would be weakened. This impact on the theory does not make the isotope record less useful to researchers. The record is useful precisely because it can offer evidence to confirm or refute such theories.
D This inconsistency would not affect the usefulness of the ocean-water record. Researchers would simply need to accommodate the fresh-water inconsistency.
E The record would still be useful. Lines 42–46 attest to the establishment of a pattern based on data from the past several hundred thousand years .

The phrase
according to the passage

A There is no evidence in the passage about this point.

Any inference about precipitation from evaporated ocean water needs to be based on what the passage says. Lines 20–22 show that
heavier isotopes tend to be left behind when water evaporates from the ocean surfaces
. Therefore, the evaporated water would contain less oxygen 18 and the remaining ocean water would contain more. It is logical to infer that precipitation formed from this evaporated water would also contain less oxygen 18.

A Lines 20–24 explain that the water remaining in the ocean after evaporation has more oxygen 18.
B Correct. Since the heavier isotopes tend to be left behind , there will be less oxygen 18 in the evaporated water and in the precipitation that forms from it.
C The passage suggests that the ocean water evaporates and through subsequent precipitation helps form the ice sheets, so the amount of oxygen 18 in the ice sheets should be similar to the amount in the precipitation formed from the evaporated water.

(E) reflect the isotopic composition of the water at the time the shells were formed",E,"Inference

Any inference about calcium carbonate shells needs to be based on what the passage says about these shells. Lines 24–32 explain the role of these shells in forming sediments and establishing a chronology for ice ages. The shells
were constructed with oxygen atoms drawn from the surrounding ocean
. Lines 29–32 make it clear that if the sediments reveal a higher ratio of oxygen 18, it is because more oxygen 18 had been left behind when the ocean water evaporated and contributed to the growth of continental ice sheets. It can thus be inferred that the shells that make up those sediments must reflect the proportion of oxygen 18 found in the ocean water at the time they were formed.

A The only mention of rocks in the passage is a comparison of “gappiness” of the rock and sedimentary specimen records in lines 38–39; this information does not allow any firm inference to be made with respect to relative susceptibility to deterioration, though a more continuous record might be the result of less susceptibility to deterioration.
B The passage does not make any reference to the relative abundance of these shells during ice ages; no such inference can be drawn.
C The only information in the passage that might support this statement is found in lines 29–32, but that information, about the correlation between oxygen ratios in sediment specimens and land ice, describes a relation that implies nothing about distributions of such specimens.
D Though the passage does indirectly indicate that the shells contained radioactive material, nothing in the passage suggests that radioactive material is used to determine isotopic composition.
E Correct. The passage explains that oxygen atoms in the surrounding water are one of the building blocks of calcium carbonate shells. The isotopic composition of the surrounding water changes during the ice age cycles, so it is logical that the isotopic composition of the shells will change depending on when they were formed.

The correct answer is E.","Milankovitch proposed in the early twentieth
 century that the ice ages were caused by variations
 in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. For some time
 this theory was considered untestable, largely
 because there was no sufficiently precise
 chronology of the ice ages with which the orbital
 variations could be matched.
 To establish such a chronology it is necessary to
 determine the relative amounts of land ice that
 existed at various times in the Earth’s past. A
 recent discovery makes such a determination
 possible: relative land-ice volume for a given period
 can be deduced from the ratio of two oxygen
 isotopes, 16 and 18, found in ocean sediments.
 Almost all the oxygen in water is oxygen 16, but a
 few molecules out of every thousand incorporate
 the heavier isotope 18. When an ice age begins, the
 continental ice sheets grow, steadily reducing the
 amount of water evaporated from the ocean that
 will eventually return to it. Because heavier
 isotopes tend to be left behind when water
 evaporates from the ocean surfaces, the remaining
 ocean water becomes progressively enriched in
 oxygen 18. The degree of enrichment can be
 determined by analyzing ocean sediments of the
 period, because these sediments are composed of
 calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms,
 shells that were constructed with oxygen atoms
 drawn from the surrounding ocean. The higher the
 ratio of oxygen 18 to oxygen 16 in a sedimentary
 specimen, the more land ice there was when the
 sediment was laid down.
 As an indicator of shifts in the Earth’s climate,
 the isotope record has two advantages. First, it is a
 global record: there is remarkably little variation in
 isotope ratios in sedimentary specimens taken
 from different continental locations. Second, it is a
 more continuous record than that taken from rocks
 on land. Because of these advantages, sedimentary
 evidence can be dated with sufficient accuracy by
 radiometric methods to establish a precise
 chronology of the ice ages. The dated isotope
 record shows that the fluctuations in global ice
 volume over the past several hundred thousand
 years have a pattern: an ice age occurs roughly
 once every 100,000 years. These data have
 established a strong connection between variations
 in the Earth’s orbit and the periodicity of the ice ages.
 However, it is important to note that other
 factors, such as volcanic particulates or variations
 in the amount of sunlight received by the Earth,
 could potentially have affected the climate. The
 advantage of the Milankovitch theory is that it is
 testable; changes in the Earth’s orbit can be
 calculated and dated by applying Newton’s laws of
 gravity to progressively earlier configurations of the
 bodies in the solar system. Yet the lack of
 information about other possible factors affecting
 global climate does not make them unimportant."

(E) explain the prevalent perspective on a historiographical debate",D,"Main idea

This question requires understanding what the passage as a whole is attempting to do. The passage opens by introducing two books published in 1984 that both concern the history of women in the United States. The passage then makes it clear that one book deals
directly
(line 15) with the issue of women’s status, while the other does not. The passage then goes on to discuss the perspective that each book takes and what each book has to offer for an assessment of women’s status in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

A The two books discussed in the passage do not take different sides on a particular debate but rather are described as being more or less useful to the debate itself.
B The passage focuses on how two different books contain information useful to a particular historiographical debate but does not call into question the approach of either book.
C The passage focuses on two authors’ works, not one.
D Correct. The passage discusses what two different books have to offer in relation to a particular historiographical debate.
E The passage does not describe any perspective on a particular historiographical debate as being more prevalent than any other.

The correct answer is D.","Two works published in 1984 demonstrate
 contrasting approaches to writing the history of
 United States women. Buel and Buel’s biography
 of Mary Fish (1736–1818) makes little effort to
 place her story in the context of recent
 historiography on women. Lebsock, meanwhile,
 attempts not only to write the history of women in
 one southern community, but also to redirect two
 decades of historiographical debate as to
 whether women gained or lost status in the
 nineteenth century as compared with the
 eighteenth century. Although both books offer the
 reader the opportunity to assess this controversy
 regarding women’s status, only Lebsock’s deals
 with it directly. She examines several different
 aspects of women’s status, helping to refine and
 resolve the issues. She concludes that while
 women gained autonomy in some areas,
 especially in the private sphere, they lost it in
 many aspects of the economic sphere. More
 importantly, she shows that the debate itself
 depends on frame of reference: in many respects,
 women lost power in relation to men, for example,
 as certain jobs (delivering babies, supervising
 schools) were taken over by men. Yet women also
 gained power in comparison with their previous
 status, owning a higher proportion of real estate,
 for example. In contrast, Buel and Buel’s
 biography provides ample raw material for
 questioning the myth, fostered by some
 historians, of a colonial golden age in the
 eighteenth century but does not give the reader
 much guidance in analyzing the controversy over
 women’s status."

(E) illustrate how the answers to questions about women’s status depend on particular contexts",E,"Evaluation

Answering this question depends on understanding what role a particular piece of information plays in the passage as a whole. The author implicitly supports Lebsock’s contention (beginning at line 20) that different frames of reference can produce different perspectives on the debate about women’s status in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The author then summarizes different contexts cited by Lebsock to support the contention about frames of reference. As part of this summary, the author refers to
supervising schools
(lines 24–25) as an example of a job that apparently showed women losing power.

A The passage does not discuss the role of education in the nineteenth century.
B The passage does mention some ways in which, according to Lebsock, women . . . gained power (lines 25–26) in the nineteenth century, but supervising schools is not among them.
C The passage does not discuss the difficulty of obtaining data about particular occupations.
D The passage makes no judgments about the suitability for women of any jobs in the nineteenth century.
E Correct. The passage mentions supervising schools as part of an illustration of Lebsock’s claim that the debate about women’s status depends on the context being examined.

(C) Lebsock has addressed the controversy by using women’s current status as a frame of reference.
(D) Lebsock has analyzed statistics about occupations and property that were previously ignored.
(E) Lebsock has applied recent historiographical methods to the biography of a nineteenth-century woman.",B,"Supporting ideas

Answering this question requires recognizing information explicitly given in the passage. The passage introduces the work of Lebsock in line 6 and then goes on to describe several characteristics of Lebsock’s book. In lines 20–22, the author introduces Lebsock’s claim that the historiographical debate about women’s status is dependent on frame of reference and calls that claim important; the passage then gives an example showing how frame of reference affects views of women’s status. In so doing, the author displays an implicit agreement with Lebsock’s discussion on this point.

A The author of the passage portrays neither the place nor time period that Lebsock focuses on as having been neglected by historians.
B Correct. The author describes as important Lebsock’s idea that frame of reference informs the debate about women’s status.
C According to the passage, Lebsock’s book deals with women’s status in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, not the present status of women.
D The passage does not mention or imply that Lebsock analyzed statistics in writing her book.
E Although the passage does describe Lebsock’s book as pertaining to an ongoing historiographical debate, it identifies the book’s topic as women in one southern community (lines 7–8), not the life of a single woman.

As part of this description, the passage cites Lebsock’s conclusion that nineteenth-century women lost economic autonomy when compared to eighteenth-century women (lines 17–20).

A The passage states that in many ways women in the nineteenth century lost power in relation to men (line 23), which would imply that in those respects eighteenthcentury women had more power in relation to men, not less. The only increase mentioned in nineteenth-century women’s power is associated with owning more real estate.
B The passage states that more nineteenthcentury women owned real estate.
C Correct. As the passage states, Lebsock concluded that nineteenth-century women lost economic autonomy compared to eighteenth-century women.
D The passage states that nineteenth-century women gained more independence in their private lives.

Finding a title that best summarizes a passage requires examining the passage as a whole. This task is made easier by the fact that the second sentence of the first paragraph provides a topic sentence stating the main idea:
In recent studies, however, we have discovered that the production and release in brain neurons of the neurotransmitter serotonin . . . depend directly on the food that the body processes
. In the second paragraph, the authors cite the results of several studies relating neurotransmitter levels to eating meals and to injections of insulin. In the final paragraph, the authors discuss a study of the effect of a proteinrich meal on serotonin level. Thus, the correct title must show the relationship between food eaten and serotonin produced.

A The function of neurotransmitters is only briefly mentioned.
B The passage does not discuss the relation between diet and survival.
C There is no discussion of blood supply and the brain.
D While tyrosine is briefly mentioned, this was not a main focus of the studies.
E Correct. This title offers a summary of the article’s contents.

The correct answer is E.","It was once believed that the brain was
 independent of metabolic processes occurring
 elsewhere in the body. In recent studies, however,
 we have discovered that the production and release
 in brain neurons of the neurotransmitter serotonin
 (neurotransmitters are compounds that neurons use
 to transmit signals to other cells) depend directly on
 the food that the body processes.
 Our first studies sought to determine whether the
 increase in serotonin observed in rats given a large
 injection of the amino acid tryptophan might also
 occur after rats ate meals that change tryptophan
 levels in the blood. We found that, immediately after
 the rats began to eat, parallel elevations occurred in
 blood tryptophan, brain tryptophan, and brain
 serotonin levels. These findings suggested that the
 production and release of serotonin in brain neurons
 were normally coupled with blood-tryptophan
 increases. In later studies we found that injecting
 insulin into a rat’s bloodstream also caused parallel
 elevations in blood and brain tryptophan levels and
 in serotonin levels. We then decided to see whether
 the secretion of the animal’s own insulin similarly
 affected serotonin production.
 We gave the rats a carbohydrate-containing meal
 that we knew would elicit insulin secretion. As we
 had hypothesized, the blood tryptophan level and
 the concentrations of tryptophan and of serotonin in
 the brain increased after the meal.
 Surprisingly, however, when we added a large
 amount of protein to the meal, brain tryptophan and
 serotonin levels fell. Since protein contains
 tryptophan, why should it depress brain tryptophan
 levels? The answer lies in the mechanism that
 provides blood tryptophan to the brain cells. This
 same mechanism also provides the brain cells with
 other amino acids found in protein, such as tyrosine
 and leucine. The consumption of protein increases
 blood concentration of the other amino acids much
 more, proportionately, than it does that of tryptophan.
 The more protein is in a meal, the lower is the
 ratio of the resulting blood-tryptophan concentration
 to the concentration of competing amino acids, and
 the more slowly is tryptophan provided to the brain.
 Thus the more protein in a meal, the less serotonin
 subsequently produced and released."

We then decided to see whether the secretion of the animal’s own insulin similarly affected serotonin production. We gave the rats a carbohydrate-containing meal that we knew would elicit insulin secretion.
These sentences together show that the authors gave carbohydrates to the rats to cause the rats to secrete insulin.

A Lines 26–29 show that the carbohydrate increased the blood tryptophan level.
B Preventing disease was not part of the study.
C Correct. The authors had already tried injecting insulin; they then gave the rats carbohydrates to stimulate insulin production.
D The authors make no such claim about insulin.
E The study involving protein came later, so this could not have been the reason for giving the rats carbohydrates.

The correct answer is C.","It was once believed that the brain was

 the food that the body processes.

 injection of the amino acid tryptophan might also
 occur after rats ate meals that change tryptophan
 levels in the blood. We found that, immediately after
 the rats began to eat, parallel elevations occurred in
 blood tryptophan, brain tryptophan, and brain
 serotonin levels. These findings suggested that the
 production and release of serotonin in brain neurons
 were normally coupled with blood-tryptophan
 increases. In later studies we found that injecting
 insulin into a rat’s bloodstream also caused parallel
 elevations in blood and brain tryptophan levels and
 in serotonin levels. We then decided to see whether

 tryptophan, why should it depress brain tryptophan

Since the question refers to information given in the passage, the answer can be found by careful reading. In order to find an injection with a similar effect, look first at the effect of injecting insulin. In lines 19–22, the authors state that
injecting insulin . . . caused parallel elevations in blood and brain tryptophan levels and in serotonin levels
. The only other reference to injection occurs earlier in lines 10–13 where rats injected with tryptophan had increased serotonin levels; injecting tryptophan would obviously cause tryptophan levels to increase.

A No evidence suggests that tyrosine injection would have similar effects.
B The studies did not involve injecting leucine.

(D) Meals that had very low concentrations of tyrosine
(E) Meals that had very low concentrations of leucine",A,"Inference

Since this question asks for an inference, the answer is not directly stated in the passage; it must instead be derived from the information given. What kind of meals would NOT help a patient with low serotonin levels? Meals that increased serotonin would help the patient; meals that lowered serotonin would not. According to the last sentence in the passage,
the more protein in a meal, the less serotonin subsequently produced and released.
Therefore, high-protein meals would be LEAST likely to help the patient.

A Correct. Meals with very high levels of protein would tend to lower serotonin and thus to be less beneficial for the patient with inadequate serotonin levels.
B When rats ate a carbohydrate-containing meal, serotonin increased (lines 25–29). Therefore, these meals would tend to raise serotonin levels and so help the patient.
C In the study, meals that elicited insulin secretion raised serotonin levels.
D Since tyrosine is an amino acid found in protein, meals low in tyrosine would be low in protein and so would tend to raise serotonin levels and help the patient.
E Since leucine is an amino acid found in protein, meals low in leucine would be low in protein and so would tend to raise serotonin levels and help the patient.

When the authors discuss the results of adding protein to meals, they begin with the word
surprisingly
(line 30). The use of this word indicates that the results differed from the authors’ initial hypotheses. The results showed lowered serotonin. It is reasonable to conclude that the researchers initially hypothesized that serotonin levels would not decrease.

A Correct. The use of the word surprisingly in line 30 suggests that researchers thought serotonin levels would not decrease.
B The researchers had expected that tryptophan levels would not decrease, since protein contains tryptophan (lines 32–34).
C Since there is no discussion of the comparative levels of tyrosine and leucine, there was probably no hypothesis about these levels.
D In the passage insulin is explicitly discussed in relation to carbohydrates, and plays no role at all in the discussion of protein; this very strongly suggests that insulin production played no role in the authors’ decision to feed the rats large amounts of protein.
E Serotonin is the only neurotransmitter discussed in the research, so it is unlikely that the researchers had an initial hypothesis involving other neurotransmitters.

(D) At the time that the legislation concerning white lead factories was proposed, WIDC was primarily concerned with addressing health conditions in white lead factories, whereas WTUL was concerned with improving working conditions in all types of factories.
(E) At the time that WIDC was opposing legislative attempts to restrict women’s labor, WTUL had already ceased to do so.",E,"Inference

To answer this question you need to understand the differences between WIDC and WTUL as they are described in the passage. The only information about WTUL in the passage is that it had stopped opposing restrictions on women’s labor in the late 1880s, and that, because existing safety regulations were not being enforced, it supported the proposal to prohibit women from working in white lead factories. WIDC, on the other hand, was formed in 1892 specifically to oppose restrictions on women’s labor, and it opposed the proposal.

A According to the passage, WIDC did believe that existing safety regulations, if enforced, could prevent lead poisoning. WTUL may or may not have believed that the safety regulations needed to be strengthened; all the passage states is that WTUL did not believe that the safety regulations were likely to be enforced.
B The passage states that WTUL believed that because there were no unions to pressure employers, the employers would not comply with safety regulations. The passage does not present any information on which to base a conclusion about WIDC’s beliefs regarding union pressure on employers.
C Based on information in the passage, both WIDC and SPEW believed that enforcing safety regulations could protect women against lead poisoning. WIDC supported SPEW’s position on the matter. WTUL believed that safety regulations were unlikely to be enforced because of the lack of unions.
D The passage states that WIDC viewed the proposal to restrict women’s employment in white lead factories as an instance of legislation designed to limit women’s work opportunities—precisely the legislation that WIDC was formed to oppose. Thus, WIDC was not primarily concerned with the factories’ health conditions.
E Correct. WIDC began opposing legislative attempts to restrict women’s labor in 1892 and continued to do so through at least 1895, when the Home Secretary proposed prohibiting women from working in white lead factories. WTUL stopped opposing restrictions on women’s labor in the late 1880s, before WIDC was even founded. Thus, the passage suggests that WTUL had stopped opposing restrictions on women’s labor well before WIDC worked to oppose such legislation.

The correct answer is E.","Acting on the recommendation of a British
 government committee investigating the high
 incidence in white lead factories of illness among
 employees, most of whom were women, the Home
 Secretary proposed in 1895 that Parliament enact
 legislation that would prohibit women from holding
 most jobs in white lead factories. Although the
 Women’s Industrial Defence Committee (WIDC),
 formed in 1892 in response to earlier legislative
 attempts to restrict women’s labor, did not discount
 the white lead trade’s potential health dangers, it
 opposed the proposal, viewing it as yet another
 instance of limiting women’s work opportunities.
 Also opposing the proposal was the Society for
 Promoting the Employment of Women (SPEW),
 which attempted to challenge it by investigating the
 causes of illness in white lead factories. SPEW
 contended, and WIDC concurred, that controllable
 conditions in such factories were responsible for
 the development of lead poisoning. SPEW provided
 convincing evidence that lead poisoning could be
 avoided if workers were careful and clean and if
 already extant workplace safety regulations were
 stringently enforced. However, the Women’s Trade
 Union League (WTUL), which had ceased in the late
 1880s to oppose restrictions on women’s labor,
 supported the eventually enacted proposal, in part
 because safety regulations were generally not being
 enforced in white lead factories, where there were
 no unions (and little prospect of any) to pressure
 employers to comply with safety regulations."
RCQ88,RCP17,"Which of the following, if true, would most clearly support the contention attributed to SPEW in lines 17–20?
(A) Those white lead factories that most strongly enforced regulations concerning worker safety and hygiene had the lowest incidences of lead poisoning among employees.
(B) The incidence of lead poisoning was much higher among women who worked in white lead factories than among women who worked in other types of factories.
(C) There were many household sources of lead that could have contributed to the incidence of lead poisoning among women who also worked outside the home in the late nineteenth century.
(D) White lead factories were more stringent than were certain other types of factories in their enforcement of workplace safety regulations.
(E) Even brief exposure to the conditions typically found in white lead factories could cause lead poisoning among factory workers.",A,"Evaluation

This question requires the reader to find a statement that would provide additional support for the contention made in the following statement:
SPEW contended, and WIDC concurred, that controllable conditions in such factories were responsible for the development of lead poisoning.
Information suggesting that when conditions were controlled, lead poisoning was less likely to develop would provide support for SPEW’s contention.

A Correct. If incidences of lead poisoning were low in those factories that enforced hygiene and safety regulations, that would suggest that lead poisoning was not an inevitable result of working in a white lead factory—but rather that lead poisoning was the result of poor hygiene and safety practices.
B It would not be particularly surprising for the incidence of lead poisoning to be higher among women working in white lead factories than among women working in other kinds of factories—but such a finding would say nothing about whether controllable conditions had any effect on the development of lead poisoning.
C The existence of household sources of lead that might contribute to lead poisoning would weaken, not support, SPEW’s contention that controllable factory conditions were responsible for the development of lead poisoning.
D If white lead factories enforced workplace safety regulations more stringently than did some other types of factories, it might be the case that SPEW’s contention was incorrect: that even controlled conditions could not prevent a high incidence of lead poisoning.
E If the conditions typically found in white lead factories were particularly bad with regard to safety and hygiene, it could conceivably be the case that SPEW’s contention was true—that is, that the conditions that caused lead poisoning were controllable. But it might also be the case that an uncontrollable aspect of those conditions caused lead poisoning. Thus, this neither supports nor undermines SPEW’s contention clearly.

Answering this question depends on identifying the overall point of the passage. The passage is mainly concerned with explaining the reasons behind the positions taken by WIDC and SPEW, which opposed the proposal to enact legislation prohibiting women from holding most white lead factory jobs, and the reasoning of WTUL, which supported the proposal.

A The passage explains how WIDC viewed the proposal, but it does not indicate what any of the groups believed about the motivations of the Home Secretary, who made the proposal.
B Correct. The passage contrasts the reasoning of the WIDC and SPEW, both of which believed that enforcing safety regulations would make the proposed legislation unnecessary, with the reasoning of WTUL, which thought that safety regulations were unlikely to be enforced and thus supported the proposal.
C The passage simply states that the proposal was eventually enacted; it does not trace the process by which this occurred.
D The passage implies that WIDC and SPEW were unsuccessful in their opposition to the proposed legislation, but it identifies only one tactic used in opposition to it: SPEW’s attempt to challenge it by investigating the causes of lead poisoning.
E The passage does not evaluate the groups’ arguments concerning the proposed legislation; rather, it presents those arguments without comment on their quality or value.

A Correct. Duverger’s work was unique because it used election data and survey data together.
B The two data types had never before been used together in such a study; they may well have been used separately in many earlier political studies.
C The second paragraph states that Duverger placed his findings in the context of historical processes, but not that he was unique in doing so (lines 15–17).

The comparison of voting rates is discussed at the end of the first paragraph and forms the basis for the required inference. Duverger found that
women voted somewhat less frequently than men
but that this difference narrowed
the longer the women had the vote
(lines 9–11). That is, there was an ongoing process of convergence in voting rates for women and men, as the time period for which women had the vote lengthened. This suggests that at one end, when women had been voting for the shortest time, voting rates were most dissimilar, and at the other end, when women had been voting for the longest time, the rates were most similar.

A Women’s political activism is not suggested as a reason for the difference.
B Women’s political candidacy is not suggested as a reason for the difference.
C Women’s political views are not suggested as a reason for the difference.

(D) highlight an apparent tension between Royalist ideology and the ideas of early feminists
(E) argue that Royalists held conflicting opinions on issues of family organization and women’s political rights",D,"Evaluation

This question asks about the role of Filmer in the passage. The author states that Filmer’s radical patriarchalism is associated with Royalist ideology and then goes on to define radical patriarchalism as an ideology that asserts the power of the king and the male head of the household. Early feminists, however, questioned the subordination of women in marriage. Thus, there seems to be a conflict between these two sets of ideas.

A Although the passage refers to Filmer’s view as radical patriarcalism , it provides no evidence regarding any differences in the degrees to which historians consider that view, or Royalism in general, to be radical.
B Filmer’s work supports the claim that patriarchalism was the basis of Royalist ideology; it does not qualify such a claim.
C That Filmer’s approach was one of radical patriarchalism makes it surprising that early feminists were associated with the Royalist faction, but it does not provide any grounds for questioning whether they were so associated.
D Correct. There is apparent tension between Filmer’s radical patriarchalism, if that is indeed essential to Royalist ideology, and the ideas of early feminists, who questioned such patriarchalism.
E The author refers to Filmer in order to suggest, initially, a uniformity among Royalists regarding family and women; it is only later in the passage that this view becomes more complicated.

The correct answer is D.","It is an odd but indisputable fact that the
 seventeenth-century English women who are
 generally regarded as among the forerunners of
 modern feminism are almost all identified with the
 Royalist side in the conflict between Royalists and

 Since Royalist ideology is often associated with the
 radical patriarchalism of seventeenth-century
 political theorist Robert Filmer—a patriarchalism
 that equates family and kingdom and asserts the
 divinely ordained absolute power of the king and,
 by analogy, of the male head of the household—
 historians have been understandably puzzled by the
 fact that Royalist women wrote the earliest
 extended criticisms of the absolute subordination of
 women in marriage and the earliest systematic
 assertions of women’s rational and moral equality
 with men. Some historians have questioned the
 facile equation of Royalist ideology with Filmerian
 patriarchalism; and indeed, there may have been no

 woman could be, but knowing that as a woman she
 was excluded from the pursuit of power in the real

 “singularity,” Cavendish insisted that she was a self-
 sufficient being within her mental empire, the center
 of her own subjective universe rather than a
 satellite orbiting a dominant male planet. In
 justifying this absolute singularity, Cavendish
 repeatedly invoked the model of the absolute
 monarch, a figure that became a metaphor for the
 self-enclosed, autonomous nature of the individual

The first sentence of the passage refers to women who are both regarded as forerunners of modern feminism and identified as Royalists. The passage goes on to suggest that, given Royalist ideology’s association with Filmer’s radical patriarchalism (equating absolute power of the king with absolute power of the male head of household), it is surprising that feminism would find any footing within such an ideology.

A Nothing in the passage disputes the idea that the seventeenth-century English women in question should be considered the forerunners of modern feminism.
B Gallagher provides the example of Margaret Cavendish as a writer who did openly challenge radical patriarchalism—albeit only in her writings.
C The passage states that Cavendish had successors among early feminists, but it does not indicate whether she herself was the first seventeenth-century English woman to assert women’s equality.
D The passage does not indicate what the Parliamentarian view of family organization and women’s political rights was, so there is no way to determine whether the Royalist forerunners of modern feminism were opposed to that view.
E Correct. The basic puzzle the passage sets out to solve is why the forerunners of modern feminism would have been associated with the Royalist side, which seems to have been based on radical patriarchalism. Historians would most likely have been less surprised if these women had been identified with the Parliamentarian side, which presumably did not embrace radical patriarchalism.

(D) analyze the causes for women’s exclusion from the pursuit of power
(E) create a world over which she could exercise total control",E,"Inference

This question asks about Margaret Cavendish’s reasons for becoming an author. The second paragraph describes her as someone who
insisted that she was a self-sufficient being
; she understood that, given the real-world strictures in place, she could achieve this self-sufficiency in her own mind and on paper as a writer. So her decision to become a writer can be inferred to be motivated by her desire to exercise power and control.

A The passage states that Cavendish justified her being the center of her own universe by invoking the Royalist figure of the absolute monarch; there is no suggestion in the passage that Cavendish felt the need to justify any support for the actual Royalist cause.
B The passage gives no direct indication that Cavendish was even aware of Filmerian patriarchalism.
C The second paragraph states that Cavendish’s idea of absolute singularity carried with it the idea of social and political isolation; Cavendish was most likely not motivated by a desire to persuade other women to break free from such isolation.
D Cavendish took the exclusion of women from the pursuit of power for granted; the passage does not suggest that she was concerned with its causes.

The phrase in question is
a satellite orbiting a dominant male planet
. The passage states that this was the idea that Cavendish was reacting against; she preferred instead the idea that she was the center of her own universe, her own sovereign, subject to no one.

A The idea of a satellite orbiting a dominant male planet refers not to Cavendish’s idea that each woman is a sovereign self, but rather to the idea directly opposed to that: each woman must submit to a dominant male.
B A satellite orbiting a dominant male planet is by definition not isolated, nor is it singular.

D Correct. The phrase refers to the idea that in a patriarchal society, women are as satellites to men, who are the dominant planets.

 patriarchalism; and indeed, there may have been no
 consistent differences between Royalists and
 Parliamentarians on issues of family organization
 and women’s political rights, but in that case one
 would expect early feminists to be equally divided
 between the two sides.
 Catherine Gallagher argues that Royalism
 engendered feminism because the ideology of
 absolute monarchy provided a transition to an
 ideology of the absolute self. She cites the example
 of the notoriously eccentric author Margaret
 Cavendish (1626–1673), duchess of Newcastle.
 Cavendish claimed to be as ambitious as any
 woman could be, but knowing that as a woman she
 was excluded from the pursuit of power in the real
 world, she resolved to be mistress of her own
 world, the “immaterial world” that any person can
 create within her own mind—and, as a writer, on
 paper. In proclaiming what she called her
 “singularity,” Cavendish insisted that she was a self-
 sufficient being within her mental empire, the center
 of her own subjective universe rather than a
 satellite orbiting a dominant male planet. In
 justifying this absolute singularity, Cavendish
 repeatedly invoked the model of the absolute
 monarch, a figure that became a metaphor for the
 self-enclosed, autonomous nature of the individual
 person. Cavendish’s successors among early
 feminists retained her notion of woman’s sovereign
 self, but they also sought to break free from the
 complete political and social isolation that her
 absolute singularity entailed."
RCQ101,RCP19,"Which of the following, if true, would most clearly undermine Gallagher’s explanation of the link between Royalism and feminism?
(A) Because of their privileged backgrounds, Royalist women were generally better educated than were their Parliamentarian counterparts.
(B) Filmer himself had read some of Cavendish’s early writings and was highly critical of her ideas.
(C) Cavendish’s views were highly individual and were not shared by the other Royalist women who wrote early feminist works.
(D) The Royalist and Parliamentarian ideologies were largely in agreement on issues of family organization and women’s political rights.
(E) The Royalist side included a sizable minority faction that was opposed to the more radical tendencies of Filmerian patriarchalism.",C,"Inference

This question asks about how to undermine the way in which Gallagher connects Royalism and feminism. According to Gallagher, Cavendish’s work exemplifies the connection between these ideas, because Cavendish took the idea of absolute monarchy and extended that to the idea of absolute self, an idea that should, Cavendish believed, apply to women as well as men.

A Gallagher’s explanation of the link between Royalism and feminism does not depend on the education level of Royalist women relative to Parliamentarian women.
B Filmer most likely would have been critical of Cavendish’s ideas, had he encountered them, but the passage does not indicate that Gallagher’s argument had anything to do with whether Filmer read Cavendish’s writings.
C Correct. Gallagher uses Cavendish’s work to explain how Royalism gave rise to feminism, but if Cavendish’s views were completely atypical of other Royalist women, then those views cannot explain the link as Gallagher suggests they do.
D The passage states in the first paragraph that if the Royalists and Parliamentarians were in agreement on issues of family organization and women’s political rights , then feminists should have been divided between the two sides—but they were not. So this idea, if true, would undermine that statement, but not Gallagher’s argument about the link between Royalists and feminists.
E If more Royalists were opposed to Filmer’s radical patriarchalism, then Cavendish’s writings would seem to be more representative of tendencies in Royalist ideology, thus making Gallagher’s case stronger, not weaker.

The correct answer is C.","It is an odd but indisputable fact that the
 seventeenth-century English women who are
 generally regarded as among the forerunners of
 modern feminism are almost all identified with the
 Royalist side in the conflict between Royalists and
 Parliamentarians known as the English Civil Wars.
 Since Royalist ideology is often associated with the
 radical patriarchalism of seventeenth-century
 political theorist Robert Filmer—a patriarchalism
 that equates family and kingdom and asserts the
 divinely ordained absolute power of the king and,
 by analogy, of the male head of the household—
 historians have been understandably puzzled by the
 fact that Royalist women wrote the earliest
 extended criticisms of the absolute subordination of
 women in marriage and the earliest systematic
 assertions of women’s rational and moral equality
 with men. Some historians have questioned the
 facile equation of Royalist ideology with Filmerian
 patriarchalism; and indeed, there may have been no
 consistent differences between Royalists and
 Parliamentarians on issues of family organization
 and women’s political rights, but in that case one

(D) describing proposed changes to the ways in which clinical trials are conducted
(E) explaining how medical researchers have traditionally conducted clinical trials and how such trials are likely to change",D,"Main idea

This question requires an understanding of what the passage as a whole is doing. The passage introduces Frazier and Mosteller as proposing changes to the ways clinical trials in medical research are currently conducted. The rest of the passage then describes these proposed changes together with the support Frazier and Mosteller provide for adopting these changes.

A The passage identifies practices in medical research to help illustrate the basis for Frazier and Mosteller’s proposed changes.
B The passage mentions medical research costs as one example within the larger description of Frazier and Mosteller’s proposed changes.
C The passage is not concerned with evaluating Frazier and Mosteller’s proposed changes.
D Correct. The passage describes the changes proposed by Frazier and Mosteller to the way clinical trials are conducted.
E The passage is not concerned with establishing the likelihood of any changes to the way medical research is conducted.

The correct answer is D.","Frazier and Mosteller assert that medical research
 could be improved by a move toward larger, simpler
 clinical trials of medical treatments. Currently,
 researchers collect far more background information
 on patients than is strictly required for their trials—
 substantially more than hospitals collect—thereby
 escalating costs of data collection, storage, and
 analysis. Although limiting information collection
 could increase the risk that researchers will overlook
 facts relevant to a study, Frazier and Mosteller
 contend that such risk, never entirely eliminable from
 research, would still be small in most studies. Only in
 research on entirely new treatments are new and
 unexpected variables likely to arise.
 Frazier and Mosteller propose not only that
 researchers limit data collection on individual
 patients but also that researchers enroll more
 patients in clinical trials, thereby obtaining a more
 representative sample of the total population with
 the disease under study. Often researchers restrict
 study participation to patients who have no ailments
 besides those being studied. A treatment judged
 successful under these ideal conditions can then be
 evaluated under normal conditions. Broadening the
 range of trial participants, Frazier and Mosteller
 suggest, would enable researchers to evaluate a
 treatment’s efficacy for diverse patients under
 various conditions and to evaluate its effectiveness
 for different patient subgroups. For example, the
 value of a treatment for a progressive disease may
 vary according to a patient’s stage of disease.

(D) It would allow researchers to limit information collection without increasing the risk that important variables could be overlooked.
(E) Its findings would be more accurate if it concerned treatments for a progressive disease than if it concerned treatments for a nonprogressive disease.",A,"Inference

This question requires drawing an inference from information given in the passage. In describing the proposals put forth by Frazier and Mosteller, the passage states in lines 15–20 that they propose using more patients in clinical trials than are currently being used, and that the trials would thereby obtain
a more representative sample of the total population with the disease under study
. The passage then states that researchers often
restrict
(lines 20–22) their trials to certain types of patients, therefore limiting the applicability of their findings.

A Correct. The passage states that the researchers preferred to restrict the types of patients used in their studies, thereby using a less representative sample than if they used a more inclusive group of patients.
B The passage mentions the added expense of clinical trials only in relation to data storage, collection, and analysis.
C The passage describes the category of patients referred to as restricted and therefore unrepresentative of the total population.
D While the passage does mention the amount of data collected about an individual patient, that topic is not connected to the category of patients referred to in lines 20–22.
E The passage does not suggest that a study using the category of patients referred to would be more effective in investigating progressive diseases.

(E) It would enable researchers to assess the value of an experimental treatment for the average patient.",C,"Inference

This question requires understanding what the information in the passage implies. The passage explains that Frazier and Mosteller’s proposal involves enrolling more patients in clinical trials (lines 18–19) than is the case with the category of patients referred to. The passage then explains that broadening the range of trial participants would allow an evaluation of particular treatments
under various conditions
and
for different patient subgroups
(line 29). This strongly suggests that limiting the patients used to those described in the referred text would limit the number of variables researchers would need to consider.

A The passage suggests that not limiting the patients used in clinical trials will yield more data than restricting them will.
B The passage refers to the costs of clinical trials only as it concerns the collection, storage, and analysis of data collected from participants.
C Correct. By limiting the patients used to those having the ailment under study, the passage suggests that researchers need to consider fewer variables in their assessment of a treatment.
D The passage suggests that not limiting the types of patients used in clinical trials will better allow researchers to evaluate subgroups.
E The passage suggests that limiting the types of patients available for clinical trials results in data for specific, rather than average, populations.

Answering this question requires understanding how a particular piece of information functions in the passage as a whole. The passage is concerned with describing the proposals of Frazier and Mosteller. One of these proposals, described in the second paragraph, involves broadening the range of participants used in clinical trials. The passage states that in following this proposal, Frazier and Mosteller suggest that the effectiveness of treatments can be assessed for different patient subgroups. To affirm the value of broadening the range of participants, the passage then cites two examples of criteria by which relevant subgroups might be identified: disease stages and patients’ ages.

A The passage makes no judgment as to the value of the subgroups it refers to in relation to broadened participation in clinical trials.
B The passage does not call into question the potential effectiveness of Frazier and Mosteller’s proposals.
C The passage’s example of patients’ ages is not intended to be causally connected to its previous example regarding progressive diseases.
D Correct. Patients’ ages are referred to in the passage to identify subgroups that could be evaluated if the range of participants in clinical trials were broadened.
E The passage refers to patients’ ages in support of Frazier and Mosteller’s proposal that more patients be used in clinical trials.

This question asks for an identification of specific information given in the passage. The passage describes the proposals of Frazier and Mosteller as attempting to improve the way clinical trials have generally been conducted. In describing how current trials are generally conducted, the passage states that researchers
collect far more background information on patients than is strictly required for their trials
(lines 4–6) and that they therefore escalate the costs of the trials.

B The passage makes no judgment about the accuracy of the information collected by researchers who currently hold clinical trials.
C The passage states that the risk of overlooking relevant information in clinical trials is never entirely eliminable (line 11).

(A) assess the validity of a certain view
(B) distinguish between two phenomena
(C) identify the causes of a problem
(D) describe a disturbing trend
(E) allay concern about a particular phenomenon",A,"Main idea

This question requires understanding, in general terms, the purpose of the passage as a whole. The first paragraph identifies an area of concern: declines in amphibian populations may constitute a crisis, one that indicates humans’ catastrophic effects on the environment. The rest of the passage then goes on to evaluate, as the second paragraph states, whether claims of crisis-level extinctions as a result of human activity are valid. In making this evaluation, the passage discusses the possible causes of extinctions, biologists’ prioritization of population declines over extinctions, and the fact that we lack extensive long-term data on amphibian populations.

A Correct. The passage’s main purpose is to assess whether the view that humans are causing crisis-level declines in amphibian populations is valid.
B The passage takes care, particularly in the third paragraph, to distinguish between population declines and extinctions, but this is not its primary purpose.
C The passage makes clear that it is difficult to identify the real extent of the problem facing amphibian populations, much less identify its causes.
D The first paragraph notes what may seem to be a disturbing trend—the decline in amphibian populations—but the rest of the passage is concerned not with describing that trend in greater detail, but rather with determining whether it is in fact occurring.
E While the passage provides possible grounds for concluding that concern about declining amphibian populations is overblown, it concludes by suggesting that we might, because we lack data, doom species and ecosystems to extinction. Thus, the overall purpose is not to allay concern.

The correct answer is A.","There are recent reports of apparently drastic
 declines in amphibian populations and of extinctions
 of a number of the world’s endangered amphibian
 species. These declines, if real, may be signs of a
 general trend toward extinction, and many
 environmentalists have claimed that immediate
 environmental action is necessary to remedy this
 “amphibian crisis,” which, in their view, is an
 indicator of general and catastrophic environmental
 degradation due to human activity.
 To evaluate these claims, it is useful to make a
 preliminary distinction that is far too often ignored.
 A declining population should not be confused with
 an endangered one. An endangered population is
 always rare, almost always small, and, by definition,
 under constant threat of extinction even without a
 proximate cause in human activities. Its disappearance,
 however unfortunate, should come as no great
 surprise. Moreover, chance events—which may
 indicate nothing about the direction of trends in
 population size—may lead to its extinction. The
 probability of extinction due to such random factors
 depends on the population size and is independent
 of the prevailing direction of change in that size.
 For biologists, population declines are potentially
 more worrisome than extinctions. Persistent
 declines, especially in large populations, indicate a
 changed ecological context. Even here, distinctions
 must again be made among declines that are only
 apparent (in the sense that they are part of habitual
 cycles or of normal fluctuations), declines that take
 a population to some lower but still acceptable
 level, and those that threaten extinction (e.g., by
 taking the number of individuals below the minimum
 viable population). Anecdotal reports of population
 decreases cannot distinguish among these
 possibilities, and some amphibian populations have
 shown strong fluctuations in the past.
 It is indisputably true that there is simply not
 enough long-term scientific data on amphibian
 populations to enable researchers to identify real
 declines in amphibian populations. Many fairly
 common amphibian species declared all but extinct
 after severe declines in the 1950s and 1960s
 have subsequently recovered, and so might the

This question asks about the author’s view of the environmentalists mentioned in the first paragraph. These environmentalists have claimed, based on amphibian population declines, that the situation is a crisis and that immediate action must be taken. The author, however, states that the declines are only
apparently
drastic and questions whether they are real, thus suggesting that the environmentalists are drawing conclusions in the absence of a complete consideration of the situation.

A The passage indicates that anecdotal reports are insufficient, but so too are other resources. The fourth paragraph of the passage makes clear that there is not enough long-term data available on which to base conclusions about amphibian populations.
B The passage does not indicate that the environmentalists under discussion have conducted research on any animal species.
C The passage does not indicate that the environmentalists in question hold, with certainty, any particular view regarding population declines in general.
D Correct. The author argues that the recent declines may have several different causes, and that environmentalists have jumped to a conclusion about the cause of the declines as well as their significance.
E The environmentalists, in attributing population declines to intentional human activity, have more likely underestimated than overestimated the effects of chance events on amphibian populations.

(D) They have probably been caused by a combination of chance events.
(E) They do not clearly constitute evidence of general environmental degradation.",E,"Inference

The author suggests throughout the passage that recently reported amphibian extinctions may have several different causes: they may be due to any number of chance events, for example, or may simply be the result of a small population that finds itself unable to continue under difficult conditions, whatever causes those conditions.

A The author states in the second paragraph that extinctions may occur without a proximate cause in human activities and does not make a commitment to any particular explanation of the amphibian extinctions.
B That chance events can cause extinctions suggests that even if habitats had been protected, extinctions still might have occurred.
C In the second paragraph, the author says that extinctions should come as no great surprise , but this option is imprecise. The amphibian populations have not generally been declining for a number of years . The author says in the third paragraph that amphibian populations show strong fluctuations; further, in the fourth paragraph, the author says that there is insufficient long-term data to conclude that amphibian populations have been, or are, in decline.
D The author suggests that the extinctions may have been caused by chance events, but there is not enough data to know whether or not this is probable.
E Correct. The reported extinctions could have resulted from several different causes; thus, they are not clear evidence of general environmental degradation.

, which may be caused by chance events. The possibility of their extinction, the passage states, depends only on the population size, and not whether that population is increasing or decreasing.

A The second paragraph mentions rarity as a characteristic of endangered amphibian species.
B According to the second paragraph, endangered amphibian species are generally those of small populations.
C The second paragraph states that an endangered population is under constant threat of extinction.
D Correct. The last sentence of the second paragraph states that the probability of extinction due to chance events is independent of how a population changes in size. Immediate extinction would more likely come from such events, whereas population decline is gradual, even if fairly rapid.
E Endangered species, according to the second paragraph, may become extinct due to chance events—that is, events that have nothing to do with human activities.

The correct answer is D.","There are recent reports of apparently drastic
 declines in amphibian populations and of extinctions
 of a number of the world’s endangered amphibian
 species. These declines, if real, may be signs of a
 general trend toward extinction, and many
 environmentalists have claimed that immediate
 environmental action is necessary to remedy this
 “amphibian crisis,” which, in their view, is an
 indicator of general and catastrophic environmental
 degradation due to human activity.
 To evaluate these claims, it is useful to make a
 preliminary distinction that is far too often ignored.
 A declining population should not be confused with
 an endangered one. An endangered population is
 always rare, almost always small, and, by definition,
 under constant threat of extinction even without a
 proximate cause in human activities. Its disappearance,
 however unfortunate, should come as no great
 surprise. Moreover, chance events—which may
 indicate nothing about the direction of trends in
 population size—may lead to its extinction. The
 probability of extinction due to such random factors
 depends on the population size and is independent
 of the prevailing direction of change in that size.
 For biologists, population declines are potentially
 more worrisome than extinctions. Persistent
 declines, especially in large populations, indicate a
 changed ecological context. Even here, distinctions
 must again be made among declines that are only
 apparent (in the sense that they are part of habitual
 cycles or of normal fluctuations), declines that take
 a population to some lower but still acceptable
 level, and those that threaten extinction (e.g., by
 taking the number of individuals below the minimum
 viable population). Anecdotal reports of population
 decreases cannot distinguish among these
 possibilities, and some amphibian populations have
 shown strong fluctuations in the past.
 It is indisputably true that there is simply not
 enough long-term scientific data on amphibian
 populations to enable researchers to identify real

This question asks about the organization of the passage as a whole. In the first paragraph, the author tells about a situation that has been interpreted in a particular way by environmentalists. The passage then proceeds to consider whether that interpretation is valid, and while it does not come to a definitive conclusion on that point, the final paragraph warns about the possible consequences of not taking the action recommended by the environmentalists.

A The passage does initially raise a question regarding whether the environmentalists’ interpretation of events is valid, but it does not answer that question, for the appropriate long-term data are not available.
B Correct. The passage presents environmentalists’ interpretation of recent news regarding amphibians, then examines the soundness of that interpretation. Finally, the author warns that postponing environmental action may have disastrous consequences.
C The first paragraph describes a situation of possibly drastic declines in amphibian populations but does not follow this description with an analysis of its consequences.
D The passage suggests that apparent declines in amphibian populations may or may not constitute a crisis, but it does not reject either idea.
E While the passage does imply, in its final paragraph, that long-term data on amphibian populations should be collected, the passage does not compare two methods for analyzing amphibian populations or population declines in those populations.

The sentence in question discusses the way in which anecdotal reports of population decreases cannot help biologists determine whether those decreases are normal fluctuations, take populations to lower levels that are not actually worrisome, or actually threaten extinctions. This indicates that the view mentioned in the first paragraph—reports of declines indicate a catastrophic crisis—may be mistaken.

A The sentence does not address a particular kind of study; it objects to the use of anecdotal reports in place of actual study.
B The previous sentence describes the possibilities referred to in the sentence in question. The sentence does not cast doubt on any of those possibilities.
C Correct. The view that reports of amphibian population declines indicate a crisis, as presented in the first paragraph, is countered by the objection here that there are several possible causes for population declines, and anecdotal reports cannot distinguish among those possibilities.
D The first paragraph is concerned with articulating the view that amphibian population declines constitute a crisis. This sentence does not support that view; instead, it offers reason to question it.
E The sentence introduces the idea that amphibian populations have fluctuated in the past, and the following paragraph supports this idea by stating that several amphibian species that appeared almost extinct in the 1950s and 1960s have recovered. Thus, the paragraph does not counter the sentence.

RCQ113,RCP22,"The passage mentions which of the following as a factor that affects the role of P. ochraceus as a keystone species within different habitats?
(A) The degree to which the habitat is sheltered from waves
(B) The degree to which other animals within a habitat prey on mussels
(C) The fact that mussel populations are often not dominant within some habitats occupied by P. ochraceus
(D) The size of the P. ochraceus population within the habitat
(E) The fact that there is great species diversity within some habitats occupied by P. ochraceus",B,"Supporting idea

This question depends on recognizing what the passage states about the factors affecting
P. ochraceus’s
role as a keystone species, which is different in different habitats. According to the passage,
P. ochraceus
consumes and suppresses mussel populations in some habitats—specifically, those that are wave-exposed—making it a keystone predator in those habitats. But in wave-sheltered habitats,
P. ochraceus
does not play the same role in suppressing mussel populations.

A Correct. The passage clearly states that P. ochraceus’s role in wave-exposed habitats differs from its role in wave-sheltered habitats.
B The passage says that the impact of P. ochraceus predation on mussels is not strong in wave-sheltered habitats, but this is not—at least not at all sites—because other animals are preying on the mussels; rather, at least at some sites, it is because mussels are controlled by sand burial.
C The passage does not suggest that mussel populations are dominant in any habitats occupied by P. ochraceus .
D The size of the P. ochraceus population affects the size of the mussel population within wave-exposed habitats, but the passage does not suggest that P. ochraceus’s role as a keystone species depends on the size of its population within those habitats.
E The only other species the passage mentions in conjunction with P. ochraceus habitats is the mussel; the passage does not address species diversity in these habitats.

The correct answer is A.","While the most abundant and dominant species
 within a particular ecosystem is often crucial in
 perpetuating the ecosystem, a “keystone” species,
 here defined as one whose effects are much larger
 than would be predicted from its abundance, can
 also play a vital role. But because complex species
 interactions may be involved, identifying a keystone
 species by removing the species and observing
 changes in the ecosystem is problematic. It might
 seem that certain traits would clearly define a
 species as a keystone species; for example,
 Pisaster ochraceus is often a keystone predator
 because it consumes and suppresses mussel
 populations, which in the absence of this starfish
 can be a dominant species. But such predation on a
 dominant or potentially dominant species occurs in
 systems that do as well as in systems that do not
 have species that play keystone roles. Moreover,
 whereas P. ochraceus occupies an unambiguous
 keystone role on wave-exposed rocky headlands,
 in more wave-sheltered habitats the impact of
 P. ochraceus predation is weak or nonexistent,
 and at certain sites sand burial is responsible for
 eliminating mussels. Keystone status appears to
 depend on context, whether of particular
 geography or of such factors as community
 diversity (for example, a reduction in species
 diversity may thrust more of the remaining species
 into keystone roles) and length of species
 interaction (since newly arrived species in particular
 may dramatically affect ecosystems)."
RCQ114,RCP22,"Which of the following hypothetical experiments most clearly exemplifies the method of identifying species’ roles that the author considers problematic?
(A) A population of seals in an Arctic habitat is counted in order to determine whether it is the dominant species in that ecosystem.
(B) A species of fish that is a keystone species in one marine ecosystem is introduced into another marine ecosystem to see whether the species will come to occupy a keystone role.
(C) In order to determine whether a species of monkey is a keystone species within a particular ecosystem, the monkeys are removed from that ecosystem and the ecosystem is then studied.
(D) Different mountain ecosystems are compared to determine how geography affects a particular species’ ability to dominate its ecosystem.
(E) In a grassland experiencing a changing climate, patterns of species extinction are traced in order to evaluate the effect of climate changes on keystone species in that grassland.",C,"Application

Answering this question depends on recognizing what the author says about identifying species’ roles in habitats and then extending that to another situation. The author considers a particular method of studying keystone species problematic: removing a suspected keystone species from its habitat and observing what happens to the ecosystem. The author finds this problematic because interactions among species are complex.

A The author does not discuss counting the members of a population as a problematic way of determining whether that population is a dominant species.
B The method that the author finds problematic has to do with observing what happens to an ecosystem when a keystone species is removed from it, not with observing what happens to a different ecosystem when the species is introduced into it.
C Correct. The author states explicitly that removing a species from a habitat in order to determine its keystone status is problematic. Removing the monkeys from their habitat is a clear example of this problematic practice.
D Comparison of habitats in order to determine geography’s effect on a particular species’ dominance would most likely find favor with the author, for this is the approach the author seems to advocate in investigating P. ochraceus ’s keystone status.
E The author does not discuss tracing patterns of extinction or changing climates in the passage.

The correct answer is C.","While the most abundant and dominant species

RCQ115,RCP22,"Which of the following, if true, would most clearly support the argument about keystone status advanced in the last sentence of the passage (lines 24–31)?
(A) A species of bat is primarily responsible for keeping insect populations within an ecosystem low, and the size of the insect population in turn affects bird species within that ecosystem.
(B) A species of iguana occupies a keystone role on certain tropical islands, but does not play that role on adjacent tropical islands that are inhabited by a greater number of animal species.
(C) Close observation of a savannah ecosystem reveals that more species occupy keystone roles within that ecosystem than biologists had previously believed.
(D) As a keystone species of bee becomes more abundant, it has a larger effect on the ecosystem it inhabits.
(E) A species of moth that occupies a keystone role in a prairie habitat develops coloration patterns that camouflage it from potential predators.",B,"Evaluation

To answer this question, focus on the argument advanced in the last sentence of the passage and identify what information would support that argument. In the last sentence of the passage, the author claims that keystone status depends on context. The author then offers three contextual factors that may affect a species’ keystone status: geography, community diversity (i.e., the number of species in a given habitat), and length of species interaction. Evidence supporting this argument would show that context is important to a species’ keystone status.

A This scenario does not indicate anything about keystone status; this is simply a description of how species populations in a single ecosystem affect one another.
B Correct. That the iguana is a keystone species in a location that has limited species diversity but not a keystone species in a location that has greater species diversity suggests that keystone status does indeed depend on context. Thus, this example supports the author’s argument in the last sentence of the passage.
C That biologists were mistaken about keystone species in a particular ecosystem does not have a bearing on whether keystone status is context dependent.
D It is not surprising that an increase in a species’ population would lead to that species having a larger effect on its ecosystem—but this does not speak directly to the question of whether keystone status itself depends on context.
E A keystone species enhancing its ability to survive in a single ecosystem does not lend any support to the idea that keystone status depends on context. The moth’s keystone status would have to undergo some change for this to have a bearing on the question of context.

The correct answer is B.","While the most abundant and dominant species

RCQ116,RCP22,"The passage suggests which of the following about the identification of a species as a keystone species?
(A) Such an identification depends primarily on the species’ relationship to the dominant species.
(B) Such an identification can best be made by removing the species from a particular ecosystem and observing changes that occur in the ecosystem.
(C) Such an identification is likely to be less reliable as an ecosystem becomes less diverse.
(D) Such an identification seems to depend on various factors within the ecosystem.
(E) Such an identification can best be made by observing predation behavior.",D,"Inference

Answering this question requires identifying how the passage suggests that keystone species should be identified. The passage identifies a particular way in which keystone status should
not
be determined: removing a species and observing what happens to the ecosystem. The passage also argues that keystone status depends strongly on context: that is, an ecosystem’s characteristics, including its geography and inhabitants, determine its keystone species.

A While the passage uses an example of a keystone species, P. ochraceus , which preys on a species that would, in the keystone species’ absence, be dominant, there is nothing to suggest that a keystone species must have a particular relationship with the dominant, or potentially dominant, species in an ecosystem.
B The passage explicitly states that this method of identification would be problematic.
C A reduction in an ecosystem’s diversity might alter which species occupy keystone roles in that ecosystem, the passage suggests, but there is no indication that identifying such species would become more difficult.
D Correct. If, as the passage suggests, keystone status for any given species depends on the context of the ecosystem in which it lives, then it is likely that identifying keystone species depends strongly on understanding what factors of the ecosystem contribute to creating keystone status. The passage lists such factors as geography, community diversity, and species interaction.
E While the passage uses a predator, P. ochraceus , as its example of a keystone species, there is no indication that predation is an essential component of the actual definition of keystone species ( one whose effects are much larger than would be predicted from its abundance ).

The correct answer is D.","While the most abundant and dominant species

E The authors do not discuss new techniques in this passage.

The correct answer is C.","After evidence was obtained in the 1920s that
 the universe is expanding, it became reasonable to
 ask: Will the universe continue to expand
 indefinitely, or is there enough mass in it for the
 mutual attraction of its constituents to bring this

 critical density of matter needed to brake the
 expansion and “close” the universe is equivalent to
 three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. But the
 density of the observable universe—luminous
 matter in the form of galaxies—comes to only a
 fraction of this. If the expansion of the universe is
 to stop, there must be enough invisible matter in
 the universe to exceed the luminous matter in
 density by a factor of roughly 70.
 Our contribution to the search for this “missing

 galaxies at various distances from their center of
 rotation. It has been known for some time that
 outside the bright nucleus of a typical spiral galaxy
 luminosity falls off rapidly with distance from the
 center. If luminosity were a true indicator of mass,
 most of the mass would be concentrated toward
 the center. Outside the nucleus the rotational
 velocity would decrease geometrically with
 distance from the center, in conformity with
 Kepler’s law. Instead we have found that the
 rotational velocity in spiral galaxies either remains
 constant with increasing distance from the center

 distance from the center is balanced by an
 increase in nonluminous mass.

In the second paragraph, the authors observe that

The authors’ conclusion about nonluminous matter is based on their study of the rotational velocity of spiral galaxies. If spiral galaxies were found to be atypical of galaxies, then it would be possible that, in those other galaxies, nonluminous matter does not increase as luminous matter decreases. If this were the case, the authors’ conclusion would be based on a sample of galaxies not representative of the whole, and their argument would be seriously weakened.

A Correct. The authors’ conclusion assumes that spiral galaxies are typical of all galaxies; information calling that assumption into question weakens the argument.
B The relation rather than the composition of luminous and nonluminous mass is relevant to the conclusion.
C Nonluminous mass increases as luminous mass decreases: This finding does not rule out that the nucleus contains some nonluminous mass; the argument is not affected.

 rotation. It has been known for some time that
 outside the bright nucleus of a typical spiral galaxy
 luminosity falls off rapidly with distance from the
 center. If luminosity were a true indicator of mass,
 most of the mass would be concentrated toward
 the center. Outside the nucleus the rotational
 velocity would decrease geometrically with
 distance from the center, in conformity with
 Kepler’s law. Instead we have found that the
 rotational velocity in spiral galaxies either remains
 constant with increasing distance from the center
 or increases slightly. This unexpected result
 indicates that the falloff in luminous mass with
 distance from the center is balanced by an
 increase in nonluminous mass.
 Our findings suggest that as much as 90 percent
 of the mass of the universe is not radiating at any
 wavelength with enough intensity to be detected
 on the Earth. Such dark matter could be in the
 form of extremely dim stars of low mass, of large
 planets like Jupiter, or of black holes, either small
 or massive. While it has not yet been determined
 whether this mass is sufficient to close the
 universe, some physicists consider it significant
 that estimates are converging on the critical value."
RCQ120,RCP23,"It can be inferred from information presented in the passage that if the density of the universe were equivalent to significantly less than three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter, which of the following would be true as a consequence?
(A) Luminosity would be a true indicator of mass.
(B) Different regions in spiral galaxies would rotate at the same velocity.
(C) The universe would continue to expand indefinitely.
(D) The density of the invisible matter in the universe would have to be more than 70 times the density of the luminous matter.
(E) More of the invisible matter in spiral galaxies would have to be located in their nuclei than in their outer regions.",C,"Inference

An inference is drawn from stated information. This question refers to the first paragraph, where the authors explain that
the critical density of matter needed to brake the expansion and “close” the universe is equivalent to three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter
(lines 6–9). If the density is significantly less, then the universe will not “
close
” but continue to expand indefinitely.

A The authors’ finding that luminosity is not a true indicator of mass is not derived from the conclusion that the density is less than three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.
B The authors’ finding that different regions rotate at similar velocities does not come from the hypothesis about the density of the universe.
C Correct. If the critical density needed to “ close ” the universe is equivalent to three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter, then a density of significantly less than this amount means that the universe will continue its expansion.
D This statement would be true of the hypothetical “ close ” of the universe, but if the density is less than three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter, the universe will continue its expansion.
E This statement cannot be inferred from the hypothesis about the density of the universe.

The correct answer is C.","After evidence was obtained in the 1920s that
 the universe is expanding, it became reasonable to
 ask: Will the universe continue to expand
 indefinitely, or is there enough mass in it for the
 mutual attraction of its constituents to bring this
 expansion to a halt? It can be calculated that the
 critical density of matter needed to brake the
 expansion and “close” the universe is equivalent to
 three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. But the
 density of the observable universe—luminous
 matter in the form of galaxies—comes to only a
 fraction of this. If the expansion of the universe is
 to stop, there must be enough invisible matter in
 the universe to exceed the luminous matter in
 density by a factor of roughly 70.

This question asks for an assessment of what the passage as a whole is doing. The passage introduces Clark’s study as a
solid contribution
(line 3) to the debate between technological determinists and social constructivists. In the second paragraph, Braverman is introduced as holding a position of social constructivism, a position that Clark takes issue with. In the final paragraph, the passage holds that
Clark refutes the extremes of the constructivists
(line 31), and Clark’s arguments challenging social constructivism are then described.

A The passage takes no position on the merits of technological change but is concerned only with the role of such change in society.
B The passage mentions telephone exchange workers as an example that helps illustrate the more central debate between determinists and constructivists.
C Correct. The passage is mainly concerned with portraying Clark’s view as a successful challenge to constructivism.
D The passage describes Clark’s view as a successful challenge to social constructivism, not technological determinism.

 the way machinery reflects social choices. For
 Braverman, the shape of a technological system is

This question requires recognizing information contained in the passage. The passage states in the first paragraph that Clark’s study focused on the modernization of a telephone exchange and the effect this had on maintenance work and workers. After describing Braverman’s analysis in the second paragraph as being at odds with Clark’s views, the passage discusses Clark’s views in more detail in the final paragraph. As part of this discussion, the passage notes that Clark shows how a change from
maintenance-intensive electromechanical switches to semielectronic switching
systems
at the telephone exchange
altered work tasks, skills, training opportunities, administration, and organization of workers
(lines 42–44). Thus, the passage shows that the modernization of the telephone exchange affected much more than maintenance routines.

A The passage does not discuss whether new technology reduces the role of managers in labor negotiations.
B The passage does not discuss the role of employee consent in the modernization of the telephone exchange.
C Correct. The passage states that the modernization of the telephone exchange affected tasks, skills, training, administration, and the organization of workers.

Answering this question requires inferring what the passage’s author likely believes. The passage describes Braverman’s position as one of mainstream social constructivism (lines 23–24), a position that Clark takes issue with. Although it describes Braverman’s position, the rest of the passage is devoted to showing how Clark’s position takes issue with Braverman’s. In the second paragraph, the passage describes Clark as holding that
technology can be a primary determinant of social and managerial organization
(lines 9–11), which suggests that managers are sometimes subordinate to technological change. In lines 15–17, however, Braverman is described as holding that
the shape of a technological system is subordinate to the manager’s desire to wrest control of the labor process from the workers
, which shows that Clark and Braverman are at odds on this point.

A Since the passage says that Clark believes an important insight has been obscured by the recent sociological fashion that Braverman’s views exemplify (lines 11–14), one cannot infer that Clark respects the popularity of Braverman’s views.
B Correct. The passage shows that Clark believes managers to have less influence over how technology affects an organization than Braverman claims that they have.

 mainstream called social constructivism.
 The constructivists gain acceptance by
 misrepresenting technological determinism:
 technological determinists are supposed to believe,
 for example, that machinery imposes appropriate
 forms of order on society. The alternative to
 constructivism, in other words, is to view technology
 as existing outside society, capable of directly
 influencing skills and work organization.
 Clark refutes the extremes of the constructivists
 by both theoretical and empirical arguments.
 Theoretically he defines “technology” in terms of
 relationships between social and technical variables.

 cold, hard metal are bound to fail, for machinery is
 just scrap unless it is organized functionally and
 supported by appropriate systems of operation and
 maintenance. At the empirical level Clark shows how
 a change at the telephone exchange from
 maintenance-intensive electromechanical switches to
 semielectronic switching systems altered work
 tasks, skills, training opportunities, administration,
 and organization of workers. Some changes Clark
 attributes to the particular way management and
 labor unions negotiated the introduction of the
 technology, whereas others are seen as arising from
 the capabilities and nature of the technology itself.

RCQ129,RCP24,"Which of the following statements about Clark’s study of the telephone exchange can be inferred from information in the passage?
(A) Clark’s reason for undertaking the study was to undermine Braverman’s analysis of the function of technology.
(B) Clark’s study suggests that the implementation of technology should be discussed in the context of conflict between labor and management.
(C) Clark examined the impact of changes in the technology of switching at the exchange in terms of overall operations and organization.
(D) Clark concluded that the implementation of new switching technology was equally beneficial to management and labor.
(E) Clark’s analysis of the change in switching systems applies only narrowly to the situation at the particular exchange that he studied.",C,"Inference

This question requires understanding what the passage implies in its discussion of a point of view. The details of Clark’s views are discussed primarily in the final paragraph. The passage states that on an empirical level, Clark demonstrates that technological change regarding switches at the telephone exchange
altered work tasks, skills, training opportunities, administration, and organization of workers
(lines 42–44). The passage goes on to state Clark’s contention that these changes even influenced negotiations between management and labor unions.

A The passage indicates that Clark’s study addressed the extremes of both technological determinism and social constructivism. It cites Braverman as a proponent of social constructivism but provides no evidence that Clark’s motivation in beginning his study was specifically to target an analysis offered by Braverman.
B The passage indicates that Clark attributed some organizational change to the way labor and management negotiated the introduction of technology but does not mention conflict between them.
C Correct. According to the passage, Clark concludes that changes to the technology of switches had an influence on several aspects of the overall operations and organization of the telephone exchange.
D The passage does not indicate that Clark assesses the benefits of technological change to either labor or management.
E The passage indicates that Clark believes the change in switching technology influenced many aspects of the overall operations of the telephone exchange.

The correct answer is C.","Jon Clark’s study of the effect of the modernization
 of a telephone exchange on exchange maintenance
 work and workers is a solid contribution to a debate
 that encompasses two lively issues in the history and
 sociology of technology: technological determinism
 and social constructivism.
 Clark makes the point that the characteristics of a
 technology have a decisive influence on job skills and
 work organization. Put more strongly, technology can
 be a primary determinant of social and managerial
 organization. Clark believes this possibility has been
 obscured by the recent sociological fashion,
 exemplified by Braverman’s analysis, that emphasizes
 the way machinery reflects social choices. For
 Braverman, the shape of a technological system is
 subordinate to the manager’s desire to wrest control
 of the labor process from the workers. Technological
 change is construed as the outcome of negotiations
 among interested parties who seek to incorporate
 their own interests into the design and configuration
 of the machinery. This position represents the new
 mainstream called social constructivism.

with men, and then follows that by noting how feminist scholars have
repeatedly cited
this view to contrast it with extensive evidence of women’s inequality during the Renaissance.

A The passage does not indicate that any feminist scholars cite Burckhardt to refute Kelly’s view. It uses Krontiris as an example of scholars who refute Kelly’s point of view to a certain degree, but Krontiris does not use Burckhardt’s view as her basis for doing so; Krontiris argues against Burckhardt as well.

C Correct. Krontiris’s work illustrates the “cautiously optimistic” view by embracing both the idea that Renaissance women could gain a certain amount of power and the idea that the extent of their opposition was limited.

D The author describes calculations about tunneling time and barrier thickness in order to explain that particles engaged in quantum tunneling may in fact achieve extremely high speeds, not to explain the rarity of the phenomenon.
E Correct. The calculations about tunneling time and barrier thickness supported Wigner and Eisenbud’s hypothesis that quantum tunneling could occur at speeds faster than that of light.

The correct answer is E.","Most attempts by physicists to send particles
 faster than the speed of light involve a remarkable
 phenomenon called quantum tunneling, in which
 particles travel through solid barriers that appear to
 be impenetrable. If you throw a ball at a wall, you
 expect it to bounce back, not to pass straight
 through it. Yet subatomic particles perform the
 equivalent feat. Quantum theory says that there is a
 distinct, albeit small, probability that such a particle
 will tunnel its way through a barrier; the probability
 declines exponentially as the thickness of the
 barrier increases. Though the extreme rapidity of
 quantum tunneling was noted as early as 1932, not
 until 1955 was it hypothesized—by Wigner and
 Eisenbud—that tunneling particles sometimes
 travel faster than light. Their grounds were
 calculations that suggested that the time it takes a
 particle to tunnel through a barrier increases with
 the thickness of the barrier until tunneling time
 reaches a maximum; beyond that maximum,
 tunneling time stays the same regardless of barrier
 thickness. This would imply that once maximum
 tunneling time is reached, tunneling speed will
 increase without limit as barrier thickness
 increases. Several recent experiments have
 supported this hypothesis that tunneling particles
 sometimes reach superluminal speed. According to
 measurements performed by Raymond Chiao and
 colleagues, for example, photons can pass through
 an optical filter at 1.7 times the speed of light."
RCQ138,RCP26,"The passage implies that if tunneling time reached no maximum in increasing with barrier thickness, then
(A) tunneling speed would increase with barrier thickness
(B) tunneling speed would decline with barrier thickness
(C) tunneling speed would vary with barrier thickness
(D) tunneling speed would not be expected to increase without limit
(E) successful tunneling would occur even less frequently than it does",D,"Inference

The passage states that because tunneling time reaches a maximum, then tunneling speed must increase as barrier thickness increases. But if tunneling time did not reach such a maximum, then speed need not increase without limit; the particle could have as low a speed in thicker barriers as in thinner ones and take longer to tunnel through a barrier.

A If tunneling time could not reach a maximum, then speed might increase, decrease, or remain the same as barrier thickness increases.
B If tunneling time could not reach a maximum, then speed might increase, decrease, or remain the same as barrier thickness increases.
C Tunneling speed could vary with barrier thickness if tunneling time could not reach a maximum, but there is no basis in the passage on which to conclude that this is definitely so.
D Correct. The tunneling particle could have as lower a speed in thicker barriers as in thinner ones and simply take longer to make its way through a thicker barrier.
E The passage states that the probability of successful tunneling declines as the thickness of the barrier increases. However, it does not address the issue of whether the differences in probability of successful tunneling are due to the greater time required to go through thicker barriers.

RCQ139,RCP26,"Which of the following statements about the earliest scientific investigators of quantum tunneling can be inferred from the passage?

(B) They anticipated the later results of Chiao and his colleagues.
(C) They did not suppose that tunneling particles could travel faster than light.
(D) They were unable to observe instances of successful tunneling.
(E) They made use of photons to study the phenomenon of tunneling.",C,"Inference

This question asks about the earliest investigators of quantum tunneling. The passage notes that quantum tunneling’s
extreme rapidity
was observed in 1932; thus, the earliest investigators of this phenomenon knew of its existence at that time. Not until 1955 did Wigner and Eisenbud hypothesize that the particles traveled faster than light. Thus, it is logical to infer that the earliest investigators did not imagine such a speed.

A There is nothing in the passage to suggest that the earliest investigators of quantum tunneling had difficulty manipulating barrier thickness.
B The passage states that Chiao and his colleagues measured photons moving at 1.7 times the speed of light—but the passage does not provide evidence that the earliest investigators anticipated such speeds.
C Correct. The passage suggests that prior to 1955, investigators of quantum tunneling had not hypothesized that the particles could travel faster than the speed of light.
D The passage indicates that by 1932, investigators had noted the rapidity of quantum tunneling; although this does not entail that they observed the phenomenon, it is consistent with their having been able to do so.
E The passage indicates that Chiao’s work involves photons, but it does not indicate the type of particles used or observed by the earliest investigators of the phenomenon.
